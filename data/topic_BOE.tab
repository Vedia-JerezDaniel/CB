2008-01-22	"Speech given by Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England  At a dinner hosted by the IoD South West and the CBI at the Ashton Gate Stadium, Bristol 22 January 2008  1  All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx  It is four months since Northern Rock came to the Bank of England for support. And the headlines continue to be dominated by its fate. Northern Rock, however, is not the epicentre of the present global banking crisis. That lies in the very substantial losses made by many banks in the main financial centres as a result of the collapse of the US sub-prime mortgage market.  Those losses, and the fear of future losses on a wider range of loans, pose a threat to the ability of the banking system to finance continued economic growth � the so-called credit crunch. Concerns about the implications of a credit crunch, not only for the health of the US but for the world economy, lie behind the sharp falls in global equity markets over the past week. So the next year will pose economic challenges for all of us � more so than at any time since the Bank of England was given its independence in 1997.  Both industrialised and emerging market economies have been affected by the fall in asset prices but conditions vary across countries. It is striking that the banking crisis originated at the heart of the world�s major financial centres. And the country most severely affected is the United States where the Federal Reserve today cut interest rates by 75 basis points � the largest reduction since August 1982 � to mitigate �increasing downside risks to growth�. The contraction in the US housing market has deepened and unemployment there is rising.  I want tonight to explain the nature of the challenges facing us and why many of them originate outside our shores. Exactly five hundred years before the Bank of England was given its independence, an Italian migrant who had made his home in Bristol, Giovanni Caboto, or John Cabot as he was known, set sail from this great city in May 1497 and became the first European to land on the North American mainland since the Vikings. A seafaring voyage like Cabot�s is a good analogy for the challenges facing the British economy, which will have to navigate some distinctly choppy waters in 2008.  2  The challenge to the Monetary Policy Committee�s ability to navigate our way through the next year reflects two strong economic winds; one from the west and one from the east. They correspond to what economists call demand and supply shocks. The former is the credit crunch which has blown across the Atlantic, and threatens a sharp slowing in output growth. The latter is the rise in energy and food prices, reflecting continued strong growth in Asia, that, together with rising import prices, threaten to lift inflation noticeably above target in the coming months. These two winds have stirred up the water through which the UK economy must pass.  The westerly gale first hit us in August as developments in the US mortgage market led to turmoil in global financial markets. For some years, banks were able to borrow cheaply in world capital markets to expand their lending. They packaged the resulting loans and sold assets backed by those loans to capital market investors. They were able to do that because some investors had failed to adjust to lower rates of return caused by high savings in emerging economies and low inflation at home. Those investors engaged in a �search for yield� by buying risky assets without always understanding fully the risks attached to them. Families and businesses had access to more finance at lower cost. That was most obvious in the growth of the US sub-prime mortgage market, where the potential problem of lending to people who could not repay when the interest rate was reset on their floating rate mortgages was becoming only too clear. In the United Kingdom too, borrowing and spending growth were strong and inflationary pressures built up.  But in August all that changed dramatically. Rising default rates in the US mortgage market led investors around the world to question whether they were being adequately compensated for the risks they were bearing on a wide range of assets � not just those associated with sub-prime mortgages. The prices of those assets fell, and markets closed for a range of complex credit instruments.  As I said two years ago, �risk premia have become unusually compressed and the expansion of money and credit may have encouraged investors to take on more risk than  3  hitherto without demanding a higher return. It is questionable whether such behaviour can persist�. And, as we have seen, it hasn�t. The re-pricing of risk that is still continuing is not a process that we should try to reverse.  Adjustment to this has been painful for banks in the major financial centres in two ways. First, with some asset markets closed, banks found funding more difficult. Some needed to finance loans they had made but had then expected to package up and sell. Others needed to finance off-balance sheet investment vehicles that were no longer able to fund themselves.  At the outset of the crisis, banks were concerned to protect their liquidity position. But increasingly, attention has turned to a second, more fundamental concern. As a range of asset prices fell, banks began to report large losses. Uncertainty about the scale and location of losses led to concerns about the adequacy of bank capital and hence the ability of the banking system to finance continued economic expansion. At the end of last year, sentiment in financial markets worsened markedly. So in mid-December, central banks around the world announced a co-ordinated set of actions in money markets. These were designed to boost confidence by demonstrating that we were conscious of the risks of a credit crunch.  Since those actions, conditions in money markets have eased considerably. The benchmark 3-month interbank lending rate has fallen by around 75 basis points relative to expected policy rates. But conditions are not yet back to normal and remain fragile. Although central banks can and will respond to the consequences of strains in the banking system for their economies, the solution to the underlying problem does not rest with them but with the banks and financial markets themselves. Banks must reveal losses promptly, and, most importantly, raise new capital where necessary.  But these developments in financial markets and the banking system have started to affect activity in the economy more widely. Interest rates charged to both households and companies have risen relative to Bank Rate, reversing the relative fall in the year or so  4  before last August. And our own survey of credit conditions last month revealed that lenders intend to tighten conditions further this year. This tightening is unlikely to be short-lived.  Tighter conditions will discourage borrowing to finance spending on residential and commercial property, on business investment and on consumption. The impact on property prices is already clearly visible. Commercial property prices have fallen by 12% since the middle of last year. And, after rising sharply earlier in 2007, house prices stagnated in the final quarter. Although there is a considerable stock of equity in owneroccupied housing, with banks tightening the supply of both secured and unsecured credit, consumers will find it more difficult to borrow to finance spending. So in 2008 it is likely that a less buoyant housing market will go hand in hand with slower growth of consumer spending.  Tighter credit conditions mean that, as a nation, we are likely to save more of our income this year than in the recent past. In the short run, that will slow economic activity, possibly quite sharply. And there is a risk that weaker activity and lower asset prices could result in another round of losses for banks and a further tightening of credit conditions.  The adjustment which not only the British but the world economy is experiencing is necessary as the imbalances, between spending and saving and between domestic demand and trade, unwind. As part of a longer-run rebalancing of the UK economy, an increase in our national saving rate, both private and public, is necessary. The low level of national saving is apparent from the current account deficit � our new net borrowing from overseas � which in the third quarter of last year was, relative to GDP, the biggest in the past fifty years and the largest in the G7. It is possible to run a current account deficit for a considerable period. Australia, for example, has done so in every year since 1974. But our own position is becoming more difficult. For some years we have been able to finance current account deficits by borrowing, often through banks, at unusually low interest rates on world capital markets. Such borrowing is now becoming more  5  expensive. Unless we spend less and save more, our current account position will deteriorate.  If we are to raise our national saving rate without overall demand, output and employment suffering in the medium term, we will need to export more and import less. Such a rebalancing is helped by the fall in sterling�s effective exchange rate. Sterling has fallen, against a trade-weighted basket of currencies by almost 10% since August. And financial markets are pricing in a significant probability of a further decline in the exchange rate during this year.  A lower average level of the exchange rate can, by supporting overall economic activity, help protect us from the worst effects of the wind blowing across the Atlantic. But, by pushing up import prices, it will exacerbate the impact of the other wind now buffeting the UK economy, which comes from the east � the inflationary effect of higher energy and food prices. Strong growth of demand, particularly from China, India and other emerging markets in Asia, has been a key driver of the sustained rises in commodity prices over recent years, most notably oil prices.  Inflation has picked up in the industrialised world. It is now 3.1% in the euro area and 4.1% in the United States. And although consumer price inflation here is close to target at 2.1%, three developments now threaten to push it significantly above target this year. First, oil prices are around $90 a barrel, although they have fallen back in recent days. In August, the price was $70. Second, oil price increases have been accompanied by rising gas prices in wholesale markets. And this month we have seen announcements from suppliers of increases in household gas and electricity bills of the order of 15%. Third, world food prices have risen sharply as a result of strong demand growth on the one hand and poor harvests from South Australia to North Carolina on the other. Food prices on world markets are a third higher than they were six months ago, and that has been feeding through to prices in the shops. Food price inflation in our own Consumer Price Index reached almost 6% in December.  6  So 2008 is likely to see higher energy prices, higher food prices and, with a lower exchange rate, higher import prices, pushing inflation above the 2% target. It is possible that inflation could rise to the level at which I would need to write an open letter of explanation, possibly more than one, to the Chancellor. Although there is little we can do now to avoid some rise in inflation this year, the task of the Monetary Policy Committee is to ensure that it is short-lived. If inflation expectations were to pick up in the wake of a rise in inflation this year, then only a more prolonged slowdown would allow inflation to return to target. But if the rise in inflation does not affect longer-term expectations, then inflation could start to fall back towards the end of the year.  We are determined to keep inflation on track to meet the 2% target in the medium term. When the Monetary Policy Committee sets Bank Rate, it has to balance the risk that a sharp slowing in activity, by creating a margin of spare capacity, would pull inflation below the target, against the risk that, without such a margin of spare capacity, higher inflation in the short term might have a tendency to persist. So we face a difficult balancing act in the course of 2008. But we start the year from a position in which Bank Rate, at 5.5%, is probably bearing down on demand.  After a decade and more of a non-inflationary consistently expansionary (nice) economy, a phrase I coined in 2003, we moved to a somewhat bumpier but still rather stable path, which I described the following year as the not-so-bad period. You might think we have now entered a not-so-good period. To put it bluntly, this year we are probably facing a period of above target inflation and a marked slowing in growth.  Although we have little control over the strength of the economic winds buffeting our economy, our framework of inflation targeting does, as I said in my first speech as Governor almost five years ago, provide a seaworthy vessel. We cannot avoid some volatility in the short run and it is important that everyone understands the limits to the ability of central banks to smooth the economy. But, by keeping our eye firmly on the need to keep inflation close to target in the medium term, we can reach the calmer waters of low inflation, steady growth and a better balanced economy. And our policy  7  framework will, I hope, allow you not to be overwhelmed by the headlines and to focus on what really matters for our future prosperity � the successful running of your own businesses.

2008-03-19	"Sovereign Wealth Funds and Global Imbalances Speech given by Sir John Gieve, Deputy Governor, Bank of England  Sovereign Wealth Management conference, London 14 March 2008  Acknowledgements if applicable. Double click here to edit/delete 1  All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx  Introduction  Much of the debate on sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) has focused on political questions: do they reintroduce the failings of public ownership into market economies by the back door, will SWFs use their ownership rights to pursue political ends, and will resistance to foreign ownership lead to a new wave of protectionism. I want to concentrate today on some economic issues: why have they become so prominent recently, how does that relate to imbalances in the world economy, how are they affecting financial markets and what are the policy implications of their growth.  Background  But first let me set out some of the background.  There is no off the shelf definition of an SWF. What I have in mind is a government investment vehicle that manages foreign assets with a higher risk tolerance and higher expected returns than for central bank foreign currency reserves.1 The size of such funds is hard to measure, but may be in the $2-3 trillion range.  Origins of SWFs  Investments by SWFs are one type of capital flow between countries so they have always been closely related to global imbalances in trade. When countries run surpluses on their current account, they generate equal and opposite net capital outflows of one sort or another and those capital flows produce an investment income.  That has been the story of the UK economy over the last 150 years. We ran continuous surpluses in the 50 years before the first world war (Chart 1) and built up a large stock of 1  There is some fuzziness at the edges of this definition. Central bank reserves in some countries, which traditionally have been invested mainly in liquid and safe instruments, are increasingly being switched into riskier assets. Also, in some countries, state-owned banks and companies invest in foreign assets where some of the policy issues are the same as for sovereign wealth funds.  foreign assets. Partly as a result of that, we benefited from a surplus on our investment account for most of the period since the 1870s.  There are two key differences between that period of the UK�s investment abroad and the situation today. 100 years ago the developed countries were investing in emerging markets (at the time in the Americas and Australia) which had abundant land and natural resources but scarce capital and so the returns were high. Currently, capital is flowing �uphill� from emerging to mature economies. Secondly, the investors before were mainly in the private sector and were seeking out the best returns on capital. Today the investors are mainly EME central banks and governments and the build up of foreign assets reflects their policy choices.  Modern sovereign wealth funds are not new, in fact the first � the Kuwait Investment Office � was set up here in London in February 1953 � just as Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were setting out to climb Everest.3 And the number of funds has been increasing since then like the traffic on the slopes of Everest.  The next wave were set up by other oil producers after the price increases in the 70s and 80s for persuasive reasons (Chart 2). First oil is a non-renewable resource so it can make sense for governments to spread the benefits of this endowment across generations by investing part of today�s income in assets that will provide an income tomorrow. That would be so even if the path of oil prices was predictable but in fact it is not. That uncertainty about future income provides a second case for saving today. In the late 1970s, some oil exporters increased spending to match higher incomes and faced a painful adjustment when prices fell back again. Third, even if the rise in income was permanent there would be a case for phasing the growth of domestic spending and investment to prevent supply bottlenecks leading to inflation. 3  The Kuwait Investment Office is the in-house investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Authority (formerly known as the Kuwait Investment Board) and was established by Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem AlSabah on 23 February 1953. Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reached the summit on 29 May 1953.  Recent growth of SWFs  Since the millennium at least 10 new SWFs have been set up and there are reports of plans for more for example in Brazil, Japan and India.  This reflects the remarkable shift of emerging-market economies from debtors to creditors. Ten years ago � at the time of the Asian crisis � emerging markets as a whole were running a current account deficit. Since then they have been running progressively bigger current account surpluses reaching an estimated $685 billion last year (1.3 % of world GDP).4 The counterpart to this is that developed countries as a group have been running progressively bigger current account deficits not just in the United States but also in a number of other developed countries including the UK.5 Of course there are some notable exceptions in each group: Canada, Japan and Germany for example are still creditors while many countries in central and eastern Europe and Africa are running large deficits. But maps 1 and 2 show how much the pattern has changed in the last 10 years. Most of South America and South East Asia have swung from deficit to surplus. Perhaps as important, the scale of the differences has grown with more countries running surpluses or deficits of over 5% of GDP.  Oil and other commodity inflation is part of the story, of course, but that does not account for the large current surpluses in most of East Asia. In China strong manufacturing growth resulting from higher labour productivity has not been matched by higher domestic spending so savings have grown ahead of even dramatic investment growth. A deliberate policy of fostering export industrial growth has slowed the rise of exchange rates that would reduce these imbalances.  4  These figures include the NICs. Excluding NICs the estimated surplus is $596 billion (1.1%).  5 Latest data show that current account deficits were 5% of GDP or above not only in the United States but also in Spain, Greece, Portugal, Australia, New Zealand, UK and Iceland.  As a result the build-up in EME foreign assets have been held mainly as central bank reserves especially in Asian countries (Chart 3). In total the foreign assets now held by EME central banks and governments is about $7 trillion dollars, which compares with only $60 billion gross foreign assets held by the UK government. Many emerging economies concluded after the Asian crisis a decade ago that they needed bigger liquid reserves in traditional government debt to defend themselves against volatility in financial markets even when that carried the likelihood of a negative return (taking account of expected exchange rate movements). But when the reserves outstripped the levels needed for that purpose, it was natural to look to increase the returns on investment by widening the range of investments.6  And in the next few years, these current account surpluses are likely to remain high and the build up of foreign assets by governments in oil exporting and Asian countries is likely to continue. According to the IMF�s forecasts, the combined current account surplus of China and oil-exporting countries will be around $800 billion over the next 3 years. And the IMF estimates that sovereign wealth fund assets could grow to $6-10 trillion within the next 5 years.  The impact of SWFs on financial markets  These are huge numbers and SWFs have become prominent and important players in many financial markets. But we should not exaggerate their impact on the global financial system. In aggregate, their assets under management are currently only less than one-twentieth of those held by private sector participants such as pension, insurance and mutual funds as well as hedge funds and private equity (Chart 4). And they account for about 2% of the total size of equity and bond markets globally. Even in five years time � and on some of the fastest growth projections � assets under management by sovereign wealth funds are projected to reach only about 6% of global financial assets.7 Moreover, 6  Foreign reserves held by EME central banks as a whole are about 60% (close to $3 trillion) higher than needed for conventional precautionary reasons to cover short-term external debt. 7  Morgan Stanley, ""Sovereign Wealth Funds and Bond and Equity Prices"", 31 May 2007.  though they have more assets under management than hedge funds they have smaller investments since they are not leveraged.8  It is not difficult to identify positive effects on the world�s capital markets. Sovereign wealth funds have long investment horizons and generally have no commercial liabilities. Therefore, in periods of market stress they are likely to face less pressure than most private investors to reduce the size or increase the liquidity of their investments. They are well placed to play a contrarian role and help to stabilise markets by investing in times of stress. For example, when the global equity market fell sharply between 2000 and 2002, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund was a large buyer of global equities. And a number of sovereign wealth funds have played an important and welcome stabilising role during the current turmoil by providing around $40 billion of new capital since November to some of the world�s biggest commercial and investment banks (Table 1).9  Taking a broader view, the switch of some reserves from government debt into SWFs which invest in a wider range of instruments should help to improve the allocation of resources if these investments are based on commercial criteria. Investing in equities may also help to reinforce and bring to the surface the common interest that EMEs and the advanced economies have in the good performance of the companies involved and the markets they operate in. It may thus help to integrate EMEs into the global financial system and encourage them to participate more in global policy making.  From a parochial point of view, the prospective increase in demand for equities relative to bonds could have a positive impact on London and sterling. Whereas the value of the UK market for public debt securities is only 3.3% of the global market, UK equities account for 7�% of the value of global equities. The rapid growth in sovereign wealth funds is also a fillip for London as a leading international financial centre. 8  That said, the assets held by sovereign wealth funds are highly concentrated, with around 70% of total assets held by the five largest funds. So the largest sovereign wealth funds could have an impact on some markets especially smaller ones such as other EMEs. 9  Also, a number of central banks from countries with large current account surpluses have been willing throughout the current liquidity crisis to lend to international banks, including UK ones, at longer, three-totwelve month, maturities.  SWFs and transparency  The main doubts concern their objectives and how far their investments will be driven only by financial returns.  Public sector owners might have other objectives including national political interests, such as, accessing military technology, controlling strategic resources or markets, and influencing public opinion.10 There are often complaints that sovereign wealth funds lack transparency. Decoded, this is a request for reassurance about their investment policies.  I am certainly not going to argue against more transparency (except in the very special case of the market operations of central banks). More openness from SWFs may help to alleviate concerns in recipient countries � and thus reduce protectionist pressures. And it may improve the dissemination of information to market participants and to their own citizens. I know many SWFs are working with the IMF to produce a voluntary code of conduct that is based on best practices for the governance and transparency of sovereign wealth funds. For example, it would be helpful if all sovereign wealth funds were transparent about their overall strategies, objectives and broad investment guidelines. Norway�s Government Pension Fund is a good example in this respect.  But there should be a level playing field applied to all investors. The case for greater transparency applies to other investors too. SWFs may take some comfort that they are not being singled out and that there are equally powerful pressures for transparency on hedge funds and private equity investors. In this respect, two recent initiatives are particularly welcome. First, a report under the chairmanship of Sir Andrew Large � my predecessor as Deputy Governor for Financial Stability at the Bank � on voluntary standards, including on disclosure, for hedge funds. And, second, a report by Sir David  10  Note though that this distinction between foreign public and private sector owners is not cut and dried. Foreign private sector purchases of football teams or newspapers do not always seem to be driven by the profit motive.  Walker � a former Executive Director of the Bank � on guidelines for disclosure and transparency by private equity funds.11  And transparency should not be one sided among countries. I know SWFs themselves are often keen for more transparency from recipient countries on whether and how far they are welcome and the rules of engagement.  The UK in recent years has been unusually open to foreign investors and foreign ownership both in comparison to our past and in comparison to most other developed (and emerging) countries today. We have relied on regulation of infrastructure industries and on competition law to prevent the abuse of market power and most of our utilities, much of the financial sector, as well as an increasing number of our leading football clubs have come into foreign ownership. In its latest survey of international direct investment trends, the OECD ranked the UK as having one of the least restrictive regulatory environment for foreign direct investment across all OECD member countries (Chart 5). And the UK has welcomed a number of SWFs to London as a base for international operations.  Sovereign wealth funds and global imbalances  However, the emphasis on transparency and the politics of SWFs risks missing a bigger policy issue: the recent rapid growth in SWFs reflects large and persistent global imbalances which are a continuing threat to the stability of the world financial system and the global economy.  11  Hedge Fund Working Group (2008), ""Hedge Fund Standards: Final Report"" and Walker Working Group (2007), ""Guidelines for Disclosure and Transparency in Private Equity"". The Large Report recommends a set of best practice standards for hedge funds in terms of disclosure, valuation, risk, governance and shareholder conduct. The Walker Report recommends a set of guidelines for disclosure and transparency by private equity funds, including the publication of regular information on their financing, ownership and prospects.  Global imbalances and financial crises  While there are many examples of countries which have run deficits for many years such as Australia and New Zealand, history also shows how painful the eventual adjustment can be. There are many examples in which capital flight has resulted in a huge fall in GDP growth and broader financial crises � for example in Latin America in the early 1980s, in the Nordic countries in the early 1990s and the east Asian economies a decade ago � which, in turn, weakened global GDP growth or global financial institutions.  Countries with large deficits are vulnerable to a rapid reversal of capital flows. If investors are no longer willing to finance the deficit, domestic spending will need to be cut relative to output through a combination of reducing spending and switching production to the tradable sector. A recent IMF study reviewed 42 episodes of large reductions in current account deficits in developed countries over the past 40 years. In a quarter of the cases, which were mainly countries with limited real exchange rate depreciation, annual GDP growth fell by 3� percentage points on average.12  There are dangers too for surplus countries. Large foreign exchange inflows are not easy to sterilise. They tend to contribute to asset price bubbles and higher inflation which itself can undermine economic and financial stability. The effect of such inflows into China and oil-exporting countries have been compounded recently by their exchange rates being pegged or managed against the falling dollar. This has contributed not just to the build up of reserves and SWFs but also to the build up of inflationary pressures within these countries.  No one would blame EMEs for the current turmoil in Western financial markets. It has been generated at home by the widespread mispricing of financial assets; this has been most obvious among the assets based on the US housing market but it is not confined to that sector. However the way that the boom developed did owe a great deal to global imbalances. 12  IMF (2007) �Exchange rates and the adjustment of external imbalances� IMF WEO April, Chapter 3.  The �savings glut�, to quote Ben Bernanke13, that developed in the oil exporting countries and China contributed to the fall in real long-term interest rates.14 In the UK, for example, real long-term interest rates, measured by the difference between the nominal 10-year government bond yield and the annual rate of inflation, fell from around 3.9% in 1997 to 1.6% in 2005. A similar pattern was also evident in the US (Chart 6). In particular, interest rates on safe assets fell since the build up in foreign assets were invested mainly in government bonds.15 That both discouraged saving and boosted asset prices. In order to maintain their traditional returns, the private sector sought higher yielding strategies and were too ready to believe that these could be attained through new products without running bigger risks. We are now dealing with the consequences of that mistake.  Global imbalances � where to from here The unwinding of global imbalances requires some combination of a slowdown in the growth of domestic demand in deficit countries and an increase in domestic demand in surplus countries. If the slowdown is not to dominate, we need to see a shift in relative prices to rebalance demand � that is a gradual real exchange rate depreciation of deficit countries against surplus ones.  The rise of SWFs may play a part in this dynamic. Their emergence is a sign that surplus countries may be less willing in future to accept such low yielding assets. That should put pressure on exchange rates to adjust and contribute to a reduction in global  13  Bernanke, B (2007) ""Global Imbalances: Recent Developments and Prospects"", speech delivered for the Bundesbank Lecture, Berlin, and Bernanke, B (2005) ""The Global Savings Glut and the U.S. Current Account Deficit"", speech delivered for the Sandridge Lecture at the Virginia Association of Economists.  14  A fall in desired investment (investment �strike�) in some countries also contributed to the decline in global real interest rates. For example, investment-GDP ratios fell sharply in the Newly Industrialised Countries in the wake of the east Asian crisis a decade ago.  15  For example FE Warnock and VC Warnock (2006) (�International Capital Flows and US interest rates�, NBER Working Paper, 12560) estimate that foreign official flows reduced US 10-year Treasury nominal yields by about 100 basis points lower than otherwise in the year to June 2005.  imbalances. So while SWFs may be a product of global imbalances, they may also play a part in the adjustment.  There are signs that in the United States, at least, imbalances are beginning to adjust. The US current account deficit now looks past its peak and the marked fall in the dollar � about 25% in real traded-weighted terms � since its peak in early 2002 should help in the adjustment. However, the decline in US relative demand is coming about mainly through slower domestic demand growth at home rather than faster demand growth abroad while the dollar has fallen less against currencies with the largest current account surpluses (Chart 7). There is a risk, therefore, that the fall in the US current deficit will not be matched by a fall of surpluses in high surplus countries but a rise in deficits in other deficit countries. The imbalances could be transferred not reduced.  So it is important that the current large gap between savings and investment in the Far East and oil exporting countries narrows. In the near term, the ability to increase spending will be constrained by the recent increase in inflationary pressures in these countries. But more exchange rate flexibility should be helpful on both fronts. And over the medium-term, in oil exporting countries, government spending is likely to increase further in response to past increases in incomes since part of the rise in the oil price looks to be permanent. This gives oil exporters the opportunity to spend more on diversifying production in their economies. It is encouraging also that in China the government has plans to increase its own expenditure on the infrastructure, encourage higher spending by households through speeding up financial sector reform and improving the safety net as well as allowing more flexibility than in the past in the exchange rate.  Conclusion  Given the growth of the foreign currency reserves in many EMEs, the emergence of SWFs making long term investments on financial criteria in a wider range of instruments is a positive development. Some increase in the transparency both of the strategy and objectives of the funds and of recipient countries� approach to inward  investment should help dispel concerns and ensure they are a force for greater global financial integration rather than a prompt for a new wave of financial protectionism. SWF�s recent investments in global financial institutions have been helpful in easing the current financial market turmoil. And the fact that they, and their central banks, are looking for higher returns and greater asset diversification should be beneficial both to the EMEs and to the recipient countries since it should improve the efficiency of global asset allocation.  But that positive story should not conceal that the growth of SWFs is also a result of persistent global imbalances in trade. These imbalances have helped create vulnerabilities in financial markets and in the wider economy.

More open and competitive financial systems have developed hand in hand with a recognition that the prime responsibility of central banks is to maintain price stability. To help them achieve that, more and more central banks around the world have been made independent of Government. The nature and extent of that independence varies from country to country, but in essence it is the freedom of either an individual Governor or a Monetary Policy Committee within the central bank to set interest rates free from political interference. That policy independence needs to be backed by organisational and financial independence which, in the case of the Bank of England, is entrusted to a Court of Directors of the Bank which decides on the budget and other relevant financial matters.  For those central banks with a long tradition of independence, their pre-existing frameworks of monetary policy have proved sufficient to enable them to bring inflation down and contribute to what has become known as the Great Stability. But in most of the countries whose central banks have been made independent more recently, policy has been based on an explicit inflation target. Inflation targeting has been the framework of choice for the past 20 years. It most clearly represents an explicit commitment by the central bank to the objective of price stability. In the United Kingdom, that commitment is in the form of a target for inflation that is defined as 2% a year, as measured by the consumer price index.  In the medium term, a central bank can affect only monetary values � the price level. It cannot change the amount of goods and services an economy is able to produce. Over time, there is no trade off between inflation and output, as recent UK history illustrates. Between 1950 and 1997, UK inflation averaged nearly 6%. In contrast, since 1997, inflation has been close to target and much more stable, but annual output growth has averaged a little above its post-World War II average of 2.5%. In the medium term, low and stable inflation does not imply lower output. Moreover, even in the short term, meeting an inflation target is in many cases fully consistent with 2  maintaining steady growth of activity. If demand falls below the supply capacity of the economy, inflation will tend to fall. If demand rises too quickly, putting pressure on capacity, inflation will tend to rise.  Inflation-targeting central banks can, however, face an apparent dilemma when inflation moves away from the target not as the result of fluctuations in demand, but in response to commodity price changes. Following increases in gas and electricity bills, consumer price inflation in the UK has risen. The central projection in our February Inflation Report is for it to rise further, to around 3%. That pronounced pickup stems from sharp rises in commodity prices around the world. Food prices on world markets are more than 50% higher, and oil prices two-thirds higher, than they were a year ago.  To some it might seem odd that an inflation targeting central bank has not tried to offset those inflationary pressures. That is because we operate �flexible� inflation targeting within a framework that recognises that it is not, in practice, always possible to keep inflation at target. The remit for our Monetary Policy Committee states that:  �The framework takes into account that any economy at some point can suffer from external events or temporary difficulties, often beyond its control. The framework is based on the recognition that the actual inflation rate will on occasions depart from its target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Attempts to keep inflation at the inflation target in these circumstances may cause undesirable volatility in output�.  The time lag between changes in interest rates and their impact on inflation means that the MPC can have little effect on the short-term path of inflation. What is crucial is that the pickup proves to be temporary, just as the rise in inflation last year was. As commodity prices stabilise, inflation will fall back towards our target next year. But that does not mean we can ignore the pickup in inflation that is now underway. In judging how far inflation is likely to fall back next year, we have to gauge the extent to which high inflation in the short term will enter the expectations of those setting prices and pay. If it does so, then without some margin of spare capacity, inflation will have some tendency to persist above the target.  3  Our inflation target is symmetric. We are not aiming for inflation below 2%, but at 2%. So even though some slowdown in the growth rate of economic activity is likely to be necessary to ensure that inflation returns to the target, we cannot allow the economy to slow too sharply, lest a margin of spare capacity is produced that pulls inflation down below the target next year. We face a difficult balancing act.  Why should we not focus on growth for a while and forget about inflation? The answer is that once higher inflation becomes entrenched, it may be costly to dislodge. Past UK recessions were associated not with slowdowns in the world economy, but with attempts to squeeze inflation out of the UK economy. The best thing that we can do to promote economic stability is to avoid inflation, and inflation expectations, from becoming dislodged from the target in the first place.  The most important function of an independent central bank is its role in monetary policy. Price stability is a necessary foundation of economic stability more generally. But central banks around the world are also called upon to engage, to a greater or lesser extent, in the supervision of financial institutions. Unlike monetary policy, where in large part a common framework prevails around the world, there is no uniformity in the roles played by central banks in the supervision of the financial system.  The supervision of financial institutions is sometimes regarded as part of the functions of a central bank and sometimes given to one or more other regulatory bodies. It is striking how varied are the arrangements in different countries. In the United Kingdom, an important ingredient in the 1997 reforms which took banking supervision away from the Bank of England and handed it to a single regulatory body, the Financial Services Authority, was the view that it was no longer sensible to try to distinguish commercial banks from investment banks, and banks from securities companies. A common regulatory framework was needed. There are, however, important differences between prudential supervision and �conduct� of business regulation, so some countries have adopted a �twin peaks� solution in which the central bank is responsible for prudential supervision and conduct of business regulation is given to a different body.  4  This is evidence that the appropriate division of responsibilities will depend on local circumstances. One of the most important of those is the number of institutions which merit supervision. In a country with a limited number of banks it is less clear that a separate supervisor is needed and the central bank may well be able to take this responsibility on without risk to its reputation or of other contagion to its primary monetary policy responsibilities. In contrast to monetary policy, where the appropriate institutional framework is common to all countries, there is unlikely to be uniformity in the roles played by central banks in the supervision of the financial system.  Regardless of where responsibility for regulation lies, it is hard to imagine taking steps either to prevent, or to deal with, the consequences of a financial crisis without the active involvement of the central bank. Central banks are currently at the heart of efforts to restore confidence in the banking system by the provision of liquidity against assets which have proved to be highly illiquid. But the recent challenges presented by the latest episode of financial turmoil suggest that much hard thought will need to be given to the structure and nature of banking regulation in the future. In the longer-term, it seems extremely likely that banks and other �near� banks, especially those that have been regarded as similar to banks in terms of their eligibility for financial assistance, will be called upon to hold more capital and a greater quantity of liquid assets than hitherto. It is too early to foresee clearly where the long-term direction will go. But serious thinking and a willingness to contemplate radical change will be necessary.  5
2008-04-20	"Monetary Policy and the Financial System Remarks given by Paul Tucker, Executive Director and Member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England  2 April 2008  1  All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx  2 INSTITUTIONAL MONEY MARKET FUNDS ASSOCIATION, 2 APRIL 2008  Alongside many others, the money market fund industry has for months now been grappling with turmoil and fragility across financial markets. It continues to pose serious challenges for all of us, and so I shall use this evening to summarise briefly a few of the strands in my own thinking about monetary policy and the financial system.  Monetary policy  First, monetary policy. The tightening of credit conditions domestically and internationally makes it likely that aggregate demand will slow, with a risk that it will slow considerably. There is, in consequence, a meaningful downwards threat to inflation over the medium term. Usually, the MPC would respond by cutting Bank Rate sufficiently to offset more or less entirely what we judged, over time, to be the impact of the tighter financial conditions on the path of spending, so as to ensure that aggregate demand remained broadly in line with the economy�s productive capacity. But conditions do not favour such a �business as usual� approach to demand management. That is because, alongside those downside risks to inflation, there are also upside risks to inflation over the medium term � and I am stressing �medium term� � stemming from the rise in commodity prices and the decline in sterling�s exchange rate. In the near term, CPI inflation is very likely to rise to materially above our 2% target. The question is whether that unavoidable temporary rise will remain just that, temporary; or whether it will feed into medium-term expectations of inflation, and so get reflected in wages and prices going forward and, thus, in domestically-generated inflation.  Given this unusual combination of significant downside and upside risks to the medium-term inflation outlook, the broad policy strategy is to offset some but not all of the adverse shock to demand from tighter credit conditions. And to do so by changing Bank Rate gradually and with transparency about that broad strategy. To be clear, this approach probably means allowing a degree of slack to develop in the economy, in the interests of avoiding taking risks with inflation on the upside. Only by underpinning the credibility of the nominal anchor provided by the MPC�s commitment to the inflation target will we maintain scope to cushion the real economy from the effects of the stresses in the international financial system. If we implement this strategy successfully, we will be able to provide more durable support for demand and activity.  MKTS_DOCS:248304v1  3 If, by contrast, we were to adopt a course that let the inflation genie out of the bottle, we would find ourselves needing to tighten policy, exacerbating the slowdown in activity.  That broad strategy is not a recipe for inaction. The central projection in February�s Inflation Report was for inflation to return to close to the 2% target over the coming two to three years, conditional on the market�s expectation of further cuts in Bank Rate. But nor does the strategy determine a definite path for Bank Rate over the coming months. Each of us on the MPC must form a judgment month by month on which of the risks to the inflation outlook � from financial conditions or from rising costs � is proving more potent, and so a judgment on the degree to which we can set a course that underpins demand.  Since the February Inflation Report, oil prices are around 10% higher, and sterling�s exchange rate around 4% lower, so the immediate cost pressures are worse. The good news is that, in the labour market, nominal earnings growth has so far remained subdued, notwithstanding the rise in near-term inflation expectations revealed by a range of surveys. This is perhaps suggestive of the adjustment in real take-home pay made necessary by the sharp increase in firms� costs due to the further rises in commodity prices. In manufacturing, firms� input costs have risen sharply over the past twelve months; and output price inflation has reached nearly 6%. A big question is to what extent competition amongst retailers will dampen the pass through into retail prices. Anecdotally, retailers still sound as though they are competing fiercely on prices, and driving down other costs in order to maintain their margins.  Meanwhile, on the other side of the ledger, many essentially backward-looking indicators of UK real demand and activity have held up reasonably well. But we should not yet place great weight on that. It can sometimes take time for disturbances to affect real economic activity. In the United States, arguably there was quite a lag between the onset of problems in housing finance and the pass through to spending. The UK looks to be quite a lot better than the US. The latest data for Q4 last year did, however, suggest that household spending on durables slowed quite significantly. And we are seeing softening in consumer confidence and property market conditions. So the picture on the real economy is mixed.  What is clear is that credit conditions are unambiguously tighter than two months ago, underlining that source of downside risk to the outlook for demand and inflation. In retail lending markets, banks have raised the interest rates charged (relative to Bank Rate) on new MKTS_DOCS:248304v1  4 lending, but they have all been doing much the same and many borrowers seem to have been willing to pay the extra. In consequence, banks generally may not have achieved their desired conservation of balance sheet capacity, and we are now seeing the withdrawal of some lending products.  And in wholesale markets, the spread between the price that the banks themselves pay for funds, roughly LIBOR, and the expected central bank policy rate has, again, widened significantly over the past couple of months across the major international markets. Many financial contracts are linked closely to three-month LIBOR so, other things being equal, the increase in money market spreads has the effect of reducing the level of Bank Rate consistent with unchanged monetary conditions.  At the Committee�s March meeting, I judged that an immediate further cut, following February�s, might very easily have been misunderstood as a change of strategy away from the one focused on the medium-term outlook for inflation that I have spelled out this evening. My own vote at the April meeting will depend on all the data, some of it still to reach us, since then.  Financial system deleveraging: legacy portfolios  Whatever path monetary policy takes in the UK in the months ahead, it is clear that the process of deleveraging in the financial system is not complete. Some asset prices embody a hefty discount for the current illiquidity in markets, which feeds into the accounting measure of financial firms� capitalisation, and so into perceptions of counterparty credit risk and money market conditions. In consequence, there remains a risk that credit creation � the lubricant that the financial system provides to the real economy � will be further impaired. Several features of our financial system lie behind this, and I want to touch on just a few of them.  Financial markets have swung from a prolonged period of underpricing risk to now plausibly overpricing risk on at least some products. And yet, one might think perversely, we have also swung from an over abundant supply of credit to a much more restrictive supply of new credit. The global insurance industry provides an interesting contrast with banking in this respect. For sure, it too is capable of systematically misjudging risks. But when a shift in risk appreciation and pricing occurs, the reinsurance industry often separates the run off of old portfolios containing mispriced contracts from the establishment of new vehicles, capitalised separately to MKTS_DOCS:248304v1  5 take advantage of attractive terms on new business. And for regular insurance, many contracts are annual, so adversely priced business can run off fairly quickly. Banking typically works quite differently. Banks around the world are carrying portfolios of term loans that are the legacy of the boom years. There is uncertainty � amongst banks� management, shareholders and funders � about the degree of fundamental impairment in those portfolios. New loans are booked to the same balance sheets. And so many banks face a choice between, on the one hand, conserving capital and liquidity to support legacy portfolios; and, on the other hand, deploying capital and liquidity to write new business on what some see as the attractive terms and conditions now available. The banking system simply is not structured routinely to insulate new business from the legacy of past mistakes; funding and capital are fungible.  This predicament may be exacerbated by other features of the current environment.  One is an apparent reluctance on the part of banks to raise fresh capital except where the market thinks that it is beyond doubt that they need to do so. Given the feedback from credit conditions to asset prices and the real economy and so potentially to banks� future earnings, it might seem slightly odd for banks internationally to be maintaining distributions to shareholders but tightening credit availability in order to preserve resources. This has to be seen in the wider context.  One possible explanation for banks holding back from raising fresh capital is that they may want to avoid giving an adverse signal about themselves. If there is a co-ordination problem, the regulatory authorities internationally should be able to tackle it, allied to ensuring prudent valuations of legacy portfolios. But another possible explanation is that, like some other market participants, bankers may believe that many legacy assets are fundamentally undervalued at present and that the markets for securitised assets will, with time, recover and reopen. On that view, banks are avoiding becoming overcapitalised on a fundamentals (or forward looking) basis, and so setting off another expansionary phase in the credit cycle, a little further down the road. The serious puzzle which that underlines is why there is a dearth of buyers for the supposedly undervalued paper. With the terms and availability of financing from banks and dealers having tightened, levered funds are hardly likely to be the US Cavalry. But it is interesting that there has not been more interest from investment institutions with ostensibly long holding periods, which are largely unlevered and are not exposed to liquidity risk from borrowing short and lending long. What we commonly hear from contacts is that investment MKTS_DOCS:248304v1  6 managers do not want to be caught out if asset prices fall further before they recover. But no one can seriously believe that they can spot the bottom of the market, and short-term horizons should not weigh heavily in longer-term investment institutions. All of which suggests that there may be structural impediments. Those could include some combination of the reasonable difficulty that some asset managers experience in assessing the quality of securitised assets; and mandates and accounting policies that may have the effect of shortening asset managers� time horizons.  The challenge for your own industry seems to have been slightly different. The managers of some money funds around the world, although I am sure not all of your members, joined in the �search for yield� by going down the credit spectrum and increasing maturity mismatch during the boom in credit markets. As those funds have moved back towards home base, shortening the maturity and increasing the liquidity of their assets, one effect has been a reduction in the net supply of term funding into the international banking system.  That has been one of many contributors to the liquidity strains evident in money markets. But those strains have also been exacerbated by an unexpected breakdown in the technology for liquidity insurance provided by central banks.  For well over a century, throughout the industrialised world there has in effect been something akin to a Social Contract between the banking system and the authorities. The banking system is permitted to profit from undertaking leveraged maturity transformation in the course of intermediating the liquid savings of depositors into illiquid loans to households, firms and others. In doing so, commercial banks provide liquidity insurance, whether via demand deposits or committed lines of credit. They can do this because their deposit liabilities are money, which puts them at the heart of the payments system and is what makes them special; banks are at the heart of a monetary economy. In return, the authorities respond with a combination of prudential supervision, to contain the risks that banks run; deposit insurance, to protect savers; and liquidity insurance from the central bank. Smaller commercial banks can try to buy liquidity insurance from their larger brethren. Large banks cannot realistically do the same. They need to hold liquid assets. But there is no cast iron guarantee that asset markets will remain liquid in all conditions. So since Bagehot�s day, central banks have stood ready to provide unlimited liquidity against good collateral at a rate that is higher than the normal market rate. However, during the period of turmoil since last summer it has proved toxic, here and overseas, for banks to access liquidity on those terms from central banks unless in broad and quality company. That MKTS_DOCS:248304v1  7 has created uncertainty about the access of banks to the central banks in practice, and has required innovation and clear assurances from the central banking community. This alone will require reforms to the way in which central banks use their balance sheets, and money creating power, to sustain financial stability.  Banks will also need to adapt. It seems that at not a few firms, the discipline of risk management somehow got separated from that of balance sheet management (or funding). It was effectively assumed that financing markets would remain open come what may. There is a question of whether treasury management should somehow be insulated from the pressures of a profit centre. Separately, assumptions were made about relationships between asset prices that have proved groundless. One such is the spread between term money market rates and expected central bank policy rates. So long as the so-called LIBOR/Overnight Index Swap spread was narrow at all maturities, few market participants cared about whether they hedged against a LIBOR-based instrument when in fact sometimes they really needed a hedge relative to a risk-free rate. We sense that some international fixed-income asset managers would like there to be OIS-based contracts alongside LIBOR-based financial contracts, so that they can tailor their hedges more precisely. There should be wider benefits from contracts based purely on the risk-free rate rather than embodying liquidity premia and credit-risk premia of various kinds. That is something for the industry.  But better liquidity-insurance technology and better risk management will not abolish the credit cycle. Looking further ahead, the big question will be whether the authorities can tame the credit cycle without sacrificing the incentives to enterprise that are so important in a dynamic economy. The debate about the micro regulation of banks will need to take account of whether or not we can deliver that macroprudential objective. For too long, the debate has got sidetracked. Into whether we can rely on monetary policy �mopping up� after bubbles burst. Or into whether monetary policy could be used to control asset prices as well as doing its orthodox job of steering nominal trends in the economy, which I should say can include taking account of prospective risks of inflation volatility over the medium term. Ideas circulating already include minimum margin requirements or capital ratios that vary not only across instruments or firms but also through time as credit conditions change. We need calmly to explore whether there are also other possibilities. But let me make this absolutely clear: there are formidable obstacles to finding a solution. In the monetary sphere, a regime of floating exchange rates allows individual countries to pursue their own domestic monetary objectives. But in a world in which capital MKTS_DOCS:248304v1  8 flows freely, local attempts to control the pace of credit creation, particularly within the financial system, may not work. All of that will need to be thought through. But first we need to concentrate on the immediate challenges.  Summary  In a speech four months ago, I stressed that �we must try to avoid a vicious circle in which tighter liquidity conditions, lower asset values, impaired capital resources, reduced credit supply, and slower aggregate demand feed back on each other�. I identified monetary policy, liquidity policy, and regulatory capital policy as being amongst the instruments the authorities would need to use. That remains the case, as the stress in the global financial system has continued and, in the US at least, evidence of a feedback loop is apparent. Each of those instruments is constrained in some degree. That underlines the need for close co-operation between the authorities and the industry, and internationally.  MKTS_DOCS:248304v1"
2008-06-21	"How Big is the Risk of Recession? Speech given by Andrew Sentence, Member of the Monetary Policy Committee, Bank of England  21 February 2008  I would like to thank Andrew Holder for research assistance and invaluable advice. I am also grateful for helpful comments from other colleagues. The views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Bank of England or other members of the Monetary Policy Committee. 1  All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx  2 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am delighted to be addressing this business audience in the South West of England today. I have spent most of my career working as an economist in the world of business. So as a member of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), I have been very keen to take the opportunity to get out of London and visit companies and business groups around the UK � to make sure I am in touch with business conditions throughout the country. The feedback we gather from business at the grass-roots level � through business surveys, the Bank�s Agency network and visits like this � are an extremely valuable source of information and provide an essential input to the work that we do on the MPC.  This direct feedback from business is likely to be particularly useful at present. The UK economy has recently passed a turning point in the economic cycle. After a period of strong growth going back to early 2006, the pace of activity is beginning to slow. The Bank of England Agents� reports, the main business surveys and the data from the Office of National Statistics all point to some weakening in growth starting in the second half of last year. There has also been a softening in the global economy � albeit from a strong rate of growth � particularly in the US. The forward-looking indicators suggest we should expect some further slowing � both globally and in the UK � in first half of 2008.  Having passed a cyclical turning point, this raises the issue of how pronounced the cycle will be. Our experience since the early 1990s is that cycles in the UK have been mild. In the last decade and a half, annual GDP growth has fluctuated between just below 2% and just over 4% � a much smaller margin of variation than we had become accustomed to in the 1970s and 1980s.1 As Chart 1 shows, this has certainly been the most stable period of growth we have seen in the UK over the post-war period. And data on economic growth going back to the nineteenth century suggests it is probably the most stable period of economic growth in our history as an industrial nation.  1  The latest available estimates are that real GDP at market prices grew by 4.3% in 1994 and by 1.8% in 2005. In contrast, taking the period from 1970, GDP grew by 7.1% in 1973 and fell by 2.1% in 1980 � almost four times the recent range of fluctuation in growth rates.  3 Chart 1: GDP growth since 1950 Per cent 8 6 4 2 0 -2 -4 1950  1960  1970  1980  1990  2000  Source: Office for National Statistics  But we cannot guarantee that this steadier pattern of growth can continue into the future. When the economy is close to a turning point, it is particularly difficult to predict the future course of the cycle. We need to remember that the recent period of stability in economic growth was preceded by a particularly volatile period for the UK economy � from the early 1970s through to the early 1990s � including three major recessions. Some commentators have begun to talk about a UK recession again, raising the spectre of a return to that era.  That would be a worrying prospect, and in my judgement an outright recession � in which economic activity falls year-on-year � is a remote risk for the UK economy at present.2 But we should expect to see a significant slowdown in growth. And there remains a lot of uncertainty about how pronounced and prolonged this will be.  Later on in this speech, I will return to the current conjuncture. But to set my assessment in context, I will first look in more detail at the UK economic cycle. What are the forces driving the cycle in the UK economy? And how do we account for the relative stability of the UK economy over the last decade and a half, after the volatility of the preceding two decades? 2  Some commentators use a technical definition of recession which originated in the United States � two successive quarters of falling GDP. However, quarterly growth rates can be volatile and are subject to measurement error. In my view, a better definition is a fall in GDP year-on-year, which is what we observed in the three post-war UK recessions of the mid-70s, early-80s and early-90s.  4 The economic cycle  The economic cycle reflects the fact that economic growth is not a totally linear and predictable process. In fact, when we consider that the growth of the UK economy is the outcome of the consumption decisions which take place in 25 million households, interacting with the production and investment decisions of 4� million business enterprises,3 it is perhaps amazing that economic growth is as steady as it is!  We observe economic cycles because demand � or spending � fluctuates relative to the underlying capacity of the economy. When demand changes, companies respond to the fluctuating level of spending by gearing up or scaling down their production of goods and services, which is measured across the economy as a change in GDP.  Chart 2: Components of final demand  Exports  Consumption Government  Investment  Note: Chart shows composition of Total Final Expenditure at current prices in 2006. Source: Office for National Statistics  But what causes these swings in demand? As Chart 2 shows, there are four main components of spending: household consumption; investment � of which the largest component is business investment; government current expenditure; and exports. 3  The number of households is the latest estimate by the Office of National Statistics and the number of businesses is the latest estimate from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. Over 99% of these businesses are small enterprises with fewer than 50 employees. The 6,000 large enterprises, with 250 or more employees, account for 0.1% of enterprises but 41% of total employment and 48% of total turnover.  5 Because consumer spending is the largest single component, changes in consumption are always an important factor shaping the economic cycle. But some of the other components of spending � in particular investment and exports � �punch above their weight� in driving the cycle because they are much more volatile, as Chart 3 shows.  Chart 3: Investment and export growth Per cent 20  Investment  15  Exports 10 5  GDP 0 -5 -10 1960  1970  1980  1990  2000  Source: Office for National Statistics  However, significant swings in demand are not normally the product of one single demand component � they tend to be much more broadly based. This is partly because a slowdown or acceleration in spending triggered by changes in investment or exports can have second-round effects on consumption by affecting employment and wage growth, and hence household incomes. This is the �multiplier effect� which was a key element of Keynes� General Theory.4  Another reason why significant swings in demand tend to be broadly based is that a sustained period of strong growth or a marked slowdown does not normally reflect one single cause operating in isolation, but is usually the product of a combination of factors operating together. For example, oil price shocks played an important role in triggering the recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s. But it was not the only factor at work. Both recessions were preceded by periods of strong growth and a build-up of domestic inflationary pressures. In the early 1980s, the adjustment of the 4  See Keynes (1936).  6 exchange rate to the removal of exchange controls and the build-up of North Sea oil production also played a part. A significant demand shift is more likely if there are a number of factors at work rather than just a single shock.  In addition, some of the big shocks which have affected demand in the UK economy in past decades have also had similar effects on demand in other countries. When this happens the impact on domestic spending can be amplified by changing conditions in export markets. Weak export performance has played a part in all the three major UK recessions, and periods of healthy UK economic growth have often been associated with strong world demand.  When I was at the CBI in the late 1980s and early 1990s, I was conscious of how disruptive the volatility of the UK cycle had become to the British business community. From 1970 until the mid-1990s, the UK had the most volatile economic cycle of any major economy.5 Large swings in the economic cycle create difficulty for long-term business planning and investment, and have other adverse effects on the efficient functioning of the market economy.  The big swings in demand which are so troublesome for business can also create problems for monetary authorities like the MPC.  If demand and output get  significantly out of line with the underlying capacity of the economy, there will be consequences for inflation.  A prolonged period of strong growth will create  overheating and exert upward pressure on prices and costs across the economy. A period of very weak growth or recession exerts pressure in the opposite direction. To keep inflation on target, which is the remit of the MPC, it normally helps to avoid these large swings and keep spending and output in line with the underlying capacity of the economy.6  5  See Currie and Sentance (1994) for a detailed discussion of the UK cycle relative to other economies in the 1970s and 1980s and the reasons for excessive volatility. 6 The concept of the �output gap� aims to measure deviation of output and demand from underlying capacity, and is important to the New Keynesian framework for analysing monetary policy and the business cycle popularised by Woodford (2003). Nelson and Nikolov (2002) relate this framework to the UK and conclude that inaccurate estimates of the degree of excess demand in the UK economy contributed significantly to outbreaks of inflation in the 1960s and 1970s.  7 Managing the shocks and uncertainties  Managing the economy to stabilise inflation when a wide range of factors are causing demand to fluctuate is a major challenge for the MPC and other monetary authorities. We could imagine a world where the monetary authorities, with perfect information and perfect foresight, act to set interest rates to keep demand exactly in line with the supply potential of the economy and hence inflation is always in line with the target. That is certainly a world which MPC members might dream about. But the real world we inhabit in our waking hours differs from this dream-world of monetary perfection in three important respects.  First, we are not perfect forecasters with complete information. There is always uncertainty about the future level of demand and also about the supply potential of the economy. And because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, we could not fine tune the economy to eliminate all fluctuations in demand even if we wanted to. The real world also has a nasty habit of generating unusual shocks � such as the recent disruption to financial markets � which can be very hard to quantify and assess. That task is made even harder when we face a combination of shocks � as we currently do from both financial markets and food and energy markets. In the face of these shocks, the uncertainty around our projections of future demand will inevitably increase.  Second, when it comes to inflation, demand shocks are not the only thing we need to worry about. There can be other shocks to the inflation process in the economy which the monetary authorities need to take into account in setting interest rates. In the months ahead, we are expecting quite a bit of upward pressure on UK inflation from rising energy and food prices.  The recent decline in sterling may add to these  pressures by pushing up import prices more generally. While the MPC cannot do much about the short-term impact of these movements in commodity and currency markets, our interest rate policy does need to take into account the need to ensure that they do not have a sustained impact on inflation in the medium term. A headwind of slower growth of output and demand can be helpful in achieving that. By slowing the pass-through of costs into consumer prices and creating a margin of spare capacity, slower growth reduces the risk that a temporary rise in inflation will become more  8 deeply embedded through its impact on wage growth and price expectations more generally.  Third, the economy can be affected by price changes or shifts in demand or supply conditions which require significant real adjustments to the structure of the economy. These adjustments do not always occur smoothly and seamlessly.  In the early  twentieth century, the economist Joseph Schumpeter argued that economic cycles were strongly associated with a process of �creative destruction� in which older and more established firms decline and release resources for the growth of their innovative and entrepreneurial successors.7 This has certainly happened in the past in the UK. For example, the early 1980s recession saw a great deal of structural change in the UK�s manufacturing base, and the subsequent recovery was strongly driven by services industries.  One such structural change which may now be beginning to take place is the �rebalancing� of the UK economy, away from the strongly consumer-led growth of the late 1990s and the first half of this decade, and towards a pattern of growth where investment and exports make a bigger contribution.  A number of recent  developments could be working together to produce this shift in the pattern of growth, including the recent fall in sterling and high real energy prices � which will squeeze real incomes if sustained. A more restrained approach to lending to consumers and for property investment following the recent financial market turmoil may also play a part. Consistent with this, some of the clearest signs of slowdown in the UK economy at present relate to consumer spending and property markets.  Stabilising forces  Monetary policy operates in a world where these shocks, uncertainties and structural shifts play a major part in shaping economic developments. When a number of these factors are operating together, as they appear to be at present, it is not surprising that the road ahead for the economy appears rather bumpy and uncertain. 7  Schumpeter�s views on the role of entrepreneurship and innovation in economic development evolved over the course of his writings. Schumpeter (1939) and (1942) are probably two of his most important contributions.  9 However, while we appear to be set for a pronounced slowdown in the economy over the year ahead, a recession of the type we saw in the mid-70s, the early 80s and the early 90s does not appear to be on the cards. There are three associated differences from that era which mean we are much better placed now to manage the shocks and uncertainties we currently face.  First, and crucially, inflation expectations are much better anchored now than they were through the 1970s and 1980s.8 Chart 4 shows that the three big post-war recessions started from a position of much higher, persistent and volatile inflation than we now see. The need to get on top of inflationary pressures and subdue high and unstable inflation expectations contributed greatly to the length and depth of these recessions.  Chart 4: UK inflation from 1970 Per cent 25  Shaded areas mark periods when GDP fell on a year earlier  20  15  10  5  0 1970  1975  1980  1985  1990  1995  2000  2005  Note: Series shown is annual growth in consumer expenditure deflator, which moves closely with CPI and has a long, consistent time series available. Source: Office for National Statistics  By contrast, households and firms in the UK have now experienced a decade and a half of low and stable inflation, making it less likely that temporary fluctuations in inflation will trigger a wage-price spiral. The stability of wage settlements and earnings growth gives some confidence that this pattern of behaviour is not changing 8  Bank of England (2007) discusses the importance of reduced inflation expectations to the greater stability experienced since the early 1990s, as well as other potential contributory factors � good policy, good luck or other factors such as structural changes.  10 fundamentally, though there are risks suggested by rising measures of short-term inflation expectations which the MPC will need to monitor closely.  An important factor helping to anchor inflation expectations is that the current framework for monetary policy � based on an explicit inflation target and with a strong institutional underpinning � is now much more robust and stable. By contrast, the three major post-war recessions occurred against a background of policy instability and experimentation and at times there was no discernable monetary framework at all! In that environment, it was much easier to make policy mistakes which aggravated the boom-bust tendency of the economy � such as the Barber boom of 1973 and the Lawson boom of the late 1980s.  The third key difference from the bad old days of boom and bust is that the UK economy has now become more flexible in the face of shocks, particularly in the way the labour market operates.  Improved labour market performance has reflected  factors such as a reduction in union density and less adversarial industrial relations, accompanied by welfare reforms that have increased the relative rewards for working. More recently, migration has added significantly to the potential labour supply available to employers in the UK.9 As a result of these changes, it is now more likely that real wages will adjust to offset  adverse economic shocks, making big  adjustments to the level of employment less likely.  Structural changes to other areas of the UK economy may have contributed to greater macroeconomic stability. These include more efficient financial markets, and more flexible business practices such as improved inventory management, greater use of outsourcing and more flexible working patterns. The UK economy has also benefited from other favourable influences from changes in the global economy, including the impact of globalisation on UK import prices, though some of these changes may turn out be more transient.10  9  See Nickell and Quintini (2002) for further discussion of how changes in the 1980s and 1990s increased labour market flexibility. For an analysis of the impact of inward migration on UK labour markets, see Blanchflower, Saleheen and Shadforth (2007). 10 See Sentance (2007) for a discussion of the recent impact of changes in the global economy on UK inflation.  11 Policy challenges  Having said all that, monetary policy faces some big challenges at present, as the Bank�s latest Inflation Report made clear last week. First, the scale of the demand shock from the recent financial turbulence is still unclear. Second, we face significant short-term inflationary pressures from energy and food prices, possibly reinforced by the effect of a weaker pound on import prices more generally.  And third, the  economy faces a process of rebalancing and structural adjustment towards a pattern of growth less dependent on the consumer and more dependent on other sources of demand.  The MPC faces the significant challenge of setting the right course for monetary policy against this background. We should not underestimate the economic cycle. It has been around since Biblical times. When Joseph interpreted Pharaoh�s dream, as recorded in Genesis chapter 41, he predicted seven good years followed by seven lean years � the earliest record as far as I can see of an economic forecast, and one which proved remarkably accurate!  That is not what I expect for the UK economy in the years ahead, you will be pleased to hear! But I do expect the process of adjustment in the economy to result in a slowdown in growth, which may be more significant and sustained than we have seen in the recent past during the era of inflation targets and central bank independence. As with all cycles, that slowdown will be more noticeable in some sectors than others. Activities more dependent on the UK consumer and with strong links to property and financial markets may see a more marked change in demand. By contrast, UK manufacturing and other sectors more dependent on overseas markets will see an offsetting benefit from a more competitive pound, and could also find that the strength of demand in emerging markets helps to soften the impact of slower global growth in the US and Europe.  Monetary policy is a flexible tool, and the MPC meets every month to assess development and decide if a change is needed. In past, less turbulent, times there have been suggestions we should meet less frequently � like the Fed, which meets eight times a year. In my view, the current situation highlights the benefit of a  12 monthly cycle of meetings. At each meeting, we will be updating our assessment as new data come in.  And the information businesses provide � through business  surveys and the Agency network � will be a vital part of that assessment.  The future course of interest rates will depend very much on what that data flow � relating to global developments as well as the UK economy � tells us about the likely outlook for inflation. Is the actual and prospective slowing in the economy sufficient to keep inflation on target? Are we in danger of a sharper slowdown than is needed? Or have we underestimated the upside risks to inflation � particularly through inflation expectations? We will be continually updating our assessment on these questions at each monthly meeting in the light of the available evidence.  Our mandate is to keep inflation on target.  The experience over the period of  inflation targeting in the UK is that this has resulted in a more damped economic cycle. Though we cannot guarantee that will always be the case, there are good reasons why we should not see a return to the excessive volatility of earlier decades. We do now have a strong and robust framework for monetary policy, inflation expectations appear reasonably well anchored, and the UK economy has shown itself to be much more flexible in the face of shocks than in earlier decades. The economic road may be getting bumpier, and there may be some unpredictable obstacles ahead, but keeping our focus on achieving low and stable inflation over the medium term is our best guide to steering the right course.  13 References: Bank of England (2007), �The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England: ten years on�, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Q1, pages 24-38.

2008-10-28	"Rebuilding Confidence in the Financial System Speech given by Sir John Gieve, Deputy Governor, Bank of England At the BBA�s 12th Annual Supervision Conference 28 October 2008  1  All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx  We are publishing today our bi-annual Financial Stability Report, and so I want to start my presentation by looking at the wider context of the debate on supervision, on which this conference is focusing. The word unprecedented is used too frequently. But the instability in financial markets over the last year � culminating in the seizure of money markets in recent weeks (Chart 1) � has been the most severe in living memory. It did not come out of the blue. The price of risk especially in credit markets had fallen to unsustainable levels by summer 2007 and many banks and other institutions had become reliant on sustained liquidity in new markets which had never had been tested by a downturn. In the July 2006 FSR, for example the Bank warned of �UK banks� increasing dependence on wholesale funding� and, in April 2007, we noted that: �if UK banks were unable to securitise existing assets, new lending would need to be financed through other wholesale sources, which may be difficult or costly to access during times of stress.� So it proved. But the Bank was not alone in pointing to the vulnerabilities in the financial system in 2006 and 2007. Other commentators and authorities gave similar warnings. And many market participants were also expecting a correction at some point; but they generally felt they were well placed to handle it. In fact the severity and breadth of the downswing has surprised markets, commentators, and policymakers alike. In the light of subsequent developments, a number of commentators have concluded that the problem was simply a lack of attention and short memories. I don�t think it was quite as simple as that. I am with Mark Twain who said ""History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme."" While the current crisis has some similarities to previous downswings � in the early 90s or of the 70s for example - there are some significant differences too. For example the last three recessions in the UK (in the 70s, 80s and early 90s) were preceded by sharp rises in consumption and activity and earnings to well above sustainable rates. As Chart 2 shows that was not true of the last few years when consumption, output and earnings all seemed unusually stable. Again in previous recessions, stress in the banking sector has tended to follow on from defaults and losses on domestic loans as interest rates rise and the economy slows down. But this time the downturn started in the banking sector - last summer when losses in the US property market not only led to losses in UK banks trading and 2  treasury books but closed important sources of finance to them. The downturn in the housing market and then the wider economy followed. Domestic default rates, while beginning to rise, are still low by historical standards, despite the fact that we are more than a year into the crisis. Those differences reflect the most important distinguishing feature of this downturn, namely its roots in global imbalances not just in trade but in the financial system. The growth and savings in emerging economies led to an extraordinary flow of funds back to the developed world and to the US in particular. That in turn kept interest rates low, allowing the rapid growth of credit and fuelling a sharp rise in asset prices and an increasingly risky search for yield � for example in sub prime housing in the US. The impact in the UK was different but no less marked. Here too the low cost of credit fuelled a spectacular expansion of bank balance sheets (Chart 3) and with it a growth in leverage (Chart 4). And, as Chart 5 shows, while savings rates fell in the UK, limiting the growth of retail deposits, banks financed that lending by tapping wholesale markets. The gap between customer lending and deposits moved from zero at the turn of the century to over �700 billion in 2008 H1. Much of that funding was ultimately sourced overseas. In particular, the United States acted as an intermediary, attracting capital inflows from the rest of the world and exporting these funds to other countries. Road shows to investors in the US and Europe ceased to be the preserve of the international giants and became common among smaller players whose whole asset base was in the UK. As the difficulties in the financial system have persisted and worsened, it has become clear that these developments have created real structural weaknesses in the banking sector. In particular: � inflated aggregate balance sheets, whose expansion had outpaced growth in the real economy; � expansion into assets whose underlying value, credit quality and liquidity were uncertain; � liability structures which were overly reliant on sustained availability of wholesale funding whose maturity was often short;  3  � capital and liquidity buffers which became too low , given these asset and liability risks; and � underappreciated, but potent interconnections between firms in the global financial system. Policy response For most of the last year, the Bank has adopted a twin track approach, as part of the Tripartite partnership with the FSA and the Treasury. The first track has been to provide liquidity to the market in order to give most banks time to make the necessary adjustments � including by raising capital. That has involved an increasing range of measures including long term repos on a wide range of collateral and the introduction of the Special Liquidity Scheme which allows banks to swap illiquid assets for Treasury Bills for periods of up to three years. The recent dollar swaps and further extensions of the SLS and eligible collateral are further steps in that direction. And we recently announced a more permanent structure of money market operations including the introduction of a discount window. The second track has been to work closely with the FSA and Treasury to limit the repercussions from the failure of banks which do not have an independent future whether through arranging mergers or managing closure. Northern Rock was the first in line and led to a lot of criticism of the tripartite. I think we have learned a great deal over the year and have shown more skill and speed with subsequent cases including Bradford and Bingley recently. But in the last 6 weeks it became clear that this case by case approach was not enough either at home or internationally. Despite the provision of additional liquidity to the system, market conditions got worse over the summer as worries grew about the downturn in the broader economy and its consequences for bank losses. Once again the triggers for a further downward lurch came in the US. First Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken into conservatorship and then, the following weekend, Lehman Brothers proved unable to find a buyer and filed for bankruptcy. That shook markets which had expected it to be saved by the State, if necessary, as had been the case with Bear Stearns earlier in the year. Within a day, AIG had to be rescued following rumours about the size of its losses on CDS contracts and pressures grew on the remaining securities dealers. Later in the  4  week, Secretary Paulson announced his initial $700 billion plan to purchase assets to support the banking sector. It didn�t entirely still the doubts. The pressures were also felt in Europe. At the end of September Dexia, Fortis and Hypo Real Estate all had to receive emergency capital injections, mostly government supplied. In the UK the authorities facilitated a rapid consolidation in the mortgage sector with Abbey Santander buying Alliance and Leicester, some mergers in the building society sector, and the proposed merger of LTSB and HBOS. Finally, in late September the Tripartite authorities intervened to resolve growing difficulties in Bradford and Bingley by transferring the deposits and branch network to Abbey Santander and taking the remaining assets and liabilities into public ownership for orderly wind down. But the loss of confidence went wider than a subset of vulnerable banks. Our report estimates the total US and European marked to market losses on credit assets at nearly $2.8 trillion. While these will not all fall on banks and may exaggerate the losses to those who can hold debt to maturity, investors and counterparties became worried about the extent of the likely losses on banking and trading books in a wider range of institutions and in their ability to continue to finance their businesses. The focus of their concerns shifted from future profitability to future survival. CDS premia rose to unprecedented levels (Chart 6), bank equity prices fell sharply and the money markets seized up. Interbank lending spreads widened dramatically (Chart 7) and lending became almost entirely concentrated in the overnight market. The shortening of interbank maturities generated a dangerous �snowball� effect as maturing term funding had to be rolled overnight. It was to tackle that wider loss of confidence that the UK authorities announced on 8th of October its comprehensive package of support for recapitalisation, guaranteed funding and enhanced liquidity. It was designed to remove solvency fears by ensuring that banks had more than sufficient capital to survive a severe economic downturn and thus to enable them to continue to lend on normal criteria to good credits. The new capital and the government guaranteed borrowing and liquidity support was designed to ensure and be seen to ensure that banks would be able to sustain their businesses through a downturn. With the banking system fully solvent, guarantees could be extended without exposing taxpayer to unacceptable risks. In a remarkable show of international consensus, a similar approach was quickly adopted by many other countries both in the US and EU and more widely. 5  Looking ahead The early signs suggest that the package is underpinning the banking system both directly and as a demonstration of the authorities� determination to do whatever is needed to re-establish confidence. In particular CDS premia for banks have fallen markedly (Chart 6) since the package was announced. And progress on guarantees, while gradual, has also been encouraging, with a number of banks issuing bonds even without the use of the guarantee. Libor spreads have also edged down and are now expected to fall a bit further and faster than before the package (Chart 8). Many banks continue to face a period of deleveraging and rebalancing to reduce their dependence on Central Bank finance and on short term wholesale funding. However a stronger capital and financing position will make it possible for them to do that over a period of some years, which will diminish the squeeze on lending in the short run. More widely, of course, the financial system remains under acute strain. The falls in equity markets, corporate bond prices and the prices for leveraged loans is hitting both long term institutional investors and leveraged investors, including hedge funds. Some are being forced to sell into a falling market in response to margin calls and redemptions. And there are growing signs of stress in many emerging market economies. We have already seen a banking sector and currency crisis in Iceland and in the past few days the IMF has also announced loan packages for the Ukraine and Hungary. In short, the package of measures introduced in the UK and elsewhere has improved the prospects significantly, especially for banks but it is too soon to declare the crisis over. Authorities worldwide need to remain vigilant and to be ready to step in again if necessary. The medium term agenda We all have lessons to learn from the turmoil of the last fifteen months. I would like to pick out three in particular, two of which are international and one UK specific: � the need to develop new �macro prudential� policies to bridge the gap between monetary policy and the regulation of particular institutions and markets; � the need to establish a more effective regime in the UK for handling failing banks; and 6  �  the need to improve the handling of cross border crises and bank failures.  Central Banks have always paid close attention to asset prices and credit growth in deciding monetary policy but they are setting interest rates for the whole economy and there is no guarantee that the rate or the rapid changes in rates that could be needed to dampen asset price growth will be appropriate more widely. On the other side, regulation and supervision are focused on the resilience and conduct of individual institutions: their management, risks controls, capital and liquidity and so on. What we have found in the last few years is that the sum of what makes sense at the level of individual institutions does not necessarily add up to what is needed for the system as a whole. We need to develop what are called �macro prudential� policies to bridge that gap. In particular we need to establish stronger restraints on the build up of risks in the financial system over the cycle with the dangers they bring to the wider economy. That means not just increasing capital and liquidity requirements for individual institutions but relating them to the cyclical pressures in the system more broadly. One way of doing that has been developed in Spain. It is called �dynamic provisioning�. Chart 9 illustrates how it works. It requires banks to build up a general loss reserve during good times, based on past experience of likely losses on new lending. The effect is to build up reserves when loans are originated which can then be drawn down when the economy begins to deteriorate and actual losses are incurred. That would lessen the need to raise capital in downturns. And as draw downs on these general provisions would be automatic, the market should not view this as negatively as reductions in regulatory capital ratios.  The second lesson comes directly from our experience with Northern Rock where even after the bank had become totally dependent on the State, there was no legal framework for resolving its future quickly and effectively. No regulatory regime can prevent all bank failures. So it is important, for financial stability, that any such failures are orderly. That is the role of the Special Resolution Regime, a key component of the Banking Bill. The SRR gives four tools to the three Tripartite Authorities to cope with failing institutions:  7  � First, the transfer of all or part of a bank�s business to a private sector purchaser; something we have already seen used in the resolution of Bradford and Bingley and Kaupthing under the Special Provisions Act. � Second, the transfer of the viable part of a bank�s business to a temporary bridge bank owned by the Bank of England. This would allow continuity of banking services for its customers whilst enabling due diligence by potential private sector purchasers and providing for the orderly wind down of the rump. � Third, temporary public ownership which would give the treasury the power to transfer the shares of a failing bank to a nominee of the Treasury. This power would be used in cases where significant amounts of public sector funds are required to stabilise the failing bank or where long term restructuring of the bank is necessary. � Fourth bank insolvency procedures - a last resort. This would look much like a standard company insolvency but with the important difference that the liquidator�s primary objective would be to assist the FSCS in protecting depositors. I can understand why there has been some nervousness among banks and investors about this regime and particularly about the powers to split failing banks into �good� and �bad� parts. But equally I think they can see that when a bank is failing it is in everyone�s interests to resolve the situation quickly and cleanly. I hope that they will be reassured by the extensive safeguards we are now proposing, including the guarantee that no creditor will be made worse off in such a split than they would have been in a conventional insolvency and protection of netting and set-off. Finally, the financial turmoil has also revealed the need for better international crisis management. The experience of Lehmans has shown once again the problems that arise in the insolvency of a large international bank with operations in many countries. We also saw in late September and early October the danger emerging, of the banking equivalent of the old beggar thy neighbour policy on currency depreciation, as individual countries began to guarantee their own banks� debt. On the other side, recent events have also demonstrated how effective international action can be: the coordinated interest rate cuts on the 8th of October; the provision of dollar liquidity by central banks and the adoption of national measures to support banks at international meetings during the weekend of 11/12 October. International groups such as the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) have already started to take action. It has begun to develop a practical checklist of issues and principles that should guide the management of a distressed cross-border institution.  8  Having started with Mark Twain I want to finish with another quote this time from from Santayana: �A man�s memory may �become the art of continually varying and misrepresenting his past, according to his interests in the present.�1 One lesson from recent events is the need for rigour, balance and transparency in policy making and risk assessment. I hope that the Bank can play a part in that in future as it has in the past.  1  �Reasons and places�, George Santayana.  9  Chart 1: Financial market liquidity  Chart 2: Household consumption growth: what happened to the boom?

2009-03-19	"Mervyn King: Finance � a return from risk Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, to the Worshipful Company of International Bankers, London, 17 March 2009.                                              *    *   *  Master, Sheriff, My Lords, Alderman, Ladies and Gentlemen,   Introduction The financial turmoil that began in August 2007 led to a financial panic in September 2008 and now to a severe worldwide economic downturn. It is fair to describe the events that followed the failure of Lehman Brothers as the Panic of 2008 because of the almost complete collapse of confidence in financial institutions and the flight of funding that ensued. Perhaps we had forgotten that such panics and banking crises have occurred with depressing regularity in the financial systems of market economies. But the history of the City is in large part the history of banking crises. The measures that central banks took, and continue to take, to restore confidence in the banking system were extreme and on an extraordinary scale � the Bank of England has lent hundreds of billions of pounds to the banking system. But they were not unprecedented � it has happened many times before in crises over the years. So I want tonight to reflect on why we seem to find it so difficult to learn from experience. But even when set against that historical background, the extraordinarily sudden, severe and simultaneous downturn of activity and trade in every corner of the world economy last autumn is remarkable. A collapse of confidence in the coffee houses of Lombard Street was one thing; a collapse of confidence in the world economy is quite another. An examination of these parallels will, I hope, help to throw light on three questions. First, does the nature of financial risk explain the frequency of crises and what does it imply for the design of banking regulation? Second, what are the lessons from the crisis for central banks in their pursuit of both monetary and financial stability? And, third and most urgently, how do we find our way out of the present crisis?   The nature of financial risk and its implications for the regulation of banks There is no shortage of proposals for reform of bank regulation from official groups, such as the Financial Stability Forum, and unofficial groups, such as the G 30, chaired by Paul Volcker and the Geneva Forum. Since the excessive risk-taking of recent years has now given way to an extraordinary degree of risk aversion, there is no hurry to choose among them. Whatever exuberance � rational or irrational � existed has been destroyed by the crisis. So we have time to reflect before we decide on the shape of a new regulatory system. Another reason for reflection is that recent years have seen a natural experiment. Some regulatory systems were light touch, others heavy touch, and yet others placed both ownership and regulation of banks in the public sector. Yet they all failed to some degree to prevent the accumulation of risks that finally produced the crisis. So it is unlikely that there is a simple answer. Any plan for reform should take into account the nature of financial risk. Why were so many people misled for so long? And was there an inherent weakness in the structure of modern banking? Banks are dangerous institutions. They borrow short and lend long. They create liabilities which promise to be liquid and hold few liquid assets themselves. That though is hugely   BIS Review 32/2009                                                                               1 valuable for the rest of the economy. Household savings can be channelled to finance illiquid investment projects while providing access to liquidity for those savers who may need it. But given how risky banks are, it should not be surprising that from time to time they get into trouble. And they have done so regularly since banking began. Confidence in a bank can disappear quickly making it vulnerable to a destructive bank run. If a large number of depositors want liquidity at the same time, banks are forced into early liquidation of assets � lowering their value. And, of course, if banks make sufficient unwise loans to borrowers who do not repay, then that can threaten solvency as well. Banks can of course take their own actions to ensure that investor confidence is maintained. For example, a visible source of liquidity helps. In the panic of 1906, the founder of what is now the Bank of America displayed his gold reserves on the street and offered to convert deposits into gold, creating confidence in his bank at a time when many others failed. Forty years ago, the clearing banks in London held around 30% of their assets in short-term liquid instruments. Today that liquid assets ratio is about 1%. For the major UK banks, almost 25% of customer loans are now funded by short-term borrowing in wholesale markets. At the turn of the new century it was close to zero. This was the distinctive feature of the contemporary British model of banking. Distinctive it may have been; sensible it was not. HBoS and RBS paid the price as the availability of this funding dried up, and not one of the building societies that de-mutualised in the 1980s and 1990s in order to expand beyond the constraints of their deposit base has survived as an independent entity. Banks have changed. They have encouraged the expansion of proprietary trading, the funding of long-term assets in short-term wholesale markets, a rapid expansion of balance sheets and a marked rise in leverage. Commercial banks followed the path of investment banks. Balance sheet size and high leverage were seen as the key to obtaining funds at lowest cost. The total assets held by the world�s largest banks roughly doubled in the five years to the end of 2008, and leverage in UK banks rose on average by two-thirds. The bulk of credit growth in the economy as a whole was taking place within the financial sector. And the complexity of the products being created made it hard to evaluate the underlying risks. Why did banks change so much and take risks which eventually led to some spectacular downfalls? Ultimately, the main factor was an inability to perceive the true nature of the risks involved. In this they were not alone. John Maynard Keynes took pains to distinguish between risk, where probabilities or frequencies could be calculated, and uncertainty, where there is no scientific basis on which to form any probability estimates. Keynes went on, in an article published in 1937, to spell out exactly how we tend to behave in the face of such ignorance. It explains a great deal of recent behaviour in financial markets. Keynes argued that uncertainty affects our behaviour in three ways: �(1) We assume that the present is a much more serviceable guide to the future than a candid examination of past experience would show it to have been hitherto. In other words we largely ignore the prospect of future changes about the actual character of which we know nothing. (2) We assume that the existing state of opinion as expressed in prices and the character of existing output is based on a correct summing up of future prospects, so that we can accept it as such unless and until something new and relevant comes into the picture. (3) Knowing that our own individual judgement is worthless, we endeavour to fall back on the judgement of the rest of the world which is perhaps better informed. That is, we endeavour to conform to the behaviour of the majority or the average. The psychology of a society of individuals each of whom is endeavouring to copy the others leads to what we may strictly term a conventional judgement�. This suggests that it is very hard to take a truly independent view � especially a contrarian one that recognises the possibility that improbable but conceivable events could result in   2                                                                                   BIS Review 32/2009 large losses. In other words, the sheer difficulty of forecasting the future makes it hard for contrarian investors without substantial net worth to survive in the market. As a result the market is vulnerable to �sudden and violent changes�. As Keynes put it, �the forces of disillusion may suddenly impose a new conventional basis of valuation. � At all times the vague panic fears and equally vague and unreasoned hopes are not really lulled, and lie but a little way below the surface�. So a conventional wisdom that leads to a speculative mania, can quickly collapse as sentiment turns on its head. But a speculative mania is not the product solely of the creative imagination of financial engineers. It requires the willing collaboration of gullible investors, who may not fully appreciate the risks that they are taking. Take a simple example of an investment that provides a long, regular stream of profits interspersed with occasional large losses, such that on average you would expect it to have the same return as a safe investment � not an unreasonable characterisation it would now appear of many of the investment strategies of recent years. Over short time periods, where it is unlikely that disaster will strike, it is more likely than not that investors will come out ahead, with a high return. But over long periods, where the risk that disaster will strike at some point is higher, it is likely that the overall return will be worse than the safe investment. And, because charges are often structured so that investment managers receive more of the upside from risky behaviour than they share in the downside, they have an incentive to promote the risky investment strategy. That, allied to a massive increase in the complexity of financial products and instruments in recent years, has meant that investors have, perhaps unwittingly, aided an enormous increase in the risks being run in the financial system. Given these problems, it seems to me that regulation should aim to be simple and robust. Overly complex measures of risk and capital adequacy are rarely robust to developments that are easy neither to anticipate nor calibrate. And robust rules for regulation will of necessity need to be simple or supervisors will be lost in a morass of unnecessary detail. For the same reasons we should not expect too much of regulation. Conventional judgment is a safe haven for bankers and regulators alike. It is not easy to persuade people, especially those who are earning vast sums as a result, that what looks successful in the short run is actually highly risky in the long run. As in monetary policy, it is unlikely that prudential supervision can be implemented as a set of rules to be applied mechanically. Nevertheless, to rely solely on the discretionary judgment of individual bankers and regulators is asking too much of human capabilities. This suggests that the principle of constrained discretion, applied so successfully in monetary policy, needs to be applied to banking regulation. That is not to say that a similar institutional apparatus would be appropriate, but we need to build into the system some simple and robust impediments to excessive risk-taking that can be monitored. And we must ensure that an institutional memory is maintained so that the lessons from the crisis are not forgotten and those impediments to excessive risk-taking are not swept away once memories of the crisis recede. The design of those impediments should be based on an explicit identification of the market failures that regulation can hope to correct. Such market failures seem to relate to two dimensions of banking � the �cross-section� and the �time-series� aspects of behaviour. The former reflects the extreme interconnectedness of banks. Each individual institution can appear relatively safe while the links between them mean that the system as a whole is vulnerable. Any shock could lead banks to fail through a domino effect. The superstructure of complex transactions within the financial sector (in derivatives for example) greatly increased this interconnectedness. The time-series aspect is the pro-cyclical behaviour of risk-taking in the financial system that I described earlier. Optimism feeds on itself until the occasional setback changes the mood to one of pessimism. And individuals are reluctant to accept that success may not be the     BIS Review 32/2009                                                                                  3 result of superior wisdom, which should naturally be reflected in compensation, but the short- run outcome of a risky strategy. To deal with the �cross-section� problems we need to reduce the exposure of the system to domino effects. For some, especially over-the-counter, markets this could be achieved by increasing the role of central counterparty clearing houses. Much good work on this is going on, led by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But a clearing house should not be an excuse for allowing flawed financial instruments, such as many of the mortgage-backed securities, to be treated as high quality assets. We also need to improve the regulation of the liquidity of banks. After the crisis began, the most striking feature of the regulatory system, as embodied in the Basel arrangements and implemented in the UK, was the absence of any effective regulation of liquidity. The FSA is acting to remedy the situation, and the Bank is in active discussion with FSA about how such regulation should best be implemented. More attention has been paid to the �time-series� dimension where there is now a clear international consensus among the members of the Financial Stability Forum and the Basel Committee that some form of counter-cyclical prudential supervision is required. The principle has been established. To correct these types of market failure will require a system of regulation that effectively marries the �top down� assessment of the risks to the system as a whole to the �bottom up� supervision of individual institutions. The present system has not delivered that. A lot of detailed work needs to be done to convert these general principles into concrete implementation. How would the interaction between the �cross-section� and �time-series� risks be taken into account? Would the framework take the form of an addition to capital requirements as a function of the degree of maturity mismatch, leverage or the rate at which the balance sheet was expanding? Or would there be a limit on leverage ratios? How would leverage and maturity mismatch embedded in the assets side of the balance sheet be taken into account? And how would the framework be implemented for banks whose assets and liabilities span jurisdictions? Can we define a group of institutions that are systemically significant? In the present crisis most institutions are deemed to be potentially systemic because of the impact of the failure of any of them on creditor confidence. If most banks appear systemic in a crisis won�t countries want to require foreign banks to be subsidiaries not branches? And, more fundamentally, should there be a Glass-Steagall type of provision to prevent retail deposits from being used to fund investment banking activities? There are good arguments in favour � to separate the utility functions of a retail bank taking household deposits and running the payments system from the casino trading of an investment bank, and good arguments against � the difficulty of maintaining a credible boundary between those institutions that are eligible to receive government support and those that are not. We need a public and informed debate on the merits of the arguments. We also should reflect on the fact that the belief that the authorities will step in when risks materialise encourages risk taking and means that risk-adjusted returns to financial activity are too high. The experience of unsustainably high returns in normal times interspersed by regular crises has been repeated across countries and over time. So if banks are to bear the true cost of the risks they take, changes need to be made to the environment in which banks operate. All these are important issues. While committing at international level to broad principles on regulatory reform, such as extending the net to all highly leveraged institutions and making capital requirements counter-cyclical, there is time to think through carefully the best way to implement them, and it is important that we take it. Many of these questions about the future of the regulatory structure will be discussed in the Turner review to be launched tomorrow. The Bank awaits the Review with interest. It will wish to take time to reflect carefully on the Report before expressing a view.   4                                                                                BIS Review 32/2009 Given what has happened there is now international support for developing a counter-cyclical toolkit for the prudential supervision of banks. But let us be clear what such tools would have entailed had they operated in the past. They would have imposed constraints on the growth and profitability of bank balance sheets. They would have been seen as a tax on the success of the investment banking community and the City of London more generally. And that would have taken place at a time when virtually the entire weight of opinion, not only in this country but also abroad, was in favour of the expansion of financial services. Indeed, just before the financial turmoil broke out in the summer of 2007, there was a debate in New York about the need to follow London�s example of unfettered markets if they were not to lose ground.   What are the lessons for central banks? With the passage of the new Banking Act last month, the Bank of England now has two objectives enshrined in statute: monetary stability and financial stability. Events of the past six months show that there are limits to what can be achieved in respect of either objective. No policy framework can, or should be expected to, stabilise output when demand in the rest of the world suddenly and simultaneously �falls off a cliff�, to use the expression heard so often in recent months. Even the safety valve of a floating exchange rate cannot insulate an economy from its trading partners. World trade fell by around 5% in the final quarter of 2008. 54 of the 56 nations for which data are available for the fourth quarter registered falls in industrial output. 7 of those suffered double digit declines. For many years trade has been the route to faster growth. Now trade is leading the world down as the economies most adversely affected by the current downturn are those most dependent on exports, such as Japan and some of the other Asian economies, not those with the worst banking problems. Sharp changes in sentiment, confidence, animal spirits � whatever words you care to use � are capable of wreaking havoc on the world and our own economy. I shall turn later to our immediate response to the crisis. I want first, however, to ask whether central banks have the right instruments and the right policy frameworks to deal with a world in which some of the biggest risks are of the type I have discussed earlier, namely events which occur very infrequently but when they do so have large adverse effects; events such as those through which we are living. In other words, was our framework suitable for a world of stability but inadequate for preventing or responding to large adverse shocks? In particular, should central banks continue to use their single monetary policy instrument � in our case Bank Rate, supplemented when necessary by unconventional operations � to aim solely at price stability, or should they aim also at wider financial stability objectives, as some have suggested? For over fifteen years Bank Rate has been set to meet an inflation target. And it was very successful in achieving that objective until commodity prices pushed up inflation in 2007. Since the Monetary Policy Committee was established, the average inflation rate has been only 0.1 percentage points away from the target. The strategy of inflation targeting ensured that the MPC maintained a balance between overall demand and supply in the economy. We could, of course, have pursued a different policy. We could have set interest rates consistently at a higher level in order to lower the growth of domestic demand below the rate at which inflation was stable and close to the target. In the words of my predecessor, we could have rejected the approach of accepting �unbalanced growth rather than no growth�. But to argue that Bank Rate should have been set to achieve not price stability but other objectives would have meant accepting rising unemployment and falling inflation. And that would not have altered long-term interest rates in world capital markets and �irrational exuberance� in financial markets in the US and elsewhere. If we want to slow the growth of the financial sector balance sheet, and most of the expansion of credit in recent years was within the financial sector, we can surely do better than raising Bank Rate to a level that undermines the real economy and our commitment to the inflation target.     BIS Review 32/2009                                                                              5 As Chairman Bernanke rightly emphasised last week, one of the causes of the crisis was the impact of the growing current account imbalances on financial intermediation in the main deficit countries, the US and the UK. The large and persistent inflows of capital lowered market interest rates to extremely low levels and encouraged the �search for yield�. In response, the financial services industry rediscovered the time-honoured way of raising rates of return � increasing leverage and taking more risk while finding ways of making the degree of risk less transparent. The crisis resulted from the interaction between the �micro� behaviour of banks and other institutions in creating new financial assets and the �macro� economic strategies pursued by the world�s major countries. If we are to make crises less likely in future we will need to concentrate on policies covering these interactions. The size to which the current account imbalances were allowed to grow reflected the fact that the international monetary system, such as it is, placed no pressures on surplus countries and that the main debtor country issued the world�s reserve currency. Year after year international meetings expressed surprise, and indeed concern, that the imbalances continued to accumulate, but in the absence of a correction the theme became a worn groove in discussions and interest waned. The more forcefully the warnings were expressed, the more they were ignored, precisely because each country appeared able on its own to achieve price stability and steady growth despite the continued build-up of the imbalances. The consequences of this are now evident: a severe global downturn affecting virtually every country in the world. In a world of imbalances it is just as dangerous to rely too heavily on foreign demand for goods and services as it is to rely excessively on foreign borrowing. Surely now no country can be indifferent to the objective of improving the consistency of our macroeconomic strategies. So I hope that the debate about the need for symmetric obligations on surplus and debtor countries alike will move on from previous unsuccessful dialogues stretching back to the Bretton Woods conference in 1944. Turning to the �micro� cause of the crisis, a root cause was a degree of over optimism in financial markets. History, whether the run up to the 1929 stock market crash or more recently in the dotcom mania, suggests that only very substantial rises in short-term interest rates will bring to an end the excessive speculation, and that such rises bring about the very recession which the policy is designed to avert. What is needed is an additional instrument, or possibly a set of instruments, to provide the authorities with the ability to control the growth of the financial sector and its interactions with the wider economy. A set of counter-cyclical policy instruments is the right response to the dilemma of trying to use Bank Rate to control both inflation and excessive expansion of the financial sector. It provides the �top-down� judgement for prudential supervision that I described earlier, but detailed work is needed to flesh out that general principle.   How should we deal with the present crisis? I have spoken so far about the long-term lessons of the crisis for the structure of banking and its regulation. But the immediate need is to deal with the extraordinarily steep and simultaneous downturn in so many economies around the world, and to stabilise the banking system in those countries where it has failed. That should be the main priority at the forthcoming G20 Summit. There are three parts to the required policy response. First, there is an urgent need for a collective commitment by all the countries in the G20 to restore confidence. Second, in those countries where the banking system has failed, there must be a credible promise that banks will be restructured and recapitalised so that they can resume their normal functions and support the flow of credit to their own and other economies. Third, we need to identify and explain a coherent exit strategy through which all of the unprecedented official policy actions can be unwound and which provides a bridge back to stability.     6                                                                                     BIS Review 32/2009 A joint commitment to a macroeconomic stimulus � the division between monetary and fiscal measures is a matter for individual countries to determine � is required to ensure a growth of nominal demand sufficient to reverse the extraordinarily steep and simultaneous downturn in output around the world. Much has already been done. But the measures need to add up to a collective determination to support an adequate level of money spending, and will need to include actions to help poorer countries borrow either from the IMF or on world capital markets. Without that collective commitment, countries may neglect the beneficial effects that their policy actions can have on other countries, resulting in an excessively cautious approach. The G20 summit in London in two weeks time offers an opportunity and a challenge. The occasions on which the words and actions of policy-makers really matter are probably fewer than many of us care to admit. But this is one of them. And I was encouraged by an unusual sense of determination at the G20 Ministerial Meeting at the weekend to show a collective commitment to deal with our problems. In the UK we are already taking unprecedented action to boost nominal spending. The Government announced a temporary fiscal stimulus in the Pre-Budget Report in November. Bank Rate has been reduced by 4� percentage points in the past six months. And this month the Bank began a series of asset purchases aimed at boosting the supply of money in the economy directly. In due course, this will act to expand money spending. In its entire 300 year history, the Bank of England has never acted so swiftly or extensively in response to an economic downturn. The second aspect of the required policy response is effective stabilisation of the banking system. The experience of those countries that have most successfully resolved banking problems, such as Sweden in the early 1990s, suggests that that will require uncertainty about the values of some of the more opaque assets on bank balance sheets to be dispelled. It will take many months to audit forensically the true state of those balance sheets and for some of the underlying macroeconomic uncertainty to dissipate. In the meantime governments have to stabilise the banking system by reassuring creditors in order to prevent the risk of either retail or wholesale runs of the kind we saw in the Panic of 2008. They have to subscribe sufficient equity capital � plain ordinary equity � in order to underpin the capital position of banks in the event of future losses. Although there are different ways to do this (splitting banks, insuring pools of assets), they all have in common a commitment to provide contingent capital to banks so that core equity capital does not fall below some minimum ratio and so creditors are protected. It follows that governments must be prepared to hold whatever proportion of equity capital turns out to be necessary. The final part of the policy response relates to the longer term. There needs to be a clear exit route by which the extraordinary level of official financial support will be unwound as conditions return to normal. And there needs to be a credible commitment to implement the longer term reforms. For monetary policy, the inflation target provides a natural guide to when, and by how much, the extraordinary degree of policy stimulus should be withdrawn. In particular, the outlook for inflation will determine when and by how much asset purchases are in due course reversed and the timing of a return of interest rates to more normal levels. For fiscal policy, there needs to be a credible plan for consolidation of deficits and debt in the future contingent on the state of the economy. And in terms of support to the banking sector, governments should signal their commitment to return banks to the private sector once balance sheets have been restructured. In the UK that will be underpinned by UKFI formulating an explicit mechanism through which the Government�s shares can in due course be sold back to the private sector. There will also, eventually, need to be a way to scale back the extraordinary levels of liquidity support provided by central banks during the crisis. The Bank of England has lent, and continues to lend, over �300 billion pounds through our repo operations and the Special Liquidity Scheme. And a backstop of further liquidity support is still available if the system    BIS Review 32/2009                                                                              7 requires it through our discount window. The Federal Reserve has lent more than $900 billion dollars, and the ECB around �700bn. Relative to GDP, the balance sheet of the three central banks has broadly doubled during the crisis. But in providing this support, central banks cannot offer long-term funding and should not offer support against assets that are unlikely to have a viable future in the absence of official intervention. At some point central bank balance sheets will need to contract. Finally, although I have stressed the need to take time to think through carefully the long run reforms required, we need to commit now, while the political will exists, to a process for decisions on long-term reforms in key areas such as bank regulation, reform of the international monetary system and the governance of international financial institutions.   Conclusions Why did no one see this crisis coming? In fact, most of the underlying causes of the crisis attracted attention from economists, central banks, international financial institutions and regulators. But the difficulty of overcoming coordination or collective action problems meant that nothing was done. Banks felt that they had to keep on dancing while the music was playing. Regulators could never prove that the risks they identified would crystallize, and the �top down� and �bottom up� dimensions of prudential supervision were not married. Central banks and the IMF discussed the imbalances for so long that some came to believe that they were crying wolf. And no one country could prevent the world wide increase in asset prices. Christopher Fildes� law of the financial cycle says that �disasters happen when the last man who can remember what happened last time has retired�. Periods of euphoria and panics in the financial system are inherent features of a market economy. They are the cost we pay for the benefits of a market economy � long-run increases in our standard of living which other systems have failed to deliver. After another twenty years or so, memories of the Panic of 2008 will have faded, and the regulations put in place in its wake will no doubt be seen as old-fashioned, inhibiting of the potential of the City, and as ripe to be swept away as was the Glass-Steagall separation of commercial and investment banking in the United States a few years ago. A lesson of history is that few generations have been able to avoid a repetition of earlier banking crises. The essential problem is that we can no more bind our successors than our predecessors were able to bind us. Rare events, even"
2009-06-19	"Mervyn King: Monetary policy developments Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Lord Mayor�s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London at the Mansion House, London, 17 June 2009.                                             *    *   *  My Lord Mayor, Mr Chancellor, My Lords, Ministers, Aldermen, Mr Recorder, Sheriffs, Ladies and Gentlemen, It has been quite a year. A year to remember, but not to repeat. Since we last met, a financial panic swept through markets in September, several major financial institutions failed, and a remarkable collapse of confidence around the world led to unprecedented declines in industrial production and national output. World trade fell by almost 15% in six months, a faster rate of decline than in the Great Depression. Faced with this crisis, the Bank of England took extraordinary actions. Bank Rate was cut virtually to zero, and the Monetary Policy Committee embarked on a programme of �125 billion of asset purchases. And in your own businesses you too have had to deal with what some have called a once-in-a-century event. Since the panic last autumn, overall output has fallen by around 3% in the United States and the United Kingdom, 6% in Germany, and 7% in Japan. The collapse of spending in these economies is having painful consequences. In less than a year, over 5 million jobs have been lost in the United States, almost 2 million in the euro area, and almost half a million here in the United Kingdom. Despite those unprecedented falls in activity, there are some signs that the British economy is beginning to stabilise, and financial markets have improved markedly. There are three solid reasons for thinking that a recovery in activity was likely to occur at some point this year. The first I call the �Honda effect� � many firms, as Honda did last year at its plant in Swindon, cut back production and met demand from stock, resuming production this year once inventories had been reduced. The second factor is the level of sterling which, despite its recent rally, is still some 20% lower than in the summer of 2007. That will encourage a switch in spending, at home and abroad, towards goods and services produced in the UK. Finally, and perhaps most important, is the enormous policy stimulus that has been injected into the economy. Bank Rate was cut by four percentage points in four months. But the Monetary Policy Committee judged that even that was insufficient to prevent inflation falling below our 2% target, and so it embarked on a programme of asset purchases designed to increase the money supply and improve conditions in non-bank corporate credit markets. The programme will shortly be extended to working capital finance, which should be of particular help to smaller companies. But the Bank must not become the arbiter of the allocation of public credit to individual companies or sectors � such decisions are rightly and necessarily the province of government. So there is a limit to the scope of the Bank�s activities in this area. The success of the policy is not to be judged by the increase in bank lending. Its aim is to increase the money supply. There are already tentative signs that the programme is beginning to have beneficial effects with the growth rate of broad money picking up. So there are certainly grounds for believing that the rapid falls in activity are coming to an end. But there are some equally solid reasons for believing that the path to full recovery could be protracted. The most obvious is that the supply of bank lending to companies and    BIS Review 76/2009                                                                              1 households remains constrained. The stock of bank lending to non-financial companies has been falling in recent months, and household lending has been flat. Part of this undoubtedly reflects weak demand in the face of the recession. But the evidence from prospective borrowers, and the terms on which lenders are willing to extend credit, suggest that banks� ability to finance a sustained recovery remains impaired by low levels of equity capital. Stress tests designed to assess the viability of banks are very different from tests of the capacity of the banking system to finance a recovery. Investors continue to demand high returns to finance banks. Put bluntly, market data on credit spreads imply that some banks are viewed as a worse credit risk than some of their customers. As a result, companies that can bypass the banks to access capital markets directly are doing so. Indeed, in the first four months of this year, more finance was raised in debt and equity markets than is normally the case in an entire year. Most companies, however, especially smaller and medium-sized enterprises, rely heavily on bank finance. And with current market sentiment it may take further additions to equity capital before the banking system will be able to supply credit at a price and on a scale to finance a sustained recovery. That is likely to take time. It is too soon to reverse the extraordinary policy stimulus that has been injected into the UK economy through monetary policy, the provision of liquidity support to banks, guarantees of bank funding, and fiscal policy. Nevertheless, it is not too early to prepare such �exit strategies� and to explain how they would work. The challenge facing the Monetary Policy Committee is straightforward in principle but difficult in practice. As activity returns to more normal levels, the outlook for inflation will pick up. And it is the outlook for inflation that will guide decisions on the pace and timing of a withdrawal of monetary stimulus. Reaching judgements on the outlook for inflation is never easy, and assessing their implications for policy will always be a matter of balancing risks. In contrast, the choice of instruments is simple. When appropriate the MPC will raise Bank Rate and gradually run down its portfolio of assets in a manner consistent with maintaining orderly markets. Just as no one should plan on the present degree of monetary stimulus persisting indefinitely, so too no bank should expect that the current extraordinary liquidity support will continue for ever. In due course, a strategy will be needed to exit from that temporary support, and from the extensive bank guarantees, to the permanent regime for liquidity insurance that the Bank announced last year. The Bank of England will talk with the banks about how to manage the transition. As we emerge from recession, fiscal policy too will have to change. In taking the extraordinary measures to stabilise banks and the wider economy, some of the past build-up of debt has been transferred from the private to the public sector. And it was right to use a temporary fiscal stimulus to counter the depth of the downturn experienced last year. But five years from now national debt, as a proportion of national income, is expected to be more than double its level before the crisis. So it is also necessary to produce a clear plan to show how prospective deficits will be reduced during the next Parliament, so returning to a gradually declining path for the ratio of national debt to national income. We must learn lessons from the events of the past two years. They cannot be final conclusions because the present crisis has some way to run. But two stand out. First, price stability does not guarantee stability of the economy as a whole. Second, the instruments used to pursue financial stability are in need of sharpening and refining. Setting Bank Rate to maintain price stability was successful in itself, but did not prevent a recession induced by a financial crisis. But let�s not throw out the baby with the bathwater. The period prior to the crisis was the most stable economic environment for generations. And, unlike most previous recessions, this crisis wasn�t preceded by an unsustainable boom in output. In the five years leading up to the crisis, overall GDP growth remained close to its long-run average and inflation differed from the 2% target on average by only 0.2 percentage   2                                                                                     BIS Review 76/2009 points. Diverting monetary policy from its goal of price stability risks making the economy less stable and the financial system no more so. To argue that monetary policy should be directed to counter inadequately priced risk is to argue that unemployment is a price worth paying to tame the banking system. Inflation targeting is a necessary but not sufficient condition for stability in the economy as a whole. When a policy is necessary but not sufficient, the answer is not to abandon, but to augment, it. Indeed, the overarching lesson from this crisis is that the authorities lacked sufficient policy instruments to take effective actions. Nowhere was this more evident than in dealing with Northern Rock in the absence of proper resolution powers. For domestic institutions that particular issue was settled by the Banking Act 2009, and the new resolution powers were successfully deployed by the Bank to deal with the Dunfermline Building Society in March. What other powers are required? There is a broad consensus that our traditional policy instruments need to be augmented by a �macro-prudential� toolkit. But what are such �macro-prudential� instruments for? Are they to increase the resilience of individual banks, or are they to protect the economy from the banks? The former implies a sensible extension of the current regime of capital requirements for individual institutions. The latter goes to the heart of the problems caused by the financial sector as a whole for the rest of the economy. We need to reflect more deeply on the nature of the failures before designing a regulatory response � after all many financial markets continued to function well. But banks entered the crisis with historically low levels of liquid assets, and inadequate levels of capital with which to absorb losses. Moreover, in the United Kingdom, the financial sector became too big and too highly leveraged. First, the size of our banking system was, as a proportion of GDP, five times that in the United States, and the risks to the UK taxpayer correspondingly greater. Second, the process of reducing very high leverage is doing great damage to the rest of the economy. And the required adjustment still has a long way to run � few of the largest banks in the United Kingdom managed to reduce their leverage ratios through 2008, which remain at historically high levels. Third, interconnections between institutions create potential fragilities across the system, as we saw last September. Fourth, the risks associated with large-scale proprietary trading are probably harder to control in limited liability companies. So we need instruments to prevent the size, leverage, fragility and risk of the financial system from becoming too great. The resulting �macro-prudential� toolkit will contain a number of instruments to reduce risk, both across the system and over time. It must not be put together in a hurry. And I share the concerns of many of you that we are a long way from identifying precise regulatory interventions that would improve the functioning of markets. As far as individual banks are concerned, we face some uncomfortable choices about the structure and regulation of our banking sector. If some banks are thought to be too big to fail, then, in the words of a distinguished American economist, they are too big. It is not sensible to allow large banks to combine high street retail banking with risky investment banking or funding strategies, and then provide an implicit state guarantee against failure. Something must give. Either those guarantees to retail depositors should be limited to banks that make a narrower range of investments, or banks which pose greater risks to taxpayers and the economy in the event of failure should face higher capital requirements, or we must develop resolution powers such that large and complex financial institutions can be wound down in an orderly manner. Or, perhaps, an element of all three. Privately owned and managed institutions that are too big to fail sit oddly with a market economy. One important practical step would be to require any regulated bank itself to produce a plan for an orderly wind down of its activities. That would provide the information to the authorities the absence of which made past decisions about the future of institutions difficult. Making a will should be as much a part of good housekeeping for banks as it is for the rest of us. And it would be sensible for the various authorities to work across national boundaries to identify detailed plans for how each large cross-border financial institution could be wound down.    BIS Review 76/2009                                                                              3 The Bank of England has a new statutory responsibility for financial stability. Bank Rate is the instrument we deploy to achieve monetary stability, and should be used exclusively for that purpose. To achieve financial stability the powers of the Bank are limited to those of voice and the new resolution powers. The Bank finds itself in a position rather like that of a church whose congregation attends weddings and burials but ignores the sermons in between. Like the church, we cannot promise that bad things won�t happen to our flock � the prevention of all financial crises is in neither our nor anyone else�s power, as a study of history or human nature would reveal. And experience suggests that attempts to encourage a better life through the power of voice is not enough. Warnings are unlikely to be effective when people are being asked to change behaviour which seems to them highly profitable. So it is not entirely clear how the Bank will be able to discharge its new statutory responsibility if we can do no more than issue sermons or organise burials. Whatever the ultimate shape of the structure and regulation of the banking system � and, as many of you have said, we need to think carefully to get this right � change will be necessary. The costs of this crisis are not to be measured simply in terms of its impact on public finances, the destruction of wealth, and the number of jobs lost. They are also to be seen in the lost trust in the financial sector among other parts of our economy. For a generation or more, businesses and families up and down the country were told, not least by the City, that the disciplines of the market economy were essential, even if painful in the short run, for greater prosperity in the longer term. That belief in the merits of a market economy was embraced and for many years was not misplaced. But out of the blue � in this case the financial sector � came a crisis that did not stem from weaknesses in the real economy. It has wreaked havoc on those same businesses and families. Unemployment, as we saw in today�s figures, is rising sharply. And yet it is the banking system that has received financial support on an almost unimaginable scale. We who work in the financial sector have much to do to regain the trust of those who work outside it. �My word is my bond� are old words, but they were important. �My word is my CDO-squared� will never catch on. There is no support in this country, and no case, for excessively bureaucratic regulation. But change to the structure, regulation and indeed culture of our banking system is necessary. Blaming individuals is no substitute for acknowledging the failure of a system, of a certain type of banking. We have a real opportunity now to put that right, and regain the trust that has been lost. Lord Mayor, as we prepare to toast the Bankers and Merchants of the City of London, we remember that the City is more than banking and that banking is much more than the trading of complex securities. So all of us here tonight would like to pay tribute to your work since you became Lord Mayor, to support your efforts to promote financial literacy, and to thank both the Lady Mayoress and yourself for the splendid hospitality which you have extended to us all this evening. So I invite you all to rise and join me in the traditional toast of good health and prosperity to ""The Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress"", Ian and Lin Luder.     4                                                                                    BIS Review 76/2009"
2009-10-22	Mervyn King: Monetary policy developments Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, to Scottish business organisations, Edinburgh, 20 October 2009.                                             *    *   *  Two years ago Scotland was home to two of the largest and most respected international banks. Both are now largely state-owned. Sir Walter Scott would have been mortified by these events. Writing in 1826, under the pseudonym of Malachi Malagrowther, he observed that:            �Not only did the Banks dispersed throughout Scotland afford the means of            bringing the country to an unexpected and almost marvellous degree of            prosperity, but in no considerable instance, save one [the Ayr Bank], have            their own over-speculating undertakings been the means of interrupting that            prosperity�. Banking has not been good for the wealth of the Scottish � and, it should be said, almost any other � nation recently. Over the past year, almost six million jobs have been lost in the United States, over 2� million in the euro area, and over half a million in the United Kingdom. Our national debt is rising rapidly, not least as the consequence of support to the banking system. We shall all be paying for the impact of this crisis on the public finances for a generation. The United Kingdom faces two fundamental long-run challenges. First, to rebalance the economy, with more resources allocated to business investment and net exports and fewer to consumption. That is consistent with the need � now widely accepted � to eliminate the large structural fiscal deficit and to raise the national saving rate. It is part of a need for a wider rebalancing of domestic demand in the world economy away from those countries that borrowed and ran current account deficits towards those that lent and ran surpluses. Second, both the structure and regulation of banking in the UK need reform. Banks increased both the size and leverage of their balance sheets to levels that threatened stability of the system as a whole. They remain extraordinarily dependent on the public sector for support. That was necessary in the immediate crisis, but is not sustainable in the medium term. These two challenges are interrelated. In creating the crisis, imbalances in the world economy led to unusually low real interest rates and large net capital flows from the emerging market economies to the developed world. That provided the fuel which an inadequately designed regulatory system ignited to produce the financial firestorm that engulfed us all. If our response to the crisis focuses only on the symptoms rather than the underlying causes of the crisis, then we shall bequeath to future generations a serious risk of another crisis even worse than the one we have experienced. Tonight I want to focus on the second of those challenges � reform of the structure and regulation of the banking system. Why were banks willing to take risks that proved so damaging both to themselves and the rest of the economy? One of the key reasons � mentioned by market participants in conversations before the crisis hit � is that the incentives to manage risk and to increase leverage were distorted by the implicit support or guarantee provided by government to creditors of banks that were seen as �too important to fail�. Such banks could raise funding more cheaply and expand faster than other institutions. They had less incentive than others to guard against tail risk. Banks and their creditors knew that if they were sufficiently important to the economy or the rest of the financial system, and things went wrong, the government would always stand behind them. And they were right.     BIS Review 129/2009                                                                             1 The sheer scale of support to the banking sector is breathtaking. In the UK, in the form of direct or guaranteed loans and equity investment, it is not far short of a trillion (that is, one thousand billion) pounds, close to two-thirds of the annual output of the entire economy. To paraphrase a great wartime leader, never in the field of financial endeavour has so much money been owed by so few to so many. And, one might add, so far with little real reform. It is hard to see how the existence of institutions that are �too important to fail� is consistent with their being in the private sector. Encouraging banks to take risks that result in large dividend and remuneration payouts when things go well, and losses for taxpayers when they don�t, distorts the allocation of resources and management of risk. That is what economists mean by �moral hazard�. The massive support extended to the banking sector around the world, while necessary to avert economic disaster, has created possibly the biggest moral hazard in history. The �too important to fail� problem is too important to ignore. There are only two ways in which the problem can � in logic � be solved. One is to accept that some institutions are �too important to fail� and try to ensure that the probability of those institutions failing, and hence of the need for taxpayer support, is extremely low. The other is to find a way that institutions can fail without imposing unacceptable costs on the rest of society. Any solution must fall into one of those two categories. What does this mean in practice? Consider the first approach. To reduce the likelihood of failure, regulators can impose capital requirements on a wide range of financial institutions related to the risks they are taking. This is the current approach underpinned by the Basel regime. In essence, it makes banks build a buffer against adverse events. It has attractions but also problems. First, capital requirements reduce, but not eliminate, the need for taxpayers to provide catastrophe insurance. Second, the �riskiness� of a bank�s activities and the liquidity of its funding can change suddenly and radically as market expectations shift. This means that what appeared to be an adequate capital or liquidity cushion one day appears wholly inadequate the next. Indeed, the Achilles heel of the Basel regime is the assumption that there is a constant capital ratio which delivers the desired degree of stability of the banking system. After the experience of the past two years, and a decade or more in which capital ratios fell and leverage ratios rose to historically unprecedented levels, banks need more capital to persuade investors to fund them. A larger buffer gives new creditors greater comfort that their claims will be met in future, without resort to the public purse. And rather than pay out dividends or generous remuneration, banks should use earnings to build larger capital buffers. But how much larger? We simply don�t know. A higher ratio is safer than a lower one, but any fixed ratio is bound to be arbitrary. One way of dealing with this problem is to require banks to take out insurance in the form of �contingent capital�, that is capital in a form that automatically converts to common equity upon the trigger of a threshold that kicks in before a bank becomes insolvent. If a bank�s regulatory core tier 1 capital � common equity � remained above the threshold, nothing would happen. But if the regulatory core tier 1 capital fell below the threshold then the contingent capital would automatically be converted to common equity. When bank failures impose costs on the rest of the economy, it is reasonable to insist that banks themselves purchase a sufficient degree of insurance in the form of a large capital cushion available automatically before insolvency. Such contingent capital instruments are very different from instruments, such as subordinated debt, which banks have been permitted to count as capital under the Basel regime, but which do not provide a reliable capital buffer until too late � after the bank has failed. So at present the taxpayer is providing capital that is exposed to future losses rather than investors in debt-like capital instruments of a troubled bank. Whether investors would be willing to provide contingent capital on the required scale would depend upon the price, but at least the cost would fall where it belongs � on the banks.   2                                                                                  BIS Review 129/2009 So the first approach to the �too important to fail� problem might be made to work with a requirement for contingent capital. It is worth a try. But it has three drawbacks. First, banks still have an incentive to take really big risks because the government would provide some back-stop catastrophe insurance. Second, experience has shown that it is difficult to assess risks of infrequent but high-impact events, and so it is dangerous to allow activities characterised by such risks to contaminate the essential � or utility � services that the banking sector provides to the wider economy. Both of these drawbacks mean that it is almost impossible to calculate how much contingent capital would be appropriate. And a third drawback is that the approach probably requires the extension of detailed regulation, and especially a special resolution regime, to all institutions deemed �too important to fail� � or could become �too important to fail� in the middle of a crisis � in order to prevent a bank failure leading to conventional insolvency procedures. It remains to be seen whether that scope would be easy to define beforehand. Failure to deal with the underlying problem draws regulators deeper into murky waters. The second approach rejects the idea that some institutions should be allowed to become �too important to fail�. Instead of asking who should perform what regulation, it asks why we regulate banks. It draws a clear distinction between different activities that banks undertake. The banking system provides two crucial services to the rest of the economy: providing companies and households a ready means by which they can make payments for goods and services and intermediating flows of savings to finance investment. Those are the utility aspects of banking where we all have a common interest in ensuring continuity of service. And for this reason they are quite different in nature from some of the riskier financial activities that banks undertake, such as proprietary trading. In other industries we separate those functions that are utility in nature � and are regulated � from those that can safely be left to the discipline of the market. The second approach adapts those insights to the regulation of banking. At one end of the spectrum is the proposal for �narrow banks�, recently revived by John Kay, which would separate totally the provision of payments services from the creation of risky assets. In that way deposits are guaranteed. At the other is the proposal in the G30 report by Paul Volcker, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, to separate proprietary trading from retail banking. The common element is the aim of restricting government guarantees to utility banking. There are those who claim that such proposals are impractical. It is hard to see why. Existing prudential regulation makes distinctions between different types of banking activities when determining capital requirements. What does seem impractical, however, are the current arrangements. Anyone who proposed giving government guarantees to retail depositors and other creditors, and then suggested that such funding could be used to finance highly risky and speculative activities, would be thought rather unworldly. But that is where we now are. It is important that banks in receipt of public support are not encouraged to try to earn their way out of that support by resuming the very activities that got them into trouble in the first place. The sheer creative imagination of the financial sector to think up new ways of taking risk will in the end, I believe, force us to confront the �too important to fail� question. The belief that appropriate regulation can ensure that speculative activities do not result in failures is a delusion. Separation of activities does not resolve all misaligned incentives. Where private sector entities outside of the utility banking sector engage in a high degree of maturity transformation on a scale that could have consequences for the rest of the economy, the government would not want to stand aside when such an entity fails. That is the heart of the matter. Maturity transformation reduces the cost of finance to a wide range of risky activities, at least some of which are beneficial, but the implicit government guarantee means that the true cost of that maturity mismatch does not, as it should, fall on those who receive the benefits. The aim of policy should be to minimise or eliminate that subsidy. Separation of activities helps not hinders that objective, not least because it is the mixture of activities that    BIS Review 129/2009                                                                              3 reduces the robustness of the system. Although there are no simple answers, it is in our collective interest to reduce the dependence of so many households and businesses on so few institutions that engage in so many risky activities. The case for a serious review of how the banking industry is structured and regulated is strong. By international standards UK banking is highly concentrated. There are four large UK banking groups. Of these four, two are largely in state ownership and their assets are a multiple of the assets of the next largest bank. As in the English Premier League, getting into the top four will not be easy for those outside it. But in both cases I hope greater competition will produce less rigidity in the composition of the top four. Whichever approach to the �too important to fail� problem is adopted, there is growing agreement that such financial institutions should, as I argued at the Mansion House in June, be made to plan for their own orderly wind down � to write their own will. I welcome that, but without separation of the utility from other components of banking it will be necessary to develop detailed resolution procedures for a very wide class of financial institutions. The options may turn out to be separation of activities, on the one hand, or ever increasingly detailed regulatory oversight, with the costs that that entails for innovation in, and the efficiency of, the financial system, on the other. So far, I have discussed measures to ensure that the financial system can continue to function when individual institutions find themselves in difficulty. But there are broader policy goals relevant to financial stability. The crisis certainly suggests that there is a need for additional policy tools that can (a) moderate the growth of the financial sector and (b) lean against the macroeconomic effects of the credit cycle. The Bank is working with others to explore such macro-prudential instruments, and we will be setting out our thinking in a discussion paper and a speech by Paul Tucker later in the week. Given the difficulty of applying such tools to overseas banks, their use in (a) is likely to be more productive than in (b). The key point though is that parallel to the long-established role which monetary policy plays in taking away the punch bowl just as the party gets going, so there is a role for the central bank to use macro-prudential policy instruments for financial stability purposes by turning down the music just as the dancing gets a little too wild. As we focus on how to create a sound and stable financial system, we cannot neglect the rest of the economy. Recent months have brought better news here. Around the world, the sharp falls in output that occurred over the winter have largely come to an end, and business and consumer confidence have improved somewhat. It is likely that in the second half of this year, the UK economy will return to positive, if modest, growth. Financial markets have improved, with banks finding it easier and less costly to access wholesale funding markets, and in time this should ease lending conditions to households and businesses. These developments are encouraging. But they need to be seen in context, and we should be under no illusion that the path to a sustained recovery will be smooth and painless. Output is still well below and unemployment well above their levels of a year ago, and are likely to remain so for sometime. To keep inflation close to the 2% target, monetary policy tries to keep a balance between overall demand and supply. Judging that balance, given an impaired banking sector and the likelihood of a significant fiscal tightening over the next few years, is particularly difficult. At the moment, inflation is 1.1%. Many have forgotten that only a year ago it reached 5.2%. It is likely that inflation will remain volatile over the coming year. It will pick up over the next few months reflecting higher petrol prices, recent falls in sterling and the reversal of the cut in VAT. Looking through these short-run factors, however, inflation will be determined by the path of money spending relative to the supply capacity of the economy. Over the past year money spending, which normally expands at around 5% a year, has fallen by 5%. That is already pulling down on inflation and will continue to do so until spending recovers. To put money spending back on a desirable trajectory is likely to require a pick up in the growth rate    4                                                                                     BIS Review 129/2009 of broad money in the economy. That is precisely what our asset purchase programme, by injecting more money directly into the economy, aims to achieve. In deciding when and by how much our present programme of asset purchases should be either expanded or reduced, the Monetary Policy Committee will continue to base its decision each month on a judgement of the action required to meet the 2% target for inflation. Before the financial crisis, a generation of households and businesses had accepted that the discipline of a market economy was the most promising route to prosperity. Uncomfortable though it seemed, the importance of more flexible labour markets, greater competition in product markets, regulation of privatised utilities and allowing unsuccessful businesses to fail, came to be widely understood. Then, out of what must have appeared to many of you to be a clear blue sky of economic stability, arose a financial firestorm that wreaked substantial damage to the real economy, and we have not yet seen its full consequences. The case for market discipline is no less compelling for banking than for other industries. So I am sure that we can turn this crisis to our long-run advantage by reviewing and reforming the structure and regulation of banking. As Sir Walter Scott noted, the failure of the Ayr Bank in 1772 �was a terrible [warning], and has been so well attended to in Scotland � forcing a capital on the district could only lead to wild speculation, instead of supporting solid and promising undertakings�. Of the bankers themselves, Scott recognised that, while the majority were �good men�, �there may have been, among so numerous a body, men of a different character, fishers in troubled waters, capitalists who sought gain not by the encouragement of fair trade and honest industry, but by affording temporary fuel to rashness or avarice�. If unsustainable capital flows provided the fuel and an inadequately designed regulatory system ignited the fuel, the past two years have shown how dangerous it is to let bankers play with fire. This is not a question of blame � as Sir Walter rightly said, the majority in the industry are �good men� and women. It is a matter of the incentives they face. To protect our genuinely successful financial centres � of which Edinburgh is clearly one � reform of banking is essential. With that, I am confident that we will have attended to our terrible warning and our varied and internationally competitive financial services industry will thrive.

2010-01-22	"Mervyn King: Monetary policy developments Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the University of Exeter, Exeter, 19 January 2010.                                            *    *    *  Some dates are easier to remember than others. 1789 and the French Revolution, 1989 and the fall of the Berlin Wall, 1929 and the Wall Street Crash are easily recalled. How will 2009 be remembered: as the year when the world economy fell off a cliff but was rescued by government and central bank intervention around the world? Or the year when we finally recognised that genuine reform to the international monetary and banking system was essential to restore prosperity? Time will tell. The world economy is now coming out of recession. But the cost of the banking crisis has been high. After an unprecedented period of sustained growth, total output in the United Kingdom has now fallen for six consecutive quarters. It contracted last year by around 5%, the largest fall in output since 1931. National income is around 10% below the level it would have reached in the absence of the financial crisis. Around the world, governments and central banks put a massive sticking plaster on the wounds in the form of an extraordinary degree of monetary and fiscal stimulus. As a result, business confidence, orders and output, which all collapsed at the end of 2008, are gradually recovering. But there is a long period of healing ahead. Although quarterly growth rates of GDP may soon turn positive in the United Kingdom, unemployment is likely to remain high. Fortunately, it has not increased to the 10% rate now experienced in both the United States and the euro area. But at just under 8%, it is markedly above the level to which we had become accustomed during the period known as the �Great Stability�. The sharp monetary squeeze resulting from the efforts by banks to contract their balance sheets is still casting a shadow over the future path of output and employment. Over the past year, broad money growth has slowed sharply to a virtual standstill in the United States, and it turned slightly negative in the euro area. In normal circumstances, we might expect annual rates of increase of between 5% and 10%. At home, annual broad money growth has slowed somewhat less sharply, and remains positive. The unprecedented actions of the Monetary Policy Committee to inject �200 billion directly into the economy � described by some as �quantitative easing� � have averted a potentially disastrous monetary squeeze. The headline in the Racing Post of 29 December said it all: �Quantitativeasing Maintains Perfect Record�. Its Newbury correspondent reported that �Quantitativeasing started as a red-hot favourite and had little trouble maintaining his unbeaten record. Ridden with plenty of confidence his task was made easier when Tail of the Bank came to grief at the second last. His trainer said �I was delighted with the way he went through that testing ground��. Rather like the MPC, the owners of Quantitativeasing, winner of all three of his races in 2009, have yet to decide how many outings he will have in 2010. They are waiting for race conditions to become clearer. The bold action, taken both at home and abroad, helped to end the collapse in confidence and spending last year. But equally bold action will be needed to prevent a similar crisis from recurring. The origins of the crisis lay in our inability to cope with the consequences of the entry into the world trading system of countries such as China, India, and the former Soviet empire � in a word, globalisation. The benefits in terms of trade were visible; the costs of the implied capital flows were not. The new entrants adopted a strategy of expanding manufactured exports to create employment. High rates of saving depressed domestic demand. So substantial trade   BIS Review 4/2010                                                                              1 surpluses were required to keep total demand in line with supply. Equally, the countries importing those manufactured goods ran trade deficits and required low saving rates to maintain balance in their economies. Everyone seemed to gain. High-saving countries created employment, and low-saving countries enjoyed faster consumption growth as cheap imports meant that living standards rose by more than the increase in production � worth around half a percentage point a year in the United Kingdom. These were the benefits of greater trade. But the pattern of poor countries saving a lot and rich countries borrowing was not sustainable. The consequences of our inability to cope with these capital flows did not show up in the usual macroeconomic indicators such as growth, unemployment and inflation. Overall balance in each of the major economies was maintained. Rather, the massive flows of capital from the new entrants into western financial markets pushed down interest rates and encouraged risk-taking on an extraordinary scale. Banks expanded their balance sheets and new instruments were created to satisfy the search for yield. In the five years up to 2007, the balance sheets of the largest UK banks nearly trebled. The build up of risk came to threaten the stability of the entire financial system. Capital flows provided the fuel which the developed world�s inadequately designed and regulated financial system then ignited to produce a firestorm that engulfed us all. To prevent another crisis will require reform to both the regulation and structure of banking and the international monetary system. I have spoken about the former on earlier occasions. Tonight I want to focus on the question of how we can reduce the imbalances in the world economy. Although overall growth in both high and low saving countries was sustainable, the composition of that growth was not. And the composition of growth reflects the interaction between countries� economic policy choices. No individual country faced strong incentives to alter its own choices, but the collective outcome was costly to everyone. The interdependencies between countries can be illustrated by a simple three by three table which I call �Sudoku for economists�, showing the composition of demand in, and the trade flows between, the high- and low-saving groups of countries.                               �Sudoku for Economists�: 2008 data                                         Domestic                                                 Net trade           GDP                                        Demand                          High-saving                                          18,000        1,000       19,000                          countries                           Low-saving                                          28,500       -1,000       27,500                          countries                               Total        46,500          0         46,500                      Source: IMF.                   Data for G20 countries, rounded to the nearest $500 billion.   The key point is that the entries in the table � corresponding to economic policy choices � are interdependent reflecting economic constraints. Total demand or GDP is the sum of domestic demand and net trade. And, assuming for simplicity that the world can be divided    2                                                                                  BIS Review 4/2010 into high- and low-saving countries, the trade surplus of one group is the deficit of the other. Just as in a sudoku puzzle, the nine numbers in the table cannot be chosen independently. Sudoku for economists is simpler than ordinary sudoku because the economic adding-up constraints mean that of the nine numbers in the table, only three can be chosen independently. So, for example, if both groups of countries want to achieve full employment levels of GDP, and the high-saving group targets a trade surplus, the low-saving group cannot target a reduction in its trade deficit. Either trade deficits must remain high, which is not likely to prove sustainable, or something else must give. That might involve a recession in the deficit countries, or an acceptance by the surplus countries that, one way or another, trade imbalances must be reduced. Sudoku for economists shows that countries cannot pursue for long incompatible economic policy frameworks. The reason why continuing large deficits are not sustainable indefinitely is that for every current account deficit there is an equal net capital flow in the opposite direction. Even if those flows remain constant in size, they imply an ever increasing stock of international asset and liability positions. Today China alone has reserves of over two trillion dollars, and Japan another trillion dollars. Adding inexorably to the stock of international assets and liabilities is like adding one brick on top of another to form a tower. With skill, it can be done for a surprisingly long time. But eventually the moment comes when adding one more causes the tower to fall down. If countries do not work together to reduce the �too high to last� imbalances, a crisis of one sort or another in financial markets is only too likely. We saw that following the first oil crisis in the 1970s when the attempt to �recycle petrodollars�, as they were called, led to defaults by a number of emerging market economies and a crisis in western banks. And sudden shifts in capital flows have led to periods of remarkable volatility in exchange rates between the world�s major currencies, the dollar, yen and euro (and, before 1999, the deutschmark). So the problem of global imbalances is hardly new. It was behind many of the currency crises in the post-war period and exercised the participants at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944. And for the past decade it was a regular item on the agenda of international meetings of finance officials at the IMF, G7 and elsewhere. But the incompatibility of different countries� policy frameworks has proved difficult to resolve. At the Bretton Woods Conference, the British economist John Maynard Keynes identified the asymmetry of the obligations placed on surplus and deficit countries as the main source of the problem. He had argued that,        �the process of adjustment is compulsory for the debtor and voluntary for the        creditor. If the creditor does not choose to make, or allow, his share of the        adjustment, he suffers no inconvenience. For whilst a country�s reserve cannot        fall below zero, there is no ceiling which sets an upper limit.� Both the British and the Americans put forward proposals for a system with more symmetric obligations � but without success. For most of the post-war period, the obligations on debtor countries, asymmetric though they may have been, prevented the imbalances from becoming too big. More recently, the fact that the largest deficit country, the United States, was the issuer of the world�s reserve currency allowed the imbalances to continue for a long period, inducing a sense of complacency and threatening the stability of the global economy. So the challenge of designing an international monetary system that could prevent the emergence of �too high to last� imbalances remains. The financial crisis has reminded us all of the importance of solving this problem. Sudoku for economists shows that it is essentially a political and not a technical problem: how can we ensure that the economic policy frameworks of countries are consistent with each other? At present there is no political mechanism for achieving that consistency. Finding such a mechanism is urgent. Having narrowed somewhat at the height of the crisis, the imbalances are now widening again. There is a risk that countries will, out of frustration, impose unilateral    BIS Review 4/2010                                                                                3 and ultimately self-defeating protectionist responses. Because the number of countries involved in the international trading system is now so large, and the countries so diverse, the idea of another Bretton Woods conference is wholly impractical. The IMF, despite the legitimacy bestowed by its membership of 186 countries, is too unwieldy without reform. The G7 omits some of the key players, such as China. Of more immediate promise is the G20 group of countries, which produces almost 90% of world GDP. Last year, under the UK Presidency, the G20 agreed to a new policy coordination framework which commits member countries to a process, using the expertise of the IMF, of assessing the consistency of their national policies. G20 Heads of Government will meet twice this year, in June and November, to discuss progress. So far the only specific agreement is to talk to each other. Concrete steps to reduce the scale of global imbalances have, to date, been notable by their absence. Smiling family photographs marking the attendance at international gatherings are no substitute for specific actions. Still, the G20 has laid its reputation on the line. It will be damaged if the framework comes to nought. Looking further ahead, the legitimacy and leadership of the G20 would be enhanced if it were seen as representing views of other countries too. That could be achieved if the G20 were to metamorphose into a Governing Council for the IMF, and at the same time acquire a procedure for voting on decisions. The economic message from the crisis is clear: low-saving countries will reduce their net borrowing from abroad and so will no longer be able to play the role of consumer of last resort. To maintain levels of economic activity, high-saving countries must expand domestic demand and allow their trade surpluses to shrink. This is easier said than done. It will require changes in prices and most obviously in real exchange rates � via either nominal exchange rates or domestic price levels. In themselves, proposals such as the creation of a new reserve currency do not solve the inconsistency puzzle unless they alter the desire of high- saving countries to run imbalances that are too high to last. But the reason for hope, even if it has not yet triumphed over experience, is that, despite the short-term political considerations that have prevented adjustment so far, the lesson of Sudoku for economists is that cooperation is better than conflict. There are potential gains for all in the longer term. That is why the UK Government put so much effort into the G20 process. It is, as they say, the only game in town. Working with our international partners will be important if we are to achieve reforms to the international monetary system. But, as one of the low-saving group of countries, we must not neglect the need for domestic policy actions. The need for a rebalancing of our economy has been apparent for some time; I spoke about it in a speech just along the coast in Plymouth ten years ago. The proportion of our domestic output that we save has fallen by around a third over the past decade, as the share of consumption, especially public consumption, has risen sharply. Looking ahead, monetary and fiscal policy together must help to bring about a switch of demand from private and public consumption to net exports and business investment as the recovery takes hold. A key element in raising the national saving rate is the elimination over time of the structural deficit in the public finances. Of course, there is a perfectly sensible debate about the appropriate timing of the withdrawal of the temporary fiscal stimulus as the economy recovers. Some has in fact already been withdrawn with the return of the standard rate of VAT to 17.5% at the beginning of the month. But uncertainty about how and when fiscal policy will respond has a direct bearing on monetary policy. And markets can be unforgiving. As Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke said recently about the similar fiscal position in the United States, �near-term challenges must not be allowed to hinder timely consideration of the steps needed to address fiscal imbalances. Unless we demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal sustainability in the longer term, we will have neither financial stability nor healthy     4                                                                                    BIS Review 4/2010 economic growth�. The Chancellor has made clear that the Spring Budget provides the opportunity to do precisely that. Over the past year, the UK economy has battled against the headwinds of an intense monetary squeeze and a sharp fall in world trade, supported by the tailwinds of a huge policy stimulus and a lower exchange rate. At this very early stage of the recovery, it is particularly difficult to judge the medium-term prospects for the economy. Ten years ago, I described how movements in macroeconomic data can sometimes bear a �resemblance to old- fashioned disco dancing � sharp movements in unpredictable directions creating much excitement, accompanied by a good deal of noise�. Over the next few months, the data are likely to be dancing particularly vigorously under the influence of the reversal of the VAT cut, a turnaround in the stock cycle and even the effects of the recent cold weather. Added to that, the MPC is acutely aware that initial data releases are often later heavily revised, and there is uncertainty over the timing of fiscal consolidation. The patience of UK households is likely to be sorely tried over the next couple of years. There is little scope for growth in real take-home pay, which may remain weak even as output recovers. It is clear that inflation is likely to pick up markedly in the first half of this year, a message reinforced by this morning�s news that CPI inflation reached 2.9% in December. The continuing pass-through of the earlier significant depreciation of sterling, while part of the necessary rebalancing of our economy, is offsetting to some extent the downward pressure on inflation from the large amount of spare capacity. And the rise in VAT back to 17.5% means that CPI inflation is likely to rise to over 3% for a while, or even higher for even longer were energy prices or indirect taxes to increase further. Although such price level effects do not constitute a continuing source of inflation, and hence should be temporary, they remain in the official measure of inflation for a full year. Provided monetary growth remains well under control � and remember that at present it is undesirably low � inflation should return to target in the medium term. I hope you will all remember that in both of the past two years inflation picked up as a result of temporary price level factors and then fell back, as the MPC had predicted. So how will 2009 be remembered? As I said at the outset, it is too early to tell. The full impact of the financial crisis has yet to be seen. And the national statisticians will take another two years or so before providing their best estimates of spending and output in the UK economy. More importantly, the question of whether basic reforms to the structure of banking and the international monetary system will be made before another crisis engulfs the world economy remains unanswered.

2010-03-26	"Mervyn King: Uncertainty in macroeconomic policy making � art or science? Lecture by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Royal Society conference on �Handling Uncertainty in Science�, London, 22 March 2010. Accompanying slides to this speech can be found on the Bank of England�s website.  David Aikman, Philip Barrett, Sujit Kapadia, Mervyn King, James Proudman, Tim Taylor, Iain de Weymarn and Tony Yates (Bank of England) contributed to this paper.                                                  *     *    *  1.         Uncertainty and public policy Most questions of public policy relate to uncertainties. Answers depend upon an ability to understand and evaluate those uncertainties. Yet many commentators and members of the public want to believe in certainties. They want to cut through the thickets of caveats and technical difficulties to the �bottom line�. We see this in economic policy, weather forecasting and the interpretation of secret intelligence. Five years ago, the Bank of England and the Met Office held an informal seminar to exchange ideas on how to communicate measures of uncertainty to the general public. Although we failed to persuade broadcasters to explore the issues of economic and weather forecasting in more depth, the bilateral relationship which developed between the Bank and Paul Hardaker, who moved from the Met Office to take over the Royal Meteorological Society, flourished. Today�s conference is a tribute to Paul�s persistence. It could hardly be more timely. At the heart of debates about climate change, the Chilcot Inquiry into the war in Iraq, and the speed of the necessary fiscal consolidation of our public finances, lie questions about how to evaluate and respond to considerable uncertainties. At that seminar in 2005, we discussed three questions. First, in modelling the phenomenon of interest, what is the right balance between simplifying assumptions and technical rigour? Second, how open should we be about what we don�t really know? Third, in communicating uncertainty, how can we prevent the intended audience from focussing excessively on one or two parameters of the underlying distribution at the expense of the whole picture? The discussions compared the Bank of England�s fan charts for the outlook for inflation with the Met Office�s plume charts for forecasts of temperature. This paper updates that discussion, and presents some new ways of communicating uncertainty which are under evaluation by the Monetary Policy Committee. Reference to economics and meteorology is not just because the interests of some of us span both. They are two disciplines united by a common need to grapple with complex systems and communicate forecasts to a wide audience. It is not enough to explain only to experts. Much of the value of forecasts is in their being understood � in all their subtleties � by the general public, or at least sub-groups such as the agricultural industry in the case of meteorology and those involved in wage bargaining in the case of economics. The use or misuse of forecasts has caused problems for both the Bank of England and the Met Office in recent years. The Bank�s forecasts of inflation were criticised for overstating the size of confidence intervals during the period from 1995 to 2007, the so-called �Great Stability�, and then understating them once the financial crisis occurred. And the Met Office has recently announced that it will no longer publish forecasts for the weather in forthcoming seasons after it �failed� to predict the cold winter or the wet summer (in some parts of the country) last year. The seasonal forecasts will be replaced by monthly predictions. In a statement, the Met Office said, �by their nature, forecasts become less accurate the further out we look. Although we can identify general patterns of weather, the science does not exist to allow an exact forecast beyond five days, or to absolutely promise a certain type of   BIS Review 36/2010                                                                             1 weather�. But to publish forecasts only when the outcome is virtually certain would be an admission of at least partial defeat. If descriptions of probability distributions are misinterpreted by the media or the public, how can we discover which messages are robust and which are too fragile to survive the process of communication to a wide audience? First, we need to consider how we should form a view of the likelihood of different outcomes.   2.          Unpredictability in economics and science Unpredictability is a challenge faced by practitioners in many disciplines. As Kenneth Arrow, Nobel Laureate in Economics, said about his four-year experience as a weather officer in the US during World War II, �one thing I learned from meteorology is that being an actual science was no guarantee of exactness�. Economics may or may not be an actual science, but it certainly suffers when trying to predict the future. There are at least three explanations for this unpredictability that are common to economics and other scientific disciplines. First, assigning probabilities is particularly difficult for infrequent high-impact events such as financial crises, tsunamis, or climate change, for which there are few precedents. Because the samples of such events are so small, as we learn about these processes our assessment of their likelihood will change, possibly sharply. Second, even systems that are deterministic rather than stochastic can be very unpredictable. Small differences in starting conditions can imply very different outcomes. Weather systems display chaotic dynamics, so that small initial forecast errors may lead to large revisions to the forecast further out. Economists, in contrast, often rely on simple linear models, but with additive stochastic errors. In modelling any phenomenon there is a choice, and among the experts in the area often a live debate, about whether it is more useful to use deterministic but chaotic or stochastic models. 1 But the motivation in both cases is to bring out the importance of unpredictability. Another feature that hinders predictability is that a priori indistinguishable shocks can have very different effects in some systems. If you drop a grain of sand randomly on a sand pile, drop a lit match at random in a forest, or infect a random person with a disease, it may have very minimal, localised effects or may lead respectively to an avalanche, wildfire or epidemic. The outcome depends on the state of the system when the shock hits (the steepness of the sand pile, dryness of the forest, or density of the population) and the precise point at which the system is hit. 2 Third, systems can be subject to sudden transitions between locally stable states. In both economics and science, we can find examples of systems that have multiple stable states. And switches between these may be hard to predict. Models of the circulation pattern in the North Atlantic Ocean suggest that it can either be vigorous, helping to warm the northern hemisphere as water is transported from lower latitudes, or can shut down almost entirely. The magnetic properties of iron provide another example of a system with different stable states. When exposed temporarily to an external magnetic field, iron retains its magnetism even when the external field is removed: the same external conditions are consistent with    1      See, for example, Sugihara and May (1990). 2      In relation to the latter, key nodes or players may be instrumental in the spreading of shocks (Anderson and      May, 1991). This thinking has been applied to the financial system showing that a priori identical shocks can      have differing effects depending on where the shock hits. And, inspired by the literature on sand piles,      Scheinkman and Woodford�s (1994) model of inventory dynamics shows how small shocks may cause      aggregate fluctuations.    2                                                                                                 BIS Review 36/2010 different states of the system, depending on its history. 3 Many economic systems also exhibit forms of hysteresis or path dependence. For example, changing social attitudes towards personal bankruptcy, inflation or unemployment may affect equilibrium outcomes for those variables.   3.          Policy responses to unpredictability Predicting the precise timing and dynamics of instability in all of these settings is very difficult. It is, however, possible to identify a sand pile or forest as being prone to large scale instability and determine the factors that contribute to that instability. Analogously, many people, including at the Bank of England, did identify the vulnerabilities of the financial system before the crisis without actually being able to predict when or how the crisis would begin. Economists have been able to learn from other disciplines about how to cope with these types of instability. For example, insights from ecology and epidemiology have been applied to financial networks (for more discussion, see Haldane 2009), and economists have learned much from engineers about how to control dynamic systems. The key is for policymakers to focus on making the structure of the underlying system more robust to shocks. For example, in avalanche areas the snow may be �seeded� so that, by inducing small avalanches, the chance of a large avalanche is mitigated. And in fire-risk areas, controlled burns or fire breaks are sometimes used to limit the risk of a large fire. In the context of the financial system, policymakers could impose a �Glass-Steagall� style separation between the payments system network and risky activities. Actions can also be taken to mitigate the impact of a bad outcome. For example, this might mean building an avalanche net or fence; funding a fire-fighting service; or launching a lifeboat. In the context of financial regulation, this might entail reducing the costs associated with resolving financial institutions, for example by requiring banks to develop resolution and recovery plans, or requiring forced subsidiarisation of foreign bank branches. As always, however, there is the risk that such interventions can have unintended consequences: shortly after the Titanic sank, a steamer, the S.S. Eastland, capsized on Lake Michigan, with the loss of around 850 lives, because it had been destabilised by the extra lifeboats required by post-Titanic regulations!   4.          Decision making under uncertainty and the role of beliefs The analogies between economics and science can be taken only so far. A key difference between economics and the physical sciences is the role played by active decision-makers � such as households and businesses � whose presence complicates substantially the dynamics of the system. In particular, economic outcomes are sensitive to the way people behave under uncertainty, and to their beliefs about the past, present and future. Perceptions of uncertainty affect behaviour. If enough people are uncertain about their future job prospects and save more as a precaution, that may lead firms to cut employment, so increasing the chance that jobs are indeed lost. But uncertainty about whether it will rain today does not change the weather. Beliefs adapt over time in response to changes in the environment; and this in turn affect show economic systems behave. Because the surrounding environment can affect economic decision-making, there are probably few genuinely �deep� (and, therefore, stable) parameters   3      This particular example is fortuitous for earth science and biology, since it helps us date rocks and the fossils      they contain and chart continental drift, based on the history of changes in the magnetic field of the earth.    BIS Review 36/2010                                                                                                  3 or relationships in economics. In contrast, in many settings in the physical sciences there are stable �rules of the game� (e.g. the laws of gravity are as good an approximation one day as the next). The study of decision making under uncertainty has a distinguished ancestry in economics. Frank Knight (1921) wrote about the difference between risk (where frequencies could be used to calculate probabilities) and uncertainty (where there was no objective basis on which to derive probabilities). Of course, a true Bayesian would assume that people would be able to construct subjective probabilities, and their behaviour would be governed by those beliefs. But Keynes (1936) made much of the pervasive nature of uncertainty in his explanation of business cycles because of the instability of those subjective probabilities. Occasional sharp changes in expectations could, and did, result. That is exactly what happened in the Autumn of 2008, with the sudden and synchronous collapse in business confidence around the world. So the behaviour of economies depends in part upon the beliefs about future events held by the various players: consumers, businesses and governments. Outcomes are endogenous to beliefs about the likelihoods of the outcomes. And in some contexts there may be self- fulfilling equilibria. Sudden shifts in beliefs are particularly relevant when many decision-makers interact. The behaviour of a bank�s depositors has many equilibria, each of which depends upon beliefs about whether other depositors are likely to run on the bank. Changes in perceptions of uncertainty may be transmitted rapidly, and amplified, with the potential to affect behaviour in a coordinated way. 4 A restaurant may be much busier than an identical competitor if the first customers of the evening dine there and the next customers suspect the first may know something they don�t, and so follow, with others subsequently joining the herd. The reverse may occur on the following evening. Disentangling the incremental role of shifts in beliefs is often difficult. For example, afire sale of assets by one bank may have a mechanical amplifying impact on other banks through its effect on market prices, but could simultaneously affect other banks via confidence and beliefs, if people become less optimistic about valuations of other assets when one asset class is in distress. 5 The role of beliefs and behaviour in affecting outcomes means that there is a premium on understanding decision-making under uncertainty. In economics, broadly speaking there are two approaches to modelling decision making under uncertainty: the standard, �rational� approach of �homo economicus� which assumes that beliefs are based on an efficient processing of all available information, and the �behavioural� approach, informed by the psychology literature, which highlights psychological traits that violate the assumptions underlying the �rational� view. The two approaches yield different conclusions on both the desirability of policy intervention and the form it should take. In practice, the applicability of each approach depends on the context. Rationality may be a reasonable approximation when decisions are carefully considered (perhaps because the returns to a �good� decision are high). But behavioural economists and psychologists contend that people often make decisions using simple or �fast and frugal� heuristics because of limited time, information, and cognitive capacity (Gigerenzer and Todd 1999).   4     For example, Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2008) show how liquidity shocks in the presence of Knightian     uncertainty can cause investors to hoard liquid assets. This occurs because all firms assume a worst-case     scenario � that they will be unable to access liquidity when required � and this causes them to hoard liquidity.     Alternatively when information is dispersed across a large number of people, each with a noisy signal about     economic fundamentals, outcomes may be determined by an �information cascade�, the outcome of which is     hard to predict (Banerjee, 1992; Bikhchandani et al, 1992). 5     See May and Arinaminpathy (2010) for a model of the financial system which makes this distinction.    4                                                                                                  BIS Review 36/2010 There is strong experimental evidence that people are subject to biases when collecting and processing information under uncertainty, and that such processing occurs only intermittently. 6 The evidence suggests that people are also frequently incoherent in assessing, assigning and processing probabilities � even in highly artificial settings where information is complete � and find it particularly difficult to assess probabilities which are very low or very high, partly because there is less scope for learning in these cases. There is also evidence that, when making complex decisions or without full information, such as when deciding whether to have eye surgery, people often use rough heuristics, or go on first impressions, appearances, gut instinct or intuition. We want to highlight four main aspects of the behavioural view: (i)           Perceptions of risk have been shown to be unduly influenced by recent or personal               experience. After an earthquake, demand for earthquake insurance at first increases               and then declines, while the probability of the next large earthquake may grow over               time. 7 So-called �Depression babies� seem to take less financial risk than other               generations. 8 Such an effect may explain why the fear of financial crises declines               over time as memories of the last crisis fade. (ii)          Decisions under uncertainty have been shown to be sensitive to the way questions               are presented. People understand probabilities better if they are expressed in terms               of natural frequencies (1 in 10,000) rather than percentages (0.01%). This is one               symptom of a wider confusion over probabilistic concepts. Research by Gerd               Gigerenzer and others shows that doctors, for example, are often misled by               information presented in the form of probabilities rather than sample frequencies.               The statement that a diagnostic test has a 5% probability of a false positive is               misinterpreted more often than the statement that 5 patients out of every hundred               taking the test will show a false positive. 9 And this is compounded by the fact that               many forecasts are not of the kind where reference back to a sample frequency is               informative. Forecasts made today of the weather or the inflation rate at some date               in the future are unique; they are not the outcomes of a repeated experiment.               Decisions about saving for future pension provision, for example, are difficult to               make the subject of experimentation, although we can learn from the experience of               others. (iii)         People tend to follow the actions of others. That can be an effective strategy. For               example, on the game show �Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?�, the �Ask the               Audience� lifeline has a 91% success rate, showing that there can be wisdom in               crowds. 10 But experiments also show that a substantial proportion of people choose               a glaringly incorrect answer to a simple question when told it is the answer others               have chosen (even though the same question is answered correctly in isolation). 11               In a sporting setting, goalkeepers facing penalties tend to dive, rather than stay in               the middle of the goal, more than the direction of penalties suggests is               appropriate. 12 Such types of behaviour reflect the fact that people are unwilling to   6        See the collection of articles in Kahneman, D, Slovic, P and Tversky, A (1982). 7        For example, see Palm (1995). She found that those most affected by earthquakes were most likely to take        out insurance afterward. But this effect faded as time elapsed after an earthquake. 8        For example, Malmendier and Nagel (2006) report that those who experience high stock returns during their        life are more likely to hold stocks and report lower risk aversion; those who have experienced high inflation are        less likely to hold bonds. 9        See, for example, Gigerenzer, G and Edwards, A (2003). 10        See Surowiecki (2004). 11        See, for example, Asch (1951). 12        See Bar-Eli et al (2007).    BIS Review 36/2010                                                                                                    5             risk failure by pursuing strategies that are different from the norm. The penalty of             failure may be less if others fail in the same way � as Keynes pointed out was true             of banks. (iv)        People have excessive faith in their own judgements and are subject to confirmation             bias and wishful thinking. An experiment, well known in the literature, asked             respondents to report 90% confidence intervals around our estimates of a set of             unknown quantities (e.g. the diameter of the moon). 13 But the true answer lay             outside the reported confidence intervals half of the time. This reflects a general             result that people are overly confident in their own judgements. This effect suggests             that there may be a tendency to understate uncertainty and could explain why the             �severe� stress testing scenarios used by banks before the crisis were so mild.   5.          Policy implications These observations about decision making under uncertainty in economics have implications for policy along three dimensions. First, decision making under uncertainty affects the dynamics of the economy. Some of the psychological biases discussed above can offer an explanation for �herding� behaviour and �risk illusion� (a tendency to over/underestimate likelihoods of different type of events). Taken together, these biases could offer an explanation for periodic bouts of exuberance in the economy and the financial system in particular. 14 As such they should bear on our assessment of the likelihood of the range of possible outcomes. Our ignorance of how people behave under uncertainty, together with the presence of feedbacks between behaviour, outturns and beliefs, highlights some of the difficulties and pitfalls of economic policy making. Second, the recognition that beliefs and behaviour play an important role in the dynamics of the system affects the type of policy actions that are desirable. Ensuring that panic did not spread is one reason why guaranteeing all bank deposits following the run on Northern Rock in September 2007 was necessary. Third, communication is part of the policy response to uncertainty. In this respect, economic and financial systems differ from physical systems. In the latter, there is no-one listening. The control strategy in a physical system is defined by a scheme that relates the settings of policy instruments to certain features of the environment (e.g. fire left booster rocket if rocket veers to left of target). But in an economic system � because people�s beliefs about future policy actions affect their behaviour today � the control strategy has to comprise not only a plan for setting the instruments (e.g. raise Bank Rate if expected inflation rises) but also a plan to condition beliefs about how policy makers would respond in future. That involves communication.   6.          Communication A communication strategy involves deciding how much information to communicate, and in what form. Revealing information entails costs and benefits. An optimal communication strategy balances those costs and benefits. Consider first the benefits. Information is valuable and can improve the quality of decisions. Many government agencies have valuable information that private citizens cannot easily   13      See Plous (1993). 14      Tucker (2009) discusses how this might create a friction that could be countered through the use of so-called      macroprudential instruments.    6                                                                                                 BIS Review 36/2010 obtain for themselves. An example is the information collected by the Office for National Statistics on the economy and social trends. Central banks, too, may have information about the shocks hitting the economy, or about how they will be propagated, or indeed about the way in which policy is likely to respond. Provision of information about these issues may help people to reduce their forecast errors and take more informed decisions. As we discussed earlier, complex economic systems may have multiple equilibria. Movements between them depend on expectations and beliefs about others� beliefs. That is especially so if there are strategic complementarities where the benefits of a strategy depend on the choice of strategies by others. Communication might help to coordinate beliefs so that a good rather than bad equilibrium results. Suppose that private investors begin to doubt the health of a bank which the central bank knows to be fundamentally solvent. A signal from the central bank that the bank is solvent may help to change beliefs, thus ensuring the continued liquidity and hence solvency of the healthy bank. But it may not be clear that the bank is solvent, and in practice there is often no smoke without fire. Communication may help to improve the credibility of public policy. Economic policymakers often confront the problem that a future policy setting that is optimal today is not likely to be the policy that it would be optimal to follow tomorrow. Before central bank independence, a problem for monetary policy was that a government promise to deliver low inflation was not credible. Wage and price setters knew that if contracts were based on the assumption that future inflation would be low, the government would not be able to resist the temptation to generate inflation higher than promised because that would temporarily boost employment and output. So the initial promise was not believed. Once expectations of high inflation were embedded into prices and wages, it was at that point rational for the government to tolerate high inflation, because the cost of reducing it would be a deep recession. The idea of giving central banks independent control over monetary policy was to remove this temptation to inflate. 15 Communication is a potential solution to the credibility problem. If policymakers are transparent about the objectives of a policy � and the strategy to be followed in pursuit of those objectives � it will be easier to hold them accountable for their actions. This increases the incentives for policy makers to meet their objectives. Despite all these benefits, it does not always follow that more communication is beneficial. More communication can be costly and self-defeating. First, private participants face costs in collecting and processing information that could mean important messages are lost. The Bank of England could publish all of the many documents which it creates internally each month. But that would simply make it harder for the really important information to get through. Less can be more. We could have minute by minute revisions to weather forecasts or terrorism threat estimates, but that might overwhelm genuine flood or bomb warnings to which we want people to respond. 16 Second, communication can sometimes aggravate market failures. Suppose the RSPB knows a secret location where rare birds are nesting. To preserve biodiversity, there may be a great benefit to ensuring the birds can nest undisturbed. If the RSPB reveals its secret, bird watchers may converge on the location. Here, less than full transparency mitigates the problem. An example in the same spirit is whether or not use by commercial banks of the Bank of England�s lending facilities should be concealed. If use of the facility were made public,   15      For an exposition of the credibility problem in monetary policy, see Kydland and Prescott (1977); for an      account of the benefits of central bank independence, see Fischer (1994). 16      This idea has received theoretical attention recently following the encouragement of Sims (2003). He sketches      a model in which agents are �rationally inattentive�, focusing only on information which they diagnose makes      an important contribution to minimising forecast errors.    BIS Review 36/2010                                                                                              7 depositors would ask themselves why it had been used: if they attached even a small probability to the possibility that the bank was in trouble, it would be rational for them to withdraw their deposits � triggering a run on the bank. Anticipating this reaction, there is a risk that banks would choose not to use the facilities. Further, some market participants might use the information that the facilities were being used to spread malicious rumours in the hope of profiting from the market reaction. Such rumour-spreading would be privately beneficial for the rumour-spreaders, but socially harmful. That is why when designing its discount window lending facilities, the Bank decided only to disclose average usage over a quarter, and then only with a lag. 17 Communication of forecasts is not easy. Probabilities are hard to understand. Yet a forecast is not a number but an estimated probability distribution. 18 And we cannot assume that people obtain information in a neutral form. Indeed for most people information is conveyed to them via the media which may filter out or reinterpret information. This leads to an incentive problem. Instead of simply reporting the information about future prospects made available in the forecasts, there is an incentive to summarise the prospects in a single number or to describe one part of the probability distribution in a way that makes for a good story. That suggests there is merit in trying to communicate directly to the public. Forecasts, or probabilistic statements in general, can easily be misunderstood or misinterpreted. As a result, forecasters may decide to withhold information, even when, correctly understood, there is something useful in the forecast � a case in point being the recent Met Office withdrawal of medium term seasonal forecasts. When experts retire from the field, it is left wide open to quackery � and there is no shortage of quacks whether in medicine, economics or meteorology. So there is a major challenge in explaining that, although we may not have a precise prediction of the effects of a particular policy action, nor are we wholly ignorant of its consequences. Finding illuminating ways of expressing those judgements is difficult but important. We must not pretend to know more than we do, and we must avoid the delusion of spurious precision.   7.          Communication in practice: fan charts It is time to put some flesh on the bones of these abstract discussions. It is time in fact for a show � a slide show of the graphical representation of the uncertainty about future inflation which the Bank of England uses to communicate its views about the outlook. The Bank of England publishes a range of documents which describe the uncertainty about our analysis of the economy, and hence the uncertainty inherent in setting policy. Our longest-running, and perhaps the best known, is the quarterly Inflation Report, which the Bank has been producing since 1993. In it, the Monetary Policy Committee communicates its views about an uncertain future using methods that draw on the ideas discussed above. In the Inflation Report, the MPC sets out its latest projections for key economic variables. The most important of these is the projection for inflation. The Committee has a clear   17      Morris and Shin (2002) study a case in which a central bank can only reveal a noisy signal. That signal, which      is unavoidably inaccurate (e.g. a central bank forecast), is given an inappropriately high weight in private      decisions because each private participant expects others to use it, and each wants to ensure that his action      is not too far out of line with others�. This is an example where a public communication coordinates on an      inferior equilibrium. Morris and Shin also show that public information can crowd out private information. By      ensuring that all agents overweight public information in their decisions, that means th"
2010-06-21	"Mervyn King: Monetary policy developments Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Lord Mayor�s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London, London, 16 June 2010.                                            *    *    *  My Lord Mayor, Mr Chancellor, My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen, May I join the Lord Mayor in welcoming you, Chancellor, to your first Mansion House Dinner? You have set a rapid pace in your first month in office, not least in your announcements this evening. In previous years I have sometimes set this gathering a quiz question. Tonight I want to reverse the process by providing the answer and asking you for the question. The answer is 23, and later I shall ask you � to what question is 23 the answer? Over the past year, there has been no slackening in the pace of economic and political upheaval. The financial crisis that began in 2007 is not yet over. Much of the recent market volatility reflects concerns about the ability of governments to service their own debt and provide assistance where necessary to weakened banking systems, especially in the euro area. Such risks have the potential to derail recovery and we cannot ignore them. At home we face the challenge of ensuring recovery while rebalancing the economy, reducing the fiscal deficit, and reshaping the structure and regulation of our banking system. In playing its part to meet this challenge, the Bank of England has two priorities. Our first priority must be to maintain low and stable inflation. Of late there have been those who doubt our ability or willingness to meet the inflation target. In May, CPI inflation was 3.4%, and for much of the past three years has been above the 2% target. Over that period the rise in prices in excess of that implied by the target was around 3%. That can be accounted for by the direct impact on the price level of the fall in sterling�s effective exchange rate, of about 25%, which is supporting the rebalancing of the UK economy. Inflation has not only been higher than in the previous decade; it has also been more volatile. Our ability to keep measured inflation close to the target has been hindered by movements in world oil and commodity prices, as well as the temporary reduction in VAT. Oil prices, for example, have gyrated between $40 and $150 a barrel. Although such price changes clearly lead to higher or lower CPI inflation for a period, by themselves they do not generate the continuous rise in prices to which monetary policy should respond. A continuous rise in prices would ordinarily be associated with strong money growth, wage inflation, rapid increases in money spending and an excess of demand over the supply capacity of the economy. The UK economy exhibits none of these traits � annual broad money growth is around 1%, growth in regular pay is close to 2% and money spending growth is around 3%; all of which are significantly lower than the average growth rates recorded before the crisis. And a range of indicators point to spare capacity in the economy rather than excess demand. Perhaps most obviously, unemployment is around 8%, three percentage points above the average levels before the crisis � a million fewer people in work. The Monetary Policy Committee judges that it is likely, though not certain, that this spare capacity will press down on inflation. That seems to be happening in both the United States and the euro area where underlying inflation is falling. No one should take this as a sign of complacency. The MPC is conscious that there are always risks to the upside, and the apparent rise in inflation expectations is one that concerns us. We have always explicitly recognised that there is a significant chance that inflation may turn out to be above target. A forecast is not a single number; it is an assessment of risks. In our May forecast, the MPC judged that, under prevailing market interest rates, the odds were in favour of inflation remaining above target over the next year,   BIS Review 84/2010                                                                             1 whereas, looking two to three years ahead, the odds were on inflation being below the target. There are always risks to the outlook � on both sides � and to ignore them in either direction would be foolish. What the MPC must do is continually update its assessment of those risks, and set policy in order that, on balance, inflation remains on track to meet the target in the medium term. No one should doubt our determination to meet the target. The inflation target introduced in 1992, and the new regime for monetary policy decision-making introduced in 1997, have shown beyond doubt that monetary policy in the United Kingdom is dedicated to maintaining low and stable inflation. Indeed, for ten years, I was, to my frustration, regularly described as a hawk. But I am neither hawk nor dove. Everyone on the Committee votes according to his or her judgement of the outlook for the economy. I have not changed. The Committee has not changed. Circumstances have changed. When confidence, output and trade around the world collapsed in the autumn of 2008, the balance of threats to the inflation outlook shifted rapidly to the downside. So the Bank of England and central banks in other industrialised countries responded by reducing official interest rates nearly to zero and injecting money directly into the economy. There will come a time when our task will be to manage the exit from such an abnormal degree of monetary stimulus. The MPC will not hesitate to begin to withdraw the current degree of stimulus when we judge that is necessary. When it comes, that is most likely to be through a rise in Bank Rate with asset sales being conducted later in an orderly programme over a period of time, leaving Bank Rate as the active instrument. But monetary policy must be set in the light of the fiscal tightening over the coming years, the continuing fragility in financial markets and the state of the banking system. I know there are those who worry that too rapid a fiscal consolidation will endanger recovery. But the steady reduction in the very large structural deficit over a period of a parliament cannot credibly be postponed indefinitely. If prospects for growth were to weaken, the outlook for inflation would probably be lower and monetary policy could then respond. I do, therefore, Chancellor welcome your commitment to put the UK�s public finances on a sound footing. It is important that, in the medium term, national debt as a proportion of GDP returns to a declining path. At the same time, it is important, however, that we work with our partners overseas to reduce the global imbalances and promote an adequate level of world growth. Countries with large current account and budget deficits will need to pursue both fiscal consolidation and policies to improve their competitiveness. And countries with current account surpluses, while understandably wanting to avoid unsustainable fiscal paths of their own, have a responsibility to expand domestic demand so that the imbalances can be reduced. Only if the two sets of policies work in tandem will growth prove sustainable. Our second priority is to accept the challenge of the new responsibilities that you, Chancellor, have asked the Bank to take on in respect of micro prudential regulation and macro prudential control of the balance sheets of the financial system as a whole. I welcome those new responsibilities. Monetary stability and financial stability are two sides of the same coin. During the crisis the former was threatened by the failure to secure the latter. The experience of the financial crisis taught us two important lessons. The first is that, whatever its theoretical attractions � and there certainly are some � putting prudential regulation into the same organisation as the oversight of consumer protection and market conduct didn�t work in practice. The two types of regulation require different skills and a different approach. Separating them � the so-called �twin peaks� model of financial regulation � is the right direction of reform. That conclusion is not a reflection on the people who work at FSA. They are an able group and have worked hard to improve prudential regulation over the past three years. I look forward to working with them in the future. Nor does it follow from this first lesson that prudential regulation should necessarily go to the central bank.     2                                                                                  BIS Review 84/2010 But a second lesson is that when banks hit trouble the central bank needs to be fully involved in resolving those problems. The Bank of England cannot effectively perform its role as lender of last resort without first-hand knowledge of the health of the banks to which it might provide support. In peacetime, regulation can be conducted outside the central bank. But in a crisis, decisions must be made quickly and decisively and the central bank, working with government which is always responsible for any use of public money, needs to be in charge. That was one of our painful lessons. In approaching our new responsibilities we shall build on the real improvements to its regime of prudential regulation made over the past three years by FSA. But the Bank will bring its own central banking culture. The focus of regulation needs to be on maintaining stability of the banking system as a whole. We shall be looking not just at those aspects of a bank that make it look unsafe in comparison with other institutions, but even more so at whether there are common features that threaten the stability of the system, such as the dangerously high leverage prior to 2007. We shall aim to avoid an overly legalistic culture with its associated compliance-driven style of regulation. That is an important reason for the separation of consumer protection and market conduct from prudential regulation. We will need to exercise discretion when setting capital and liquidity ratios for individual banks. And to do that properly will require changes to the current legislation and rule book. We must reverse the seemingly inexorable trend towards more regulation and more regulators. That did not work in the past and is not the right response now. I am absolutely delighted that Hector Sants has agreed to remain at FSA and then move to the Bank to become the first chief executive of the new prudential regulator. In difficult circumstances, Hector has engineered major improvements to FSA�s prudential regulation. Andrew Bailey will head the Bank�s transition team and will be the first deputy chief executive of the prudential authority. Together, Hector and Andrew form the perfect partnership to make the transition work and create the new organisation. In the new regime, regulation will reflect two different, though complementary, perspectives. The first, as now, is a bottom-up perspective, focused on setting institution-specific capital requirements. Those would be fixed requirements that banks could not breach. The second is an overall perspective with a set of system-wide capital requirements that vary over the economic cycle. Judgements on the level of these capital buffers will be part of the remit of the new Financial Policy Committee. The prudential regulator, with its micro prudential responsibilities, and the Financial Policy Committee, with its macro prudential responsibilities, will need to work closely together, and that is one reason why it is sensible that they are both in the central bank. It is not difficult to see what role such a macro prudential regime might have played in the run-up to the crisis. A progressive tightening of capital standards, for example, would have helped rein in the near-tripling of UK bank balance sheets between 2002 and 2007. The Bank�s sermons on the storms ahead would have had more influence if at the same time a collection plate was passed round the congregation so that money was available in the event that the church roof had to be replaced. But a macro prudential regime also has a key role to play in the downswing phase of the cycle. Since 2008, credit conditions have tightened, jeopardising the recovery and, in turn, threatening renewed losses for banks. By allowing banks to draw on their macro prudential capital buffers, while credit conditions remain tight, the system is counter-cyclical. In other words, a credible macro prudential regime could help forestall both excessive exuberance and unnecessary caution. By altering the pressure on the financial brakes according to circumstances, regulation, far from being an inflexible foe, would become a flexible friend. This type of regulatory regime, and its objectives and tools, are largely untried and untested. But that is not a reason for not trying and not testing. The Financial Policy Committee will be a first. Over the next few years we will put in place a framework for financial stability to   BIS Review 84/2010                                                                              3 parallel that for monetary stability. We need both. As we have seen, one without the other is not enough. Just as the role of a central bank in monetary policy is to take the punch bowl away just as the party gets going, its role in financial stability should be to turn down the music when the dancing gets a little too wild. Still, we should not put all our faith in regulation. It has limits. If the structure of banking creates incentives to take excessive risk then regulators will be overwhelmed by the avarice so vividly captured by Michael Lewis in his book The Big Short. Incentives must be right. One misalignment of incentives today is the implicit guarantee to banks that are �too important to fail�, so that creditors have little incentive to monitor the behaviour of banks because they believe they will be bailed out. This problem is too important to ignore. There is no one simple solution. But we should not shy away from radical reform just because of the opposition of vested interests. So I welcome the setting up of the Banking Commission, with its talented commissioners and a wise and forensic chairman in Sir John Vickers. Let me now return to the quiz question I posed earlier � to what question is 23 the answer? Several plausible answers come to mind. First, 23 is the number of players in England�s World Cup squad in South Africa. Second, it is of course 23 years since England last won the Ashes �down under�. But neither of these are the right answer which is that 23 years is the age difference between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England. In case there is any doubt, George is the younger. This age difference is highly desirable because the appropriate incentives are to allocate the responsibility of determining monetary policy to the older generation, which has a real interest in preserving the value of money, and the responsibility for fiscal policy to the younger generation, on whom falls the burden of excessive debt. If we are tempted to leave a large burden of debt for the next generation to pay back, what better incentive mechanism than to have as Chancellor someone who has a longer life expectancy than any previous Chancellor on record? Given those incentives, Chancellor, I look forward to a harmonious coordination of monetary and fiscal policy. Lord Mayor, as we prepare to toast the Bankers and Merchants of the City of London, all of us here tonight would like to pay tribute to your charitable work since you became Lord Mayor. This year the Lord Mayor�s charity �Pitch Perfect� is focussed on two educational charities in which I have a special personal interest � the educational work of the London Symphony Orchestra and Chance to shine, the campaign to regenerate cricket in state schools which, in five years, has already brought the opportunity to play competitive matches to more than one million children, over 40% of whom are girls. Your personal commitment Nick to support these causes in times of great financial difficulty is a tribute to you and also to the charitable instincts of the City of London. We thank you for that work, and I am sure that everyone here tonight thanks both you and the Lady Mayoress for the splendid hospitality which you have extended to us all this evening. So I invite you all to rise and join me in the traditional toast of good health and prosperity to �The Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress�, Nick and Claire Anstee.     4                                                                                    BIS Review 84/2010"
2010-09-17	"Mervyn King: Address by Mervyn King to Trades Union Congress Address by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, to the 2010 Trades Union Congress, Manchester, 15 September 2010.                                           *    *    *  President and Congress I want first to thank you for inviting me to address Congress. Members of your General Council have made a huge contribution to the Bank of England by serving on our board � the Bank�s Court. Carrying on that tradition today is Brendan Barber. By bringing a distinct and important perspective to our discussions, Brendan has helped us through some extremely turbulent times. I am grateful to him. Recent times have indeed been turbulent. After a decade and a half of stability, with rising employment and living standards, came the crisis and recession � the biggest economic upheaval since the Great Depression. Before the crisis, steady growth with low inflation and high employment was in our grasp. We let it slip � we, that is, in the financial sector and as policy-makers � not your members nor the many businesses and organisations around the country which employ them. And although the causes of the crisis may have been rooted in the financial sector, the consequences are affecting everyone, and will continue to do so for years to come. Thankfully, the costs of the crisis have been smaller than those of the Great Depression. But only because we learnt from that experience. An unprecedented degree of policy stimulus, here and abroad, prevented another world slump. Even so, around a million more people in Britain are out of work than before the crisis. Many, especially the young unemployed, have had their futures blighted. So we cannot just carry on as we are. Unless we reform our economy � rebalance demand, restructure banking, and restore the sustainability of our public finances � we shall not only jeopardise recovery, but also fail the next generation. To my mind, a market economy and its disciplines offer the best way of raising living standards. But a market economy cannot survive on incentives alone. It must align those incentives to the common good. It must command support among the vast majority who do not receive the large rewards that accrue to the successful and the lucky. And it must show a sense of fairness if its efficiency is to yield fruit. There was nothing fair about the financial crisis. It was caused not by problems in the real economy; it came out of the financial sector. But it was the real economy that suffered and the banks that were bailed out. Your members, and indeed the businesses which employ them, are entitled to be angry. But however legitimate, anger will not produce change unless its energy is harnessed to a cool analysis of what happened and why. So I want to discuss the fundamental causes of the crisis before turning to current policy. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 changed both politics and economics. Within a few years, the former Soviet empire, China and other Asian economies, with their combined workforce of over a billion people, entered the world trading system as market economies. Their focus on export-led growth allowed consumers in the West to enjoy rising living standards as the prices of traded goods fell. But the trade surpluses in emerging economies implied an outflow of capital. Relatively poor countries were lending money to richer western ones � the reverse of the traditional model of development. In the process, countries like China built up huge holdings of foreign assets � running into trillions of dollars � matched by equally huge debts in the deficit countries. Such massive imbalances were never likely to be sustainable, and so it proved. If the first fundamental cause of the crisis was the scale of imbalances in the world economy, the second was the inability of our banking system to absorb such large inflows of capital   BIS Review 117/2010                                                                          1 without taking excessive risk. In the five years leading up to the crisis, the balance sheets of the West�s largest banks doubled � mainly because banks lent more to other firms within the financial sector than to the wider economy. And the proportion of capital held by banks shrank so that their leverage � the ratio of total liabilities to equity capital � rose to unprecedented levels. Immediately prior to the crisis, the leverage ratios of some UK banks approached 50. To say that was risky is an understatement: at such levels, a 2% fall in the value of a bank�s assets is sufficient to wipe out its capital and render it insolvent. Remuneration, especially the structure of financial sector bonuses, encouraged excessive risk-taking, and distorted the aspirations and career choices of too many talented young people. Investors, banks and regulators had been swept up by the apparent success of modern finance. When investors realised that many of the assets that banks held on their balance sheets were opaque and hard to value, there was immediate and justifiable concern about the solvency of many of those banks. At the end of 2008, these two fundamental factors culminated in the worst financial crisis in history. In the six months after Lehman Brothers collapsed world trade fell by nearly 20% � a faster decline than in the Great Depression. Around the world, the same telling phrase was repeated: economic activity was �falling off a cliff�. In its statement to the London G20 summit in April 2009, the international trade union movement argued that �The first priority for G20 leaders must be to restore confidence by halting the freefall in world growth�. That has been achieved. World output grew by 4% over the past year. And in the United Kingdom, growth has been somewhat faster than anticipated a year ago. Nevertheless, total UK output remains around 10% below where it would have been had the crisis not occurred. So how do we prevent this happening again? If we are to prevent another crisis, action is required on both of the fundamental causes. First, we need to resolve the problems caused by massive capital flows from poor to rich countries. Yet the imbalances are growing again. This problem can be tackled only by international cooperation � most obviously through the G20 � and I hope that the trade union movement will continue to engage with that process. Second, our financial system needs radical reform. Slowly but surely, we must move towards a banking system that does not put both the economy and your members� livelihoods at risk. In the long run, banks will have to hold much more capital and be much less highly leveraged. Part of the answer is improving the way we regulate banks, and devising policy tools to control the risks taken by the financial system as a whole. The aim should not be to prevent all bank failures. Just as with every other company in the economy, banks that get it wrong must be allowed to fail, without risk to ordinary depositors or taxpayers. In 2008, banks were bailed out not to protect them but to protect the rest of the economy from the banks. That may not seem fair � and it isn�t � when other companies, such as Jaguar, had to stand on their own feet or go to the wall. So banks too must face market discipline. But we need to do more than reform our banking system. If the world economy needs rebalancing, so does our own. The substantial trade deficit over a number of years means that national spending exceeded production. We need a higher national saving rate, a shift in spending and production away from consumption and towards exports. And a key part of that is a reduction in our budget deficit. There is a perfectly reasonable debate about the precise speed at which to reduce the deficit. Indeed, I supported the extra fiscal stimulus to the economy provided in the immediate wake of the crisis. And there is a further question about how the deficit should be reduced � the balance between raising taxes and cutting spending. That is not for me to say; that is for you and the politicians to debate. But it is indisputable that, because of the crisis, national income is 10% lower than was expected with a damaging impact on tax revenues. As a result, this country has the largest peacetime budget deficit in its history � over 11% of GDP in the fiscal year to 2010. Although a large budget deficit is inevitable for a period after a crisis, it is also clearly unsustainable � our national debt, even relative to GDP, is rising sharply and will continue to do so for several years. It is vital for any government to set out   2                                                                                  BIS Review 117/2010 and commit to a clear and credible plan for reducing the deficit. I would be shirking my responsibilities if I did not explain to you the risks of failing to do so. Vague promises would not have been enough. Market reaction to rising sovereign debt can turn quickly from benign to malign, as we saw in the euro area earlier this year. It is not sensible to risk a damaging rise in long-term interest rates that would make investment and the cost of mortgages more expensive. The current plan is to reduce the deficit steadily over five years � a more gradual fiscal tightening than in some other countries. As a result of a failure to put such a plan in place sooner, some euro-area countries have found � to their cost � a much more rapid adjustment being forced upon them. Of course, no one can forecast the gusts � or indeed storms � the economy may face looking ahead. But if the recovery is slower than expected then the automatic fiscal stabilisers � the lower tax receipts and higher spending that result from weaker growth � will act to stimulate demand. And monetary policy can react too, especially when there is a credible plan to reduce the deficit. In the wake of the worst financial crisis ever, the amount of money in our economy � broad money � is now barely growing at all. It was the failure in the 1930s to halt a marked contraction in the money supply that led to the Great Depression. So the Bank of England has taken extraordinary measures � described as �quantitative easing� � to boost the supply of money in order to support a recovery in the economy and keep inflation on track to meet our target. And because monetary policy is a flexible instrument that can be changed in either direction each month, it is the best tool for managing the economy in the short run. Nevertheless, the road ahead is unlikely to be straight. There is considerable uncertainty about the prospects for both the United States and the euro area � our most important export markets. Business and consumer confidence at home has weakened recently, and it will be some time before our banking sector is able to finance a recovery on the usual terms. The transition to a better balanced economy will be difficult. But we are already seeing encouraging signs of expansion in manufacturing and UK exports. This morning�s figures show a small rise in the claimant count and a small fall in the Labour Force Survey measures of unemployment. But the big picture is that unemployment is higher than before the crisis but lower than many had feared a year ago. In July, on one of my regular visits to different parts of the country, I met with the Scottish TUC in Glasgow to learn more about the labour market there. Our contacts with experienced union officials in touch with a range of companies and sectors are the best source of intelligence on labour markets. With your help, we are determined to understand what is happening in every region and country of our economy so that we can set the right monetary policy. I want to assure you that the Bank of England is there to serve the whole economy, right across the length and breadth of this country. The costs of this crisis will be with us for a generation. And we owe it to the next generation to seize this opportunity to put in place the reforms that will make another crisis much less likely and much less damaging. We at the Bank of England and you in the trade union movement should work together. That is why I am pleased to be with you today. It will require patience and determination on all our parts, including your members. But the prize of restoring and maintaining economic stability � and a return to sustained rises in employment and living standards � will be worth the effort.

2010-10-21	Mervyn King: Changes in the UK economy and the role the Bank of England can play in supporting them Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Black Country Chamber of Commerce, West Midlands, 19 October 2010.                                             *    *   *  Ladies and Gentlemen, It is good to be back in the heart of Britain � in the Black Country � because the Bank of England has strong connections with the area. Both I and Deputy Governor Paul Tucker hail from Wolverhampton. And I am delighted that all nine members of the Bank�s Monetary Policy Committee are in the West Midlands this week on an MPC road-show to see for themselves the state of business in the region. The Black Country is the home of the original Industrial Revolution. Too often those historic events are painted as just that � past glories of little relevance today. But there is no better place to see evidence of how the British economy can adapt than in the Black Country. Indeed, one example can be found behind this building. Dudley Canal No. 1 was part of a network of canals, central to the Industrial Revolution, along which the products made here � especially iron and steel � were transported throughout the country. At its peak, there were 5,000 miles of canals in Britain. Of course, the importance of canals as the arteries of industry later declined and by the late 1960s only 2,775 miles were navigable. But the regeneration of urban communities, and the efforts of British Waterways, have reversed this decline. The number of miles is now increasing. Last year, 13 million people visited our canals and the number of boats is actually higher now than during the Industrial Revolution. Such examples are important because our economy faces the prospect of change again. After an unprecedented financial crisis and deep recession, the UK economy needs to rebalance. Tonight I want to talk about what those changes will entail and the role which the Bank of England can play in supporting them. The Bank of England�s key role has always been to ensure that the economy is supplied with the right quantity of money � neither too much nor too little. For fifty years, my predecessors struggled to prevent there being too much, so leading to inflation. I find myself in the opposite situation having to explain that there is too little money in the economy. But, in the wake of the financial crisis, and the sharp downturn that followed, the amount of money in the economy as a whole � broad money � is now barely growing at all. That is restraining activity and pushing down the outlook for inflation. So the Bank of England has taken extraordinary monetary policy measures � through our so-called �quantitative easing� programme of asset purchases � to ensure that the amount of money starts growing again in order to support a recovery and keep inflation on track to meet our target in the medium term. My first speech as Governor � in 2003 � was also in the Midlands. In it, I talked about the non-inflationary consistently expansionary � or �nice� � decade from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. I argued that the next decade was unlikely to be as nice because, and I quote, �when shocks, as they will, hit our economy it is almost inevitable that there will be somewhat greater volatility of both output and inflation than the remarkable stability to which we have become used in recent years�. I certainly did not anticipate the scale of the downturn in the world economy that followed the collapse of the banking system in 2008. But I did point to the need for a rebalancing of demand in the UK economy because, as I said then, �the strategy which the MPC has pursued in recent years � stimulating domestic demand to compensate for weak external demand in the face of a strong exchange rate � carries the risk that there could be a sharp correction to the level of consumer spending at some point in the future�.     BIS Review 136/2010                                                                            1 The counterpart to strong consumption in the past was low saving. Having averaged close to 20% in the 1960s and 70s, gross national savings fell to just 12% of income in 2009 � the lowest since the War. This was all the more remarkable because one might have expected saving to increase as life expectancy rose. In the coming years, we will have to save more, even though the immediate concern is to ensure a recovery in demand. So the case for rebalancing is even stronger in the wake of the financial crisis and recession that followed the nice decade. To achieve a rebalancing we need to sell more to, and buy less from, economies overseas. To close the gap between exports and imports, more than half a million jobs will probably need to be created in businesses producing to sell overseas � compensating for fewer employment opportunities serving UK consumers or the public sector. Such an adjustment is unlikely to be smooth. Unless the fall in domestic spending coincides with the necessary increase in net exports, the path for the economy will be bumpy. As a result, it is dangerous to become fixated by the precise profile of quarterly growth rates. The sensible approach is to focus on the big picture. And the big picture is that total output is roughly 10% below where it would have been had the crisis not occurred. The conditions are in place to support a rebalancing at home: in particular the past depreciation of sterling will make UK-produced goods more competitive at home and abroad. But domestic spending has already fallen before a pickup in net exports. This highlights a key role for monetary policy: smoothing the adjustment process by providing temporary stimulus to demand while the rebalancing takes place, so reducing the risk of inflation falling below the target in the medium term. The biggest risk to an orderly rebalancing of our economy comes from abroad. Efforts to restore world demand are impeded by the scale of the imbalances in trade, which are beginning to grow again. If the UK and other low-savings countries are to rebalance their economies, demand for their products must increase overseas. Lower domestic demand in the deficit countries must be accompanied by strong growth in domestic demand in the surplus countries if the world economy is not to slow. That will require a change in the strategy of those countries that have built their own policies around export-led growth. In searching for a solution, some ask who is to blame. But that misses the point. Before the crisis, all the main players were rationally pursuing their own perceived self-interest. Policymakers in countries like China wanted to develop via an export-led strategy, and policymakers in the low-saving countries took actions to maintain an adequate level of overall demand, consistent with steady, low inflation. But what seemed to make sense for each player individually did not make sense in aggregate, and we can see the consequences. A key lesson from the crisis is that we must find better ways of ensuring the right collective outcome. That challenge is clearly visible today. All countries accept that global rebalancing is necessary. But there is a clear difference between the path of adjustment desired by the surplus countries, which are faced with the need for a longer-term structural shift away from reliance on exports, and the path of adjustment preferred by the deficit countries, which are under greater near-term pressure to reduce the burden of debt in both private and public sectors. Tensions between the two groups were evident at last week�s IMF meetings in Washington where all the talk was of currency conflicts. Such conflicts are, however, symptoms of a deeper disagreement on the appropriate time path of real adjustment. Since surpluses and deficits must add to zero for the world as a whole, differences between these desired ex ante adjustment paths are reconciled ex post by changes in the level of world output. And the risk is that unless agreement on a common path of adjustment is reached, conflicting policies will result in an undesirably low level of world output, with all countries worse off as a result. The international monetary system today has become distorted. The major surplus and deficit countries are pursuing economic strategies that are in direct conflict. And there are   2                                                                                BIS Review 136/2010 some innocent victims. Those emerging market economies which have adopted floating currencies are now suffering from the attempts of other countries to hold down their exchange rates, and are experiencing uncomfortable rates of capital inflows and currency appreciation. So there is more to this issue than a bilateral conflict between China and the United States. At the G7 meeting in October 2008, I was part of the group of ministers and central bank governors who threw away the prepared communiqu�, and replaced it by a bold short statement of our determination to work together. That spirit, so strong then, has ebbed away. Current exchange rate tensions illustrate the resistance to the relative price changes that are necessary for a successful rebalancing. The need to act in the collective interest has yet to be recognised, and, unless it is, it will be only a matter of time before one or more countries resort to trade protectionism as the only domestic instrument to support a necessary rebalancing. That could, as it did in the 1930s, lead to a disastrous collapse in activity around the world. Every country would suffer ruinous consequences � including our own. But, to borrow a phrase, in order to be tough on protectionism, we need also to be tough on the causes of protectionism. So what needs to be done? Let me suggest two principles for the way ahead. First, focus discussion on the underlying disagreement about the right speed of adjustment to the real pattern of spending. Without agreement on this, policies will inevitably conflict. Once broad agreement is reached, it should be easier to agree on the instruments of policy. Second, in terms of policy instruments, put on the table many potential policy measures � not just the single issue of exchange rates. That should include, in addition to exchange rates, rules of the game for controlling capital inflows, plans to raise saving in the deficit countries, structural reforms to boost demand in the surplus countries, and even the role and governance of the international financial institutions. What is needed now is a �grand bargain� among the major players in the world economy. A bargain that recognises the benefits of compromise on the real path of economic adjustment in order to avoid the damaging consequences of a move towards protectionism. Exchange rates will have to be part of such a bargain, but they logically follow a higher level agreement on rebalancing and sustaining a high level of world demand. A natural forum in which to strike such a bargain is the G20. But to turn the regular round of international meetings into a real agreement will require a revolution, different in nature but no less significant, than that which put the Black Country on the map. Landlocked though the Black Country may be, our local economy has always been linked to a wider world � by canal, rail, road, and air, even fibre-optic cable. So the manner and speed with which the global imbalances unwind will have a direct impact on the Black Country and the UK economy as a whole. Such developments in the real economy are important also for the Monetary Policy Committee, because they are an important influence on our primary goal of ensuring inflation is on track to meet our 2% inflation target. Recently, inflation has been high and volatile. It is currently above our 2% target. And the aim of the MPC is to bring it down. But as demand rebalances, we should expect some volatility in inflation as well as in the path of output. During 2008, CPI inflation rose to a peak of 5.2%, fell to a low of 1.1% in 2009, before increasing again to stand at 3.1% now. Those movements have mainly reflected changes in VAT, volatile energy prices and pass-through from the past exchange rate depreciation. Together they have pushed up on measured inflation. Though uncomfortable, it is not surprising that inflation has been more volatile than during the nice decade. In 1998, before he joined the Bank, Charlie Bean estimated that the normal variation in the economy would lead inflation to be more than 1 percentage point away from target for around 40% of the time. And in the past three years, inflation has been more than 1 percentage point away from target in 17 months, or 47% of the time. Yet that was a period   BIS Review 136/2010                                                                             3 of extraordinary volatility in the economy and at the same time we managed to absorb a 25% fall in sterling�s effective exchange rate, something that historically would have created far more serious inflationary problems. The key question is whether the current inflation rate signals that inflation will persist above target. The MPC is conscious that the continuing high level of inflation poses the risk that inflation expectations may move up. And it may be some while before inflation returns to target. But at present, there is also a risk � at least as large � that once the temporary upward influences on inflation dissipate, the influence of spare capacity in the economy will push inflation below the target. Consistent with that possibility, a range of other indicators � growth in broad money, pay, and the pressure of demand on supply, that together are likely to be a more reliable guide to inflationary pressure looking ahead � all remain extremely subdued. So not only can monetary policy play a role in smoothing the rebalancing process, it needs to do so if the outlook for inflation is to remain in line with the 2% target in the medium term. Because there are risks on both sides of the outlook, reasonable people can disagree about the monetary policy judgement. In recent speeches, different MPC members have emphasised upside and downside risks to inflation. After the event, no doubt whichever risk has crystallised will be described by the critics as inevitable. Unfortunately, we do not have a crystal ball. So in setting policy today the only coherent approach is to balance those two risks. The next decade will not be nice. History suggests that after a financial crisis the hangover lasts for a while. So the next decade is likely to be a sober decade � a decade of savings, orderly budgets, and equitable rebalancing. Our prospects remain closely linked to developments in the rest of the world. But we can influence the outcome, with monetary policy still a potent weapon to ensure that the amount of money in the economy is growing neither too slowly, as in the recent past, nor too quickly so as to reignite inflation. With that, and the inspiration provided by the Black Country�s example of how to adapt to economic change, I am sure of one thing. A sober decade may not be fun but it is necessary for our economic health.     4                                                                                  BIS Review 136/2010
2010-10-28	"Mervyn King: Banking � from Bagehot to Basel, and back again Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Second Bagehot Lecture, Buttonwood Gathering, New York, 25 October 2010.                                                 *    *    *  I am indebted to Stephen Burgess, Philip Evans, Andy Haldane, Andrew Hauser, Vicky Saporta, Jenny Scott, Paul Tucker and especially to Iain de Weymarn for their useful comments and suggestions on earlier drafts.    1.         Introduction Walter Bagehot was a brilliant observer and writer on contemporary economic and financial matters. In his remarkable book Lombard Street, Bagehot brought together his own observations with the analysis of earlier thinkers such as Henry Thornton to provide a critique of central banking as practised by the Bank of England and a manifesto for how central banks could handle financial crises in future by acting as a lender of last resort. The present financial crisis dwarfs any of those witnessed by Bagehot. What lessons can we draw from recent and current experience to update Bagehot�s vision of finance and central banking? Surely the most important lesson from the financial crisis is the importance of a resilient and robust banking system. The countries most affected by the banking crisis have experienced the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Output is somewhere between 5% and 10% below where it would have been had there not been a crisis. Unemployment is up, businesses have closed, and the direct and indirect costs to the taxpayer have resulted in fiscal deficits in several countries of over 10% of GDP � the largest peacetime deficits ever. At the heart of this crisis was the expansion and subsequent contraction of the balance sheet of the banking system. Other parts of the financial system in general functioned normally. And we saw in 1987 and again in the early 2000s, that a sharp fall in equity values did not cause the same damage as did the banking crisis. Equity markets provide a natural safety valve, and when they suffer sharp falls, economic policy can respond. But when the banking system failed in September 2008, not even massive injections of both liquidity and capital by the state could prevent a devastating collapse of confidence and output around the world. So it is imperative that we find an answer to the question of how to make our banking system more stable. As Bagehot knew only too well, banking crises are endemic to the market economy that has evolved since the Industrial Revolution. The words �banking� and �crises� are natural bedfellows. If love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage, then banking and crisis go together like Oxford and the Isis, intertwined for as long as anyone can remember. Unfortunately, such crises are occurring more frequently and on an ever larger scale. Why?   2.         The practice of banking: For almost a century after Bagehot wrote Lombard Street, the size of the banking sector in the UK, relative to GDP, was broadly stable at around 50%. But, over the past fifty years, bank balance sheets have grown so fast that today they are over five times annual GDP. The size of the US banking industry has grown from around 20% in Bagehot�s time to around 100% of GDP today. And, until recently, the true scale of balance sheets was understated by these figures because banks were allowed to put exposures to entities such as special purpose vehicles off balance sheet. Surprisingly, such an extraordinary rate of expansion has been accompanied by increasing concentration: the largest institutions have expanded the most. Table 1 shows that the asset holdings of the top ten banks in the UK amount to over 450% of GDP, with RBS, Barclays    BIS Review 140/2010                                                                                     1 and HSBC each individually having assets in excess of UK GDP. Table 2 shows that in the US, the top ten banks amount to over 60% of GDP, six times larger than the top ten fifty years ago. Bank of America today accounts for the same proportion of the US banking system as all of the top 10 banks put together in 1960. While banks� balance sheets have exploded, so have the risks associated with those balance sheets. Bagehot would have been used to banks with leverage ratios (total assets, or liabilities, to capital) of around six to one. But capital ratios have declined and leverage has risen. Immediately prior to the crisis, leverage in the banking system of the industrialised world had increased to astronomical levels. Simple leverage ratios of close to 50 or more could be found in the US, UK, and the continent of Europe, driven in part by the expansion of trading books (Brennan, Haldane and Madouros, 2010). And banks resorted to using more short-term, wholesale funding. The average maturity of wholesale funding issued by banks has declined by two thirds in the UK and by around three quarters in the US over the past thirty years � at the same time as reliance on wholesale funding has increased. As a result, they have run a higher degree of maturity mismatch between their long-dated assets and short-term funding. To cap it all, they held a lower proportion of liquid assets on their balance sheets, so they were more exposed if some of the short-term funding dried up. In less than fifty years, the share of highly liquid assets that UK banks hold has declined from around a third of their assets to less than 2% last year (Bank of England, 2009). Banks tested the limits of where the risk-return trade-off was located, in all parts of their operations. As John Kay wrote about his experience on the board of HBoS, the problems began �on the day it was decided that treasury should be a profit centre in its own right rather than an ancillary activity� (Kay, 2008). Moreover, the size of the balance sheet is no longer limited by the scale of opportunities to lend to companies or individuals in the real economy. So-called �financial engineering� allows banks to manufacture additional assets without limit. And in the run-up to the crisis, they were aided and abetted in this endeavour by a host of vehicles and funds in the so-called shadow banking system, which in the US grew in gross terms to be larger than the traditional banking sector. This shadow banking system, as well as holding securitised debt and a host of manufactured � or �synthetic� � exposures was also a significant source of funding for the conventional banking system. Money market funds and other similar entities had call liabilities totalling over $7 trillion. And they on lent very significant amounts to banks, both directly and indirectly via chains of transactions. This has had two consequences. First, the financial system has become enormously more interconnected. This means that promoting stability of the system as a whole using a regime of regulation of individual institutions is much less likely to be successful than hitherto. Maturity mismatch can grow through chains of transactions � without any significant amount being located in any one institution � a risk described many years ago by Martin Hellwig (Hellwig, 1995). Second, although many of these positions net out when the financial system is seen as a whole, gross balance sheets are not restricted by the scale of the real economy and so banks were able to expand at a remarkable pace. So when the crisis began in 2007, uncertainty about where losses would ultimately fall led confidence in banks to seep away. This was obvious through the crisis. Almost no institution was immune from suspicion, the result of the knock-on consequences so eloquently described by Bagehot when he wrote: �At first, incipient panic amounts to a kind of vague conversation: Is A. B. as good as he used to be? Has not C. D. lost money? and a thousand such questions. A hundred people are talked about, and a thousand think, �Am I talked about, or am I not?� �Is my credit as good as it used to be, or is it less?� And every day, as a panic grows, this floating suspicion becomes both more intense and more diffused; it attacks more persons; and attacks them all more virulently than at first. All men of experience, therefore, try to �strengthen themselves,� as it is called, in the early stage of a panic; they borrow money while they can; they come to their banker and offer bills for discount, which commonly they would not have offered for days or    2                                                                                    BIS Review 140/2010 weeks to come. And if the merchant be a regular customer, a banker does not like to refuse, because if he does he will be said, or may be said, to be in want of money, and so may attract the panic to himself.� This sentiment is described more prosaically in Tables 3 and 4. They show that the risk premia demanded by investors to lend to all large banks rose very sharply during the crisis. For most banks the spreads on their senior unsecured debt had more than trebled in October 2008 relative to their levels at the start of 2007. Similarly, credit default swap premia � the cost of insuring a bank�s debt � shot up. All banks, irrespective of the precise nature of their business and balance sheet, were tarred with the same brush. Moreover spreads and CDS premia remain elevated today � almost universally, large UK and US banks face much higher borrowing charges compared to risk-free rates, and are seen as riskier entities, than prior to the crisis. The size, concentration and riskiness of banks have increased in an extraordinary fashion and would be unrecognisable to Bagehot. Higher reported rates of return on equity were superficial hallmarks of success. These higher rates of return were required by, and a consequence of, the change in the pattern of banks� funding with increased leverage and more short-term funding. They did not represent a significant improvement in the overall rate of return on assets. Not merely were banks� own reported profits exaggerating the contribution of the financial sector to the economy, so were the national accounts. In the US, the share of gross value added of the financial sector as a share of GDP rose from around 2�3% in the decade after World War II to about 8% in 2008, driven in large part by a rise in the gross operating surplus of financial intermediaries. And in the UK, in the past decade, the measured scale of the financial sector, compared to GDP, has roughly doubled to around 10%. But this exaggerates the contribution of financial services. Banks do not always charge directly for the services they provide. So the value added of the financial sector is measured by official statisticians (using the United Nations System of National Accounts) as the difference between interest receipts and payments of a �reference rate of interest� which attempts to measure the pure cost of borrowing funds. This convention overstates the true value added of the financial sector because it includes the return to risky lending represented by the difference between the hypothetical pure cost of borrowing funds and the return that is earned. But the fact that risk is channelled through an intermediation industry does not mean that the value added from risk-bearing in the economy is solely attributable to the existence of an intermediation sector. If companies financed themselves directly from households, the statisticians would regard the return on risk-bearing as value added created in that industry. Financial intermediation does add value, but not as much as the statistical convention would suggest. Moreover, a financial sector that takes on risk with the implicit support of the tax-payer can generate measured value added that reflects not genuine risk-bearing but the upside profits from the implicit subsidy. And even without an implicit subsidy the return to risk-bearing can be mismeasured. It is widely understood that an insurance company should not count as profits the receipt of premia on an insurance policy that will pay out only when a low- frequency event occurs at some point in the future. But part of the value added of the financial sector prior to the crisis reflected temporary profits from taking risk and it was only after September 2008 that much of that so-called economic activity resulted in enormous reported losses by banks. It is possible to make a very rough estimate of the possible size of this distortion in the reported financial sector output data. If we assume that true labour and capital productivity in the financial services industry grew in line with that in the wider economy in the 10 years prior to the crisis, then, given the inputs of capital and labour over that period, the official estimate might have overstated UK financial sector value added by almost �30 billion up to 2007 � around half of the growth in the official measure. The impact of this adjustment on overall GDP is likely to be relatively small because much of the output of the financial sector    BIS Review 140/2010                                                                             3 is treated as intermediate inputs to other sectors in the economy. Such an estimate is supported by the finding of my Bank of England colleagues that the increase in rates of return on equity earned by banks were accounted for almost entirely by an increase in leverage, capital gains on assets in trading books and the reported profits on contracts that produced losses only after the crisis occurred. And it is consistent with the estimates calculated by Colangelo and Inklaar (2010) for the euro area. They found that around 40% of measured financial sector value added probably captured compensation for bearing risk.   3.       The theory of banking Why are banks so risky? The starting point is that banks make heavy use of short-term debt. Short-term debt holders can always run if they start to have doubts about an institution. Equity holders and long-term debt holders cannot cut and run so easily. Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig showed nearly thirty years ago that this can create fragile institutions even in the absence of risk associated with the assets that a bank holds. All that is required is a cost to the liquidation of long-term assets and that banks serve customers on a first-come, first-served basis (Diamond and Dybvig, 1983). Nevertheless, there are benefits to this maturity transformation � funds can be pooled allowing a greater proportion to be directed to long-term illiquid investments, and less held back to meet individual needs for liquidity. And from Diamond�s and Dybvig�s insights, flows an intellectual foundation for many of the policy structures that we have today � especially deposit insurance and Bagehot�s time-honoured key principle of central banks acting as lender of last resort in a crisis. If the only problem is one of illiquidity leading to fragility, then central banks can easily act to ward off problems. By demonstrating a willingness to step in to provide temporary liquidity support, then the likelihood of problems arising in the first place is dramatically diminished. It was wholly appropriate that this was the focus of Bagehot�s writings � at the time, the structure of the banking system meant that illiquidity was often the key problem. And central banks did not appreciate the importance of the role that they could play. Bagehot�s whole purpose was to convince the Bank of England to fulfil this role. But the changes in the banking system over the past fifty years mean that a much more diverse range of problems can strike today. In September 2007, everyone thought that the crisis was one of liquidity and as a result there was an expectation central banks could provide the solution. But it quickly became clear that it was in fact a crisis of solvency. Diamond and Dybvig�s analysis consciously omitted the fact that, in reality, banks� assets are risky. And not only are banks� assets risky, but banks are highly leveraged institutions. This leaves them heavily exposed � with very high debt-equity ratios, small movements in asset valuations are enough to wipe out their equity and leave banks insolvent. That means the distinction between illiquidity and solvency can be difficult in practice � the difference in timing might be just a few days. If a crisis is in fact one of insolvency, brought on by excessive leverage and risk, then central bank liquidity provision cannot provide the answer. Central banks can offer liquidity insurance only to solvent institutions or as a bridge to a more permanent solution. It is this structure, in which risky long-term assets are funded by short-term deposits, that makes banks so hazardous. Yet many treat loans to banks as if they were riskless. In isolation, this would be akin to a belief in alchemy � risk-free deposits can never be supported by long-term risky investments in isolation. To work, financial alchemy requires the implicit support of the tax payer. When all the functions of the financial system are heavily interconnected, any problems that arise can end up playing havoc with services vital to the functioning of the economy � the payments system, the services of money and the provision of working capital to industry. If such services are materially threatened, governments will never be able to sit idly by. Institutions supplying such services are quite simply too important to fail. Everyone knows it. So, highly risky banking institutions enjoy implicit public sector support. In turn, public support   4                                                                                     BIS Review 140/2010 incentivises banks to take on yet more risk, knowing that, if things go well, they will reap the rewards while the public sector will foot the bill if things go wrong. Greater risk begets greater size, most probably greater importance to the functioning of the economy, higher implicit public subsidies, and hence yet larger incentives to take risk � described by Martin Wolf as the �financial doomsday machine�. The failure in the crisis was not one of intellectual imagination or economic science to understand these issues. Economists recognised that distorted incentives, whether arising from implicit public subsidies, asymmetric information or a host of other imperfections, will cause a market-based outcome to be sub-optimal from the perspective of society. This idea has been at the centre of modern economics since the extraordinary series of papers written by Arrow and Debreu in the 1950s (Arrow, 1951; Debreu, 1951; Arrow and Debreu, 1954). The real failure was a lapse into hubris � we came to believe that crises created by massive maturity transformation were problems that no longer applied to modern banking, that they belonged to an era in which people wore whiskers and top hats. There was an inability to see through the veil of modern finance to the fact that the balance sheets of too many banks were an accident waiting to happen, with levels of leverage on a scale that could not resist even the slightest tremor to confidence about the uncertain value of bank assets. For all the clever innovation in the financial system, its Achilles heel was, and remains, simply the extraordinary � indeed absurd � levels of leverage represented by a heavy reliance on short- term debt. Modern financiers are now invoking other dubious claims to resist reforms that might limit the public subsidies they have enjoyed in the past. No one should blame them for that � indeed, we should not expect anything else. They are responding to incentives. Some claim that reducing leverage and holding more equity capital would be expensive. But, as economists, such as my colleague David Miles (2010) and Anat Admati and her colleagues (Admati et. al., 2010), have argued, the cost of capital overall is much less sensitive to changes in the amount of debt in a bank�s balance sheet than many bankers claim � a proposition demonstrated forcefully by Professors Modigliani and Miller over fifty years ago (Modigliani and Miller, 1958). And the benefits to society, most obviously through greater financial stability, but also through factors such as higher tax revenue, are likely to swamp any change in the private costs faced by banks. What does reduce the cost of capital is the ability to borrow short to lend long. But the scale of maturity transformation undertaken today produces private benefits and social costs. We have seen from the experience of first Iceland, and now Ireland, the results that can follow from allowing a banking system to become too large relative to national output without having first solved the �too important to fail� problem.   4.         Finding a solution Many remedies for reducing the riskiness of our financial system have been proposed, ranging from higher capital requirements on banks to functional separation and other more radical ideas. The guiding principle of any change should be to ensure that the costs of maturity transformation � the costs of periodic financial crises � fall on those who enjoy the benefits of maturity transformation � the reduced cost of financial intermediation. All proposals should be evaluated by this simple criterion. The first, and most obvious, response to the divergence between private benefits and social costs is the imposition of a permanent tax on the activity of maturity transformation to �internalise the externalities�. Such a tax, or levy, has been discussed by the G7, and introduced in the UK. The principle that the �polluter pays� for the costs they impose on others is an old one, going back at least to Pigou in the 1920s. The main practical problem is to calibrate the costs to maturity transformation. The loss of world output from the financial crisis is enormous, even though such a crisis might be considered a once in a generation, or even once in a century, event. It is not difficult to see that a crisis that reduces output by   BIS Review 140/2010                                                                             5 between 5% and 10% for a number of years, and occurs once every fifty years, amounts to an annual cost several multiples of the revenue that will be generated by the UK bank levy (Haldane, 2010). But how can we be certain of correctly establishing what the tax should be when we are trying to internalise costs that occur so infrequently? So although there is a sound case for a levy directed at the size of short-term borrowing, it would be foolish to regard that as the main tool to align costs and benefits of risky balance sheet activity. If setting the appropriate price is hard, then some form of controls on quantities might be a better answer (Weitzman, 1974). For example, limits on leverage have much to commend them. And for a generation, the quantitative control of this type that regulators have embraced was embodied in the capital standards set within the Basel framework. Last month a new concordat on such standards was reached in Basel � the so-called Basel III requirements. The challenge here is to set the requirements in a way that will materially affect the probability of a crisis. Other forms of quantitative intervention include functional separation to reduce the costs of maturity transformation by ring-fencing those activities that we are most concerned to safeguard from disruption. If successful, the costs of any failure of financial institutions would be reduced. The challenge with this approach is to prevent the costs associated with the activity of maturity transformation from gravitating to another set of institutions � the �shadow� banking system. Whatever solution is adopted, the aim must be to align private and social costs.   5.       Why Basel III is not a complete answer Lauded as a new standard, Basel III is seen by some as the answer to the failure of regulation to prevent the financial crisis. It is certainly a step in the right direction, an improvement on both Basel I and the ill-fated Basel II, and we should all welcome it. But if it is a giant leap for the regulators of the world, it is only a small step for mankind. Basel III on its own will not prevent another crisis for a number of reasons. First, even the new levels of capital are insufficient to prevent another crisis. Calibrating required capital by reference to the losses incurred during the recent crisis takes inadequate account of the benefits to banks of massive government intervention and the implicit guarantee. More fundamentally, it fails to recognise that when sentiment changes only very high levels of capital would be sufficient to enable banks to obtain funding on anything like normal spreads to policy rates, as we can see at present. When investors change their view about the unknowable future � as they will occasionally in sudden and discontinuous ways � banks that were perceived as well-capitalised can seem under-capitalised with concerns over their solvency. That is what happened in 2007�08. As the IMF have pointed out differences in capital ratios failed to predict which financial institutions would be vulnerable in the crisis (IMF, 2009). Only very much higher levels of capital � levels that would be seen by the industry as wildly excessive most of the time � would prevent such a crisis. Second, the Basel approach calculates the amount of capital required by using a measure of �risk-weighted� assets. Those risk weights are computed from past experience. Yet the circumstances in which capital needs to be available to absorb potential losses are precisely those when earlier judgements about the risk of different assets and their correlation are shown to be wrong. One might well say that a financial crisis occurs when the Basel risk weights turn out to be poor estimates of underlying risk. And that is not because investors, banks or regulators are incompetent. It is because the relevant risks are often impossible to assess in terms of fixed probabilities. Events can take place that we could not have envisaged, let alone to which we could attach probabilities. If only banks were playing in a casino then we probably could calculate appropriate risk weights. Unfortunately, the world is more complicated. So the regulatory framework needs to contain elements that are robust     6                                                                                  BIS Review 140/2010 with respect to changes in the appropriate risk weights, and that is why the Bank of England advocated a simple leverage ratio as a key backstop to capital requirements. Third, the Basel framework still focuses largely on the assets side of a bank�s balance sheet. Basel II excluded consideration of the liquidity and liability structure of the balance sheet, so much so that when the UK adopted Basel II in 2007, of all the major banks the one with the highest capital ratio was, believe it or not, Northern Rock. Within weeks of announcing that it intended to return excess capital to its shareholders, Northern Rock ran out of money. Basel II was based on a judgement that mortgages were the safest form of lending irrespective of how they were financed. If a business model is based around a particular funding model that suddenly becomes unviable, then the business model becomes unviable too, as events in 2007 showed. Whether the measures included in Basel III will be able to deal properly with the risks that result from inadequate levels of liquid assets and a risky structure of liabilities remains to be seen. One criticism of Basel III with which I have no truck is the length of the transition period. Banks have up to 2019 to adjust fully to the new requirements. Although some of the calculations of the alleged economic cost of higher capital requirements presented by the industry seem to me exaggerated (Institute of International Finance, 2010), I do believe that it is important in the present phase of de-leveraging not to exacerbate the challenge banks face in raising capital today. Banks should take advantage of opportunities to raise loss- absorbing capital, and should recognise the importance of using profits to rebuild capital rather than pay out higher dividends and compensation. But we must not forget the principle underlying the Basel approach: asking banks to maintain a buffer of capital above the minimum requirement allows them to run the buffer down in circumstances like the present. Rebuilding the buffer is a task for the future. So even though the Bank of England would have preferred an agreement to set capital ratios at higher levels in the long run, we have no intention of asking UK banks to adopt a faster timetable for implementation of Basel III. That logic should apply to any reforms we choose to implement. We should not expect to change the financial system for the better overnight. Rather we need radical reforms that will give us a much more robust system in the long run, accepting that it may take a period of many years to get there. As with a bank levy, it is no criticism of Basel III to say that it is not a �silver bullet�. The difficulty of identifying and calibrating the difference between the private and social costs of maturity transformation means that there is merit in having a basket of different measures to rein in excessive risk-taking. In the area of financial stability, it makes sense to have both belt and braces.   6.         Large institutions The implicit subsidy to banks that are perceived as �too important to fail� can be important to banks of any size but is usually seen as bigger for large institutions for which existing bank resolution procedures either do or could not apply. Moreover, most large complex financial institutions are global � at least in life if not in death. So a major international effort is underway to try to work out how best to deal with such institutions, initiated by heads of government at the G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh in 2009. Much of this work is being led by the Financial Stability Board. Ideas agreed in principle or under consideration include an addition to the Basel III capital requirement of an extra layer of either equity or other loss-absorbing capital, a special resolution regime for large institutions that would allow losses to be shared among creditors as well as equity-holders, and tentative steps towards international harmonisation of resolution procedures on which my colleague Paul Tucker and others are engaged. Some countries have already started down the road of augmenting the Basel calibration with additional requirements of their own for large banks. Earlier this month the Swiss authorities announced just such a requirement for their two current systemically important banks � UBS   BIS Review 140/2010                                                                              7 and Credit Suisse. In future, they will have to hold additional amounts of both equity capital and loss-bearing contingent capital which takes their total holding of equity-like capital to 19%, compared with the Basel standard of 7%. But in most other countries, identifying in advance a group of financial institutions whose failure would be intolerable, and so are �too important to fail�, is a hazardous undertaking. In itself it would simply increase the subsidy by making it explicit. And it is hard to see why institutions whose failure cannot be contemplated should be in the private sector in the first place. But if international regulators failed to agree on higher capital requirements in general, adding to the loss-absorbing capacity of large institutions could be a second-best outcome. Solving the �too important to fail� problem will require ultimately that every financial sector entity can be left to fail without risk of threatening the functioning of the economy. So it is natural that improved resolution procedures is part of the overall strategy � and within many countries big steps forward have already been taken. But the successful resolution of a large institution would, in the absence of an implausibly large deposit insurance fund, require the ability to bail-in creditors. Yet that possibility would give an incentive to the bank to increase its dependence on short-term funding so that more creditors might get out in time. That might increase rather than decrease the fragility of the institution. So there would need to be restrictions on the maturity structure of its liabilities. Resolution would naturally go hand-in- hand with a greater reliance on instruments such as contingent capital. And there would be enormous challenges in resolving global banks that span countries with different legal jur"

Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the 2011 Economic Summit, Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR), Stanford, California, 11 March 2011.                                                  *    *     *  I am indebted to Charlie Bean, Martin Brooke, Oliver Bush, Ed Dew, Katie Farrant, Andrew Hauser, Jenny Scott, Misa Tanaka and Iain de Weymarn who have worked closely with me in preparing this speech, and to Michelle Wright and Rumman Khan for their excellent assistance in preparing the empirical and historical research.  No country, however large or small, is an economic island. Trade has always been the key to faster economic growth and higher living standards. Some of the most successful examples of economic development have followed the path of export-led growth, and some of the most unsuccessful have not. South Korea, for example, exports the same amount of manufactures in a day as Egypt exports in a month, and its GDP per head is now five times higher. And trade is not restricted to goods. The days when trade was measured by weight or volume of cargo through our ports have, by and large, gone. Services account for around a fifth of world trade, a proportion that is growing. The expansion of trade in services is related to the rise of technologies that make it easier to transmit services around the world. Within a few miles of this conference room are companies like Apple, Facebook and Google that have transformed the way in which services can be provided worldwide. And even the older services have become tradable � over the course of a century the All England Lawn Tennis Club Championships at Wimbledon have grown from a small local tournament to the world�s premier tennis event driven by a global television audience of around 400 million people in 187 countries (as many as are members of the IMF). But international trade requires a monetary system to flourish � the rise of the successful Asian economies would never have occurred if they had been restricted to barter. If flexible exchange rates were allowed to determine the relative values of different currencies in competitive markets, why should there be any need for �rules of the game� or an international currency? Indeed, is the phrase �international monetary system� an oxymoron? That leads to the question I want to discuss today: what is meant by the international monetary system and do we need one? Over the years, views on the need for �rules of the game� governing international payments have ebbed and flowed. So it is not surprising that France has chosen the international monetary system as a theme of its presidency of the G20 this year. Why not leave these issues to market forces? What are the externalities in the international monetary system which mean that one country�s actions distort the choices open to others? The main externalities in today�s international monetary system are most visible in the interaction between the advanced and emerging economies. The rising importance of the emerging economies has perhaps been the most important development since the Bretton Woods framework of fixed exchange rates was abandoned in the early 1970s. China and India alone have brought 2 � billion people into the world trading system, with many more in other countries such as Brazil and Russia. And over the next five years, emerging economies are expected to account for almost three quarters of total growth in world output. Trade has promoted development in China and other emerging markets, and has benefited the rest of the world as the costs of a range of traded goods and services, particularly manufactured goods, have been driven down. But the emergence of the accompanying imbalances in current accounts had huge effects on the global pattern of spending. Between 1998 and 2006, annual output in high-saving economies expanded by around $10 trillion � $1trillion more than the growth in domestic demand in the same economies. The rise in   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                              1 output relative to demand in the high-saving countries was only possible because there were matching capital flows. Capital flowed �uphill� from many of the emerging markets to advanced deficit economies, not an obvious sign of capital moving to exploit profitable investment opportunities. The deficit countries � predominately the US, UK, Australia and countries in the euro-area periphery � were borrowing almost $1trillion dollars more each year by 2006 than they had been in 1998. This created unsustainable paths for domestic demand, net debt and long-term real interest rates. Whether households or policymakers truly understood how unsustainable these paths were is hard to know. But the extent of the resulting financial fragility became all too apparent in late 2008. Credit supply in many of the advanced economies froze, confidence collapsed around the world and private demand fell sharply. Output was cushioned only through an unprecedented policy response around the world. That did bring an end to the sharp falls in output, and allowed confidence to recover somewhat. And in many countries, particularly those that did not suffer directly from banking crises, output has bounced back. Yet this extraordinary policy response has simply postponed much of the required adjustment in spending patterns around the world. And long-term real interest rates are unsustainably low. The challenges of sustainability are most evident in vulnerable euro-area periphery countries. Unable to sustain domestic spending through further borrowing they are now struggling to substitute external demand for domestic spending. They face a major challenge to raise output by enough to allow them to service existing debt and to bring unemployment down. This is particularly difficult within a currency union because, without a flexible exchange rate, it is not easy for them to lower domestic prices relative to those overseas. And even if that were possible, the burden of debt, denominated in nominal terms, would rise relative to income. These countries, then, are heavily dependent on the pattern of spending elsewhere and would benefit greatly from an expansion in domestic demand in countries with stronger balance sheets. The main lesson from the experience of the imbalances is that national policy frameworks alone were unable to prevent domestic demand from growing at an unsustainable rate. Inter- temporal budget constraints do not exercise the same discipline as constraints that are immediately binding. So unsustainable paths of spending and precarious stock positions developed. As a result, abrupt, and costly, adjustment at some point in the future was always likely. Markets can enforce inter-temporal budget constraints only over a long-time horizon. As a result, countries can pursue inconsistent policies for long periods, and a range of imperfections in the financial system encourages them to do so. An example of those imperfections is that opportunities to insure against exchange rate fluctuations are limited � markets are incomplete. Exchange rates can move in surprising and unpredictable ways. Over the past twenty years, the ratio of the highest to the lowest dollar-yen exchange rate was almost 2 to 1, and the same was true of the dollar-euro rate. The difficulty in insuring against such swings means that this volatility can induce large fluctuations in output with unnecessary costs incurred in the relocation of resources and employment. Fixed, or managed, exchange rate regimes may help to limit the real economic costs of �excessive� volatility that reflects short-lived shifts in market sentiment, but if they impede desirable adjustments of real exchange rates, they contribute to unsustainable patterns of spending. There are other reasons why emerging economies, in particular, have managed their exchange rates. Perhaps the most important is that pushing down on the exchange rate is a means to pursue a strategy of export-led growth. Another motive, important in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, was to build up large precautionary balances of foreign exchange reserves as a way of insuring against sudden reversals in capital flows, especially of short- term bank lending, that proved so damaging in the 1990s.     2                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches Such policies distorted saving and exchange rates, and created large capital flows unrelated to the distribution of profitable real investment opportunities. Given imperfections in financial markets in both borrowing and lending countries, such capital flows can lead to a degree of fragility, such that, when adjustment comes, there is a high probability that it will be abrupt. For example, the distortion from a �too important to fail� implicit subsidy to the funding costs of banks in the industrialised world led to excessive leverage in these countries. Creditors were prepared to lend at lower rates and on a greater scale than they would have without the implicit subsidy. In other countries, financial repression artificially raised saving rates by making borrowing too costly. This highlights the need to focus reform efforts on the international monetary and financial system (IMFS). There are, therefore, both �good� and �bad� imbalances. On the one hand, the advantage of globalisation is that it allows savings to flow to where the rate of return on new investment is highest. On the other hand, imbalances can be a symptom of distortions to the price signals in the economy, leading to unsustainable patterns of capital flows and spending that are costly to correct. Distinguishing between them will never be easy, but is necessary when setting monetary, fiscal and financial policy. But we should assess imbalances in terms of whether their consequences are �good� or �bad� � that is, whether they are creating a distorting externality. So how should we reform the current system of monetary arrangements? If problems abound, there is certainly no shortage of proposed solutions. Since Bretton Woods, there have been regular suggestions for changing from fixed to flexible exchange rates, or the other way round, returning to the gold standard, creating a new international currency, changing the composition of the currency basket comprising Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), abolishing or introducing controls on capital flows, and providing new ways of holding currency reserves. What is much less clear, however, is the problem to which these proposed solutions are thought to be the answer. I have suggested that we need to analyse more carefully the imperfections, or frictional costs, which make a regime of floating exchange rates an insufficient answer in itself. The crucial frictional costs, it seems to me, are those associated with a sharp fall in output and employment following an abrupt adjustment in the current account, whether brought about by a sudden movement in exchange rates or the collapse of a financial system. They reflect distortions of the price signals for inter-temporal saving and financing decisions. Both the Asian and the recent financial crisis were vivid illustrations of how large those costs can be. Central to any solution is a problem that has not been resolved since the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, namely the asymmetric pressures on, and responsibilities of, deficit and surplus countries to adjust their spending patterns. In trying to deal with this central question, we should not get sidetracked by issues such as changing the composition of the SDR basket. The SDR is a reserve asset, not a reserve currency, and as such has rather little to do with the emergence of unsustainable levels of spending and interest rates. Our predecessors were well aware of the central issue. At Bretton Woods, both American and British officials presented proposals for schemes to impose more symmetric obligations on both surplus and deficit countries. For the United States, Harry Dexter White, an alumnus of Stanford, put forward the idea of a �scarce currency� clause for the Articles of the IMF. And his British counterpart, John Maynard Keynes, proposed an International Clearing Union with penalties on large surpluses or deficits (his suggestion of a new currency, the bancor, was included primarily because at the time national currencies were not convertible). His aim was to ensure symmetric obligations. As he wrote in 1941,         �[T]he social strain of an adjustment downwards is much greater than that of an         adjustment upwards. And besides this, the process of adjustment is compulsory         for the debtor and voluntary for the creditor. If the creditor does not choose to         make, or allow, his share of the adjustment, he suffers no inconvenience. For   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                   3       whilst a country�s reserve cannot fall below zero, there is no ceiling which sets an       upper limit. The same is true if international loans are to be the means of       adjustment. The debtor must borrow; the creditor is under no such compulsion�. And ever since then, the absence of an effective symmetric framework of obligations on both debtor and creditor countries has led to periodic crises. The obstacle to the creation of a binding framework is clear. Governments know whether they are debtors or creditors today. So a framework that has economic and indeed moral force when seen from behind the �veil of ignorance�, as suggested by John Rawls, is unlikely to appeal to governments. Should we conclude, therefore, that in the absence of a world government, the identification of �new rules of the game� is likely to be no more than a theoretical exercise? Certainly, the fate of Keynes� proposal for an International Clearing Union is not encouraging. But the experience of the past twenty years shows that large imbalances mean that everyone suffers when there is a sharp adjustment. So there is scope, if not for formal international policy coordination, then for an international conversation about how to improve a system that is fragile. Central banks were able to ensure, for a while, that the paths of output were sustainable � consistent with low and stable inflation. But the patterns of demand were far from sustainable. And when the sharp adjustment to demand eventually came, it inevitably had implications for the level of output. Reform of the IMFS, and of our domestic financial systems, is a necessary complement to the domestic price stability oriented policy frameworks of central banks. The immediate issue of how to move to a more sustainable position requires a resolution of different countries� economic strategies for rebalancing. There can be only one path for rebalancing � with rebalancing in the deficit economies, by definition, just a mirror of that in the surplus countries. But the path that would be chosen by high-saving economies differs from that which the more indebted industrialised economies would prefer. Their need to deleverage and reduce borrowing means that if another abrupt adjustment is to be avoided, they cannot risk taking too long to rebalance their economies. In contrast, many of the emerging economies continue to require rapid economic growth and abundant employment opportunities in their export industries to ensure adequate levels of employment for their vast populations. As a result, policymakers in countries like China quite simply see limits to the extent and speed at which they should expand the share of domestic demand in their economies. They do not want to rebalance their economies too quickly. Of course, ex post there must be consistency between these two strategies as demand in the world as a whole must �add up�. The current pattern of demand in the world economy is unsustainable. The political tension generated by the divergent preferences of surplus and deficit countries risks moves towards protectionism, as happened in the 1930s. So there must be scope, in the short term, for a �grand bargain� to adopt a set of policies that would support an agreed path of rebalancing and avert a move towards protectionism. Such a �grand bargain� should be the central objective of the G20�s Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth. It would require a shared analysis, seemingly absent at present, of the relative importance of the �good� and �bad� aspects of the imbalances. And it should comprise (i) an agreed path for the reduction or increase of net exports relative to domestic demand; (ii) an agreed framework for allowing real exchange rates to support the path for unwinding the imbalances; (iii) a set of rules governing the circumstances in which countries would be able to limit short-term capital flows; (iv) macro-prudential policies to limit the build-up of imbalances and add to the instruments available to pursue financial stability; and (v) structural policies, including fiscal measures, to raise national savings in deficit countries and to lower savings in surplus countries. Some combination of all of these elements will be necessary in order to chart a path back to sustainability. There are pitfalls to avoid. Too often the policy response to a sharp adjustment to an unsustainable position starts and ends with the provision of liquidity. Rarely, however, is the   4                                                                            BIS central bankers� speeches problem a temporary shortage of liquidity. As we have seen since 2007, and on many occasions before that, most players � whether financial institutions or countries � would like others to believe that greater provision of liquidity is the answer. Almost always the provision of liquidity works only when it is the bridge to a more fundamental solution. Once rebalancing has been achieved, there will be the longer-term question of how we prevent a recurrence. There is no world government to impose �rules of the game� to internalise the externalities. So the solution can be found only in cooperation between nations. At present, the plethora of international meetings offers many chances to see the world, if not actually to save it. Ultimately, only the Bretton Woods institutions themselves � the IMF and the World Bank � have the legitimacy to represent all of their 187 member countries. But their governance is outdated. At the height of the crisis, the G20 and the G7 provided strong leadership. But legitimacy and leadership should go together. One without the other does not offer a sustainable vehicle for international cooperation. So allowing the G20 to metamorphose into the governing body of the IMF makes a good deal of sense. Such an evolution would, with a little commitment and imagination, create a single effective framework for international economic cooperation. And in the long run a more powerful and legitimate international body might be able to use its clout to deal with the imperfections and frictions that I have discussed. It might even be the vehicle for a more rules-based framework for the IMFS, based on a judgement about the sustainability of the pattern of world demand. Although that seems a distant prospect today, there is a precedent for a system of internalising cross-border externalities: the WTO already plays a similar role in international trade. So far, these rules have stood the test of time. Indeed, it is now more likely that protectionism would result from high unemployment, which the rules were not designed to prevent, than the pressures from producers which have been resisted. There is much to do. None of the underlying causes of the current crisis have been removed. The problem of �too important to fail� banks is still with us. And even more intractable is the challenge of how to reconcile free trade with a stable international monetary and financial system. Today, the most obvious problem at the global level is that the imbalances are growing again. And continuing high debt levels, although in many ways a natural response to low long-term interest rates, leave indebted countries particularly vulnerable to a rapid reversal of high saving rates in surplus countries and a rise in long-term interest rates � surely inevitable in the long run � which would drive down asset prices. It is clear that these vulnerabilities affect us all. So recognising our common interest in moving to a more sustainable pattern of world demand is in our self-interest. The global community showed that it could work together when the world economy was close to the abyss in 2008. The challenge now is to prove that we can also work together when we are no longer in an immediate crisis, but still facing deep-seated problems. Will we create a more stable IMFS? The next few years will provide the answer. And they will, as our Chinese friends say, be interesting.

2011-06-17	"Mervyn King: Monetary policy developments Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Lord Mayor�s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London, Mansion House, 15 June 2011.                                           *    *    *  My Lord Mayor, Mr Chancellor, My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen: In recent years, I have set the Mansion House audience a numerical examination. After a pleasant dinner, you will not want to listen to more numbers. A more literary style is appropriate. So my question to you tonight is: which aspect of financial regulation is most deserving of the adjective �tragic�? The answer comes later. A year ago, we met in the wake of a major sovereign debt crisis in Greece with market nervousness about how far that might spread. Since then, this crisis of external indebtedness has consumed Ireland and now Portugal, as well as Greece. Current account imbalances in the euro area remain large, should concern us all, and will certainly affect us all. Inexorably, the world economy is adjusting from an unstable disequilibrium to a new equilibrium. Trade imbalances and the associated levels of borrowing proved unsustainable. In more biblical language, failure to tackle the imbalances during the seven years of plenty before 2007 threatens seven lean years thereafter for at least part of the world economy. After a deep-seated banking crisis, now transmuted into a sovereign debt crisis, the need to reduce debt as the world adjusts to a new equilibrium pattern of spending and trade will mean only a gradual recovery in many advanced economies. Storms from the world economy are likely to stir up the waters through which the UK economy must pass as it too adjusts to a new equilibrium with lower levels of debt and a rebalancing from domestic to external demand. So, my Lord Mayor, there is no shortage of challenges at home. Consumer price inflation has risen to 4�%, and further large rises in utility prices are expected. Output has probably grown by only around 1% or so over the past year. Our banking system faces a need, over time, to build higher levels of capital and find new sources of domestic funding. And regulation must be reformed to respond to the lessons from the crisis. So I want tonight to comment briefly on three themes: monetary policy; macro-prudential policy, and the work of the new Financial Policy Committee at the Bank; and the new approach to banking regulation that will follow the creation of the Prudential Regulation Authority. The challenge facing monetary policy is obvious � the combination of high consumer price inflation and weak economic growth. Both of these might seem surprising given the large amount of spare capacity in the economy. But the rise in world energy and other commodity prices, and the need to reduce both the external and budget deficits, are squeezing real living standards, pushing up on consumer price inflation and slowing domestic consumption. The big picture is that the UK economy is going through a major rebalancing of demand and output, from private and public consumption to net exports and business investment, which will take several years to complete. A necessary precondition for that rebalancing was a fall in the real exchange rate. Markets anticipated that need. The nominal effective sterling exchange rate fell by around 25% between the start of the crisis in 2007 and the beginning of 2009, since when it has been broadly stable. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to look through the first-round effects of this depreciation on the price level. We could have made a different judgement. We could have raised Bank Rate significantly so that inflation today would be closer to the target. But that would not have prevented the squeeze on living standards arising from higher oil and commodity prices and the measures necessary to reduce our twin deficits. And it would have meant a weaker recovery, or even further falls in   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                1 output, despite our having experienced the worst downturn in output and spending since the Great Depression. To force nominal wages below their already depressed level would have meant much higher unemployment, a greater erosion of living standards, a marked degree of �undesirable volatility in output� (contrary to our remit), and a risk of inflation falling well below the target in the medium term. With the freedom granted from having our own currency, the mix of tight fiscal and loose monetary policy is necessary for a rebalancing of the economy. Because of the measures taken to reduce the enormous fiscal deficit here at home, UK sovereign debt funding costs have actually fallen relative to those in Germany since the start of last year. Of course, there can always be differences of judgement about the overall stance of policy, but to change the broad policy mix would make little sense. Of course, at some point, Bank Rate will need to rise to more normal levels in order to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target. There has been, as you know, a lively debate among the members of the MPC as to when that point will come. The Committee is watching extremely carefully for any signs of a pickup in domestically generated inflation and it will take action as soon as it is appropriate to do so. So far, subdued rates of increase in average earnings, as well as remarkably � some might say disturbingly � low growth rates of broad money have provided strong signals that inflation will fall back in due course. Banks are still contracting balance sheets and reducing leverage. Spreads between Bank Rate and the interest rates charged to many borrowers remain at unprecedentedly high levels, if indeed borrowers are able to access credit at all. When conditions in the banking sector return to something closer to normal, those spreads will contract and the rate at which that takes place will have an important influence on the speed at which Bank Rate will rise. Uncertainty inevitably surrounds both the speed of the rebalancing and the impact of today�s consumer price inflation on tomorrow�s domestically generated inflation. So it is simply impossible to know now at what point monetary tightening will begin. Let me turn now to the Bank�s new Financial Policy Committee (FPC). Its creation is a response to the lesson that monetary policy cannot target stability of both prices and the financial system. Before 2007, the massive build-up of leverage in the banking system, accompanied by a rapid growth of broad money, led to an expansion of bank balance sheets and a rise in financial fragility, but not inflation. In most industrialised countries, central banks successfully set short-term interest rates to combine steady growth of output with low and stable inflation. But this did not prevent the emergence of unsustainable patterns of demand and unstable financial systems. The FPC aims to deal with that problem by expanding the range of instruments available to the authorities. The FPC has been hard at work preparing for our first policy meeting tomorrow and our first report will be published on 24 June. The other voting members of the Committee � Adair Turner, Hector Sants, Michael Cohrs, Don Kohn, Alastair Clark, and my Bank colleagues Paul Tucker, Charlie Bean, Paul Fisher, and Andrew Haldane � make a formidable group with great experience. So what will we be doing? In devising new macro-prudential policy instruments, there is inevitably a degree of learning by doing. The FPC will be both doing and learning. In the wake of such a severe crisis, it is unlikely that excessive credit growth will be the major problem over the next few years. Indeed, the present problem is the reverse � lending is weak. We shall next week make recommendations in areas where in our judgement risks to the resilience of the system are increasing. In future, when legislation has been enacted, a key part of the FPC�s role will be to issue recommendations and directions to the new regulatory bodies, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority. The PRA will be part of the Bank, led by our new Deputy Governor, Hector Sants, and his Deputy, Andrew Bailey. Its objectives and style will differ from those of the FSA. The primary objective of the PRA will be to secure the stability of the UK financial system through its supervision of individual firms. It will not be to protect individual institutions from failure. The new legislation will make clear that the aim   2                                                                               BIS central bankers� speeches of banking regulation will be to ensure that the adverse impact of a failure of a firm on the stability of the system as a whole is minimised. That is why resolution will be at the heart of the new regulatory regime � supervisors should act knowing that resolution powers can and will be deployed in the event of failure. But adequate resolution procedures are not an alternative to ensuring that banks have sufficient loss-absorbing capital; rather they are complements. All institutions, especially so-called systemically important financial institutions, must have much higher levels of loss-absorbing capital than before the crisis. That should be in the form of common equity. A crucial part of the new Basel III framework is the recognition that only common equity is ultimately a truly loss-absorbing layer of capital. I am, therefore, concerned that the European Commission will propose a weakening of the Basel standards in that area. Moreover, as the IMF made clear in its recent Article IV Report, it would be misguided for the EU Capital Requirements Directive to prevent member countries from imposing higher capital requirements to protect the interests of domestic taxpayers. Nor should European legislation try to prevent the FPC from varying macro-prudential instruments, including capital ratios and risk weights, as appropriate to national circumstances. The Basel framework was agreed globally after long and difficult negotiations, at the request of the G20. It sets minimum not maximum capital requirements, and it envisages the use of countercyclical capital buffers set by national regulators. Until we find a solution to the �too important to fail� problem, the size of our banking system will remain too large for the UK taxpayer credibly to support in future. London is a natural home for an international banking system, with its language, time zone and, most important of all, a large and successful critical mass of banking and supporting activity. But it cannot be allowed to benefit from an unsustainable dependence on the UK taxpayer. To allow that would be unfair to millions of people, not here tonight, who are now bearing the costs of the financial crisis. It is precisely because we do want to be an international banking centre with assets a multiple of annual UK GDP that we have to find a solution to the �too important to fail� problem. A resilient banking system is in the collective interest of the financial services industry. A robust solution will surely involve a combination of limits on the leverage of individual financial institutions (as envisaged in the Basel III agreement), a resolution framework for allowing individual institutions, no matter how large, to fail, and a change in the structure of banking. I await with interest the final Report from the Independent Commission on Banking. The style of regulation will also change with the PRA. Process � more reporting, more regulators, more committees � does not lead to a safer banking system. One of the reasons for putting the PRA inside a central bank is to integrate the work of the two institutions more closely. In particular, the market intelligence team at the Bank will work closely with the supervisory body. I believe that we can operate prudential supervision at lower cost than hitherto by reducing the burden of routine data collection and focussing on the major risks to the system. It is vital that we collect and process data only where the supervisors have a need to know. Targeted and focussed regulation, allowing senior supervisors to exercise their judgement, does not require ever-increasing resources. For example, we will reduce the number of people subject to the intensive regulatory interview process before appointment by limiting such interviews to the most senior people. And one of the benefits will, I hope, be to make entry into UK banking easier and so promote competition. Let me return to the question of which aspect of financial regulation is most deserving of the adjective �tragic�. Is it light touch regulation? No � it is the mistaken belief that by compromising on unduly low capital requirements and inadequate limits on leverage, regulators can compensate by a detailed oversight of every aspect of a bank�s activities. It did not take complex reporting to see that the balance sheet of the banking system nearly trebled in five years, or that leverage ratios had reached levels of 50 or more. The obsession with detail was in fact a hindrance to seeing the big picture. And here the FPC has a crucial role to play. By drawing attention to system-wide developments, it can strengthen the hand of   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  3 the supervisor in dealing with a particular institution. Requiring prudential changes will be easier for that supervisor with the public guidance and support of the FPC. The granting of new powers to the Bank of England leads naturally and properly to questions about how we should be held accountable. The same challenge arose when the Monetary Policy Committee was set up. We took that head on and we responded. As the Treasury Committee concluded in February, �The Monetary Policy Committee and the Bank of England have repeatedly demonstrated their commitment to transparency. They have seen their engagement with the Treasury Committee as a means of securing accountability�. We will show equal commitment to accountability for the FPC and the PRA, and I look forward to discussing with the Treasury Committee how that might best be achieved. The Bank must be fully accountable to Parliament and the public. I know that some of you are concerned about the powers of the Governor. But with decisions taken by committees and enhanced accountability, those powers are not what they were. In the 1880s, the Metropolitan Railway wanted to extend the line to Amersham and Chesham. That meant acquiring land from the then Governor�s estate at Chorleywood. The Governor insisted that the company build a private station next to his home to expedite his travel to the City. I regret to say that the present Governor neither has the power to command a private railway station nor would he know where to put it if he did. My Lord Mayor, you will see that there are indeed many challenges for economic policy. We have to pass through turbulent waters. But we have set the right course. There is an appropriate policy mix to rebalance the UK economy and reach a new equilibrium. With the Financial Policy Committee there is a new body responsible for monitoring and, more importantly, responding to risks to the financial system as a whole. And a new approach to prudential supervision will be implemented by the Prudential Regulation Authority. If we stick to this course, adjusting the tiller in response to changing conditions, I am confident that we shall return to both price and financial stability. Lord Mayor, all of us here tonight would like to pay tribute to your charitable work since you became Lord Mayor. Your personal involvement in the regeneration of Spitalfields, and the Lord Mayor�s Appeal in support of disaster relief and to help children and young people in need, are a demonstration of the charitable instincts of the City of London. We salute you for that leadership, and I am sure that everyone here tonight thanks both you and the Lady Mayoress for the splendid hospitality which you have extended to us all this evening. So I invite you all to rise and join me in the traditional toast of good health and prosperity to �The Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress�, Michael and Barbara Bear.     4                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches"
2011-10-19	"Mervyn King: Monetary policy developments Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, to the Institute of Directors, St George�s Hall, Liverpool, 18 October 2011.                                              *    *   *  Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Surrounded by the magnificent architecture of St George�s Hall, we are reminded of the benefits and the costs of exposure to the world economy. Built at the peak of Liverpool�s mercantile fortunes, the Hall, and the other magnificent buildings of the cultural quarter, exhibit the prosperity derived from openness to trade. Indeed, tonight is the anniversary of a grand banquet held here on 18th October 1860 to celebrate the opening of the public library and museum building that stands opposite. Its construction had been financed by the guest of honour at the banquet that evening, William Brown, whose statue stands in the Hall today. Brown had profited from transatlantic trade both as a merchant and by establishing a bank which financed trade � at the time a risky business. In those days, finance and trade supported each other, and the city prospered. But the subsequent history of St George�s Hall, which fell into neglect in the last century, illustrates Liverpool�s vulnerability to changes in the rest of the world. The British economy too has enjoyed the benefits of globalisation. Now we are seeing some of the costs, as they play out in a global financial crisis. As a country, we are trying to rebalance our economy at a time when a global slowdown, and concerns about the solvency of European banks and sovereigns, threaten recovery here in the United Kingdom. Two weeks ago, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to resume its asset purchase programme and create new money. Before I set out the reasons for that decision, I want to explain why the global nature of the crisis means that monetary and fiscal policy in the United Kingdom can only do so much. Our fate rests to a considerable extent on the policies pursued by our trading partners. That is why the Chancellor and I put such weight on this interdependence among the major economies at last weekend�s G20 Meetings in Paris. Countries have responsibilities to each other, and we need to work with our partners overseas to find a solution to present problems. Four years into the crisis it is surely time to accept that the underlying problem is one of solvency not liquidity � solvency of banks and solvency of countries. Of course, the provision of additional liquidity support to countries or institutions in trouble can buy valuable time. But that time will prove valuable only if it is used to tackle the underlying problem. After the crisis began, it took a year before governments in Europe and the United States were persuaded that the problems of their banking sectors resulted not from a shortage of liquidity � that was merely the symptom � but from massively over-leveraged balance sheets. Eventually, in October 2008, banks were recapitalised, albeit, especially on the Continent, inadequately so. But the underlying problems of excessive debt have not gone away. As a result, markets are now posing new questions about the solvency of banks, and indeed of governments themselves. What were the causes of the unsustainable build-up of debt in Europe and elsewhere? They lay in the continuing imbalance between those economies running large current account surpluses and those running large current account deficits. Persistent trade surpluses in some countries and deficits in others did not reflect a flow of capital to countries with profitable investment opportunities, but to countries that borrowed to finance consumption or had lost competitiveness. The result was unsustainably high levels of consumption (whether public or private) in the United States, United Kingdom and a range of other advanced economies, and unsustainably low levels of consumption in China and other economies in Asia, and some advanced economies with persistent trade surpluses, such as Germany and   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                    1 Japan. The burden of debt will go on rising in the former group of countries until these spending patterns adjust and the latter group will find their loans eventually repaid in depreciated currencies, if at all. Surplus countries, a group which includes three of the world�s largest four economies, share a major responsibility to respond to our present dilemma by expanding domestic demand. By importing more they would provide deficit countries with the wherewithal to export and service debt repayments. When the crisis hit, the starting point was the need for a substantial rebalancing of demand and a repayment of debt. In the deficit economies, there was an inevitable tension between the short run need to stimulate demand to prevent rising unemployment and falling inflation, and the long run need to rebalance demand and reduce indebtedness. In January 2009, I described this as �the paradox of policy � almost any policy measure that is desirable now appears diametrically opposite to the direction in which we need to go in the long term�. The almost intractable challenge facing policy-makers is how to balance those short-run and long-run considerations. There is a long journey ahead before the world economy returns to a sustainable equilibrium, involving rebalancing and a reduction of debt burdens. For the time being, a significant degree of policy stimulus is appropriate to support demand. But that will delay and exacerbate the size of the adjustment ultimately required. It is hard to imagine a solution that does not involve actions in more than one country. In 2008�09, it was easy to coordinate international action in the G20 economies. In the face of a collapse in world trade even faster than that in the 1930s, countries needed no persuasion of the necessity of policy stimulus. But it has proved much harder to form a consensus on how to tackle the underlying problems. So, three years later, the imbalances in demand remain. Around the world, short-run stimulus packages of various kinds, and unsustainably low interest rates, have bought time. So far that time has not been used to deal with the underlying imbalances, or the weaknesses in bank and sovereign balance sheets. Four years after the financial crisis began, the foreign exchange reserve holdings of China are substantially larger than at the onset of the crisis. Markets now realise that before the crisis banks were seriously undercapitalised and so react in a volatile way to any news about the health of the banking system. And the indebtedness of governments around the world is certainly greater. Time is running out. So what is to be done? One way or another, domestic spending must be raised in the surplus countries and lowered in the deficit countries, relative to current trends. In the past, market- determined exchange rates have played an important role in rebalancing world demand and trade. Exchange rates are the natural safety valve, which can limit the extent of imbalances in demand across countries. Governments in the G7 agreed that intervention in the currency markets should be undertaken only when there was a collective view that exchange rates had become out of line with their longer run fundamental values. That reticence served us well. But over the past two decades, some governments, particularly in Asia and the euro area, have tried to fix exchange rates without putting in place mechanisms to ensure that competitiveness could be rebalanced by other means. That has contributed significantly to the problems facing us. It is crucial to the health of the world economy that we find ways of allowing competitiveness to adjust so that trade imbalances, and hence the present scale of indebtedness, can be reduced. Neither liquidity nor austerity are answers to the question of how to restore a loss of competitiveness. Dealing with these structural issues will take time. Meanwhile, how do we resolve the immediate crisis of confidence in some banks and sovereigns? Since the summer, there have been renewed concerns about the adequacy of the capital of banks in the euro area to absorb likely future losses, thus jeopardising their ability to raise funds. Wholesale funding dried up for many banks over the summer, and share prices of European banks are around 35% lower today than at the start of July. A transparent recognition of losses and a substantial injection of additional capital are necessary to restore market confidence. On its    2                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches own, however, such a policy will raise difficult political questions about the capacity of the weaker sovereigns to pay for any recapitalisation of their banks. Bank and sovereign solvency concerns are inextricably intertwined. In the end, the underlying solvency concerns require countries to adopt compatible policies so that they can credibly service their internal and external debts. What does this mean for our own economy? Our objective must be to steer the UK economy slowly back to a position of more normal interest rates and lower budget deficits. With a lower level of sterling and a credible plan to reduce the fiscal deficit over the medium term, we were on track. But the problems in the euro area and the marked slowing in the world economy have lengthened the period over which a return to normality is likely. 2011 has been the year of the reluctant recovery. Growth has disappointed, both here and abroad. Business and consumer confidence have fallen sharply, not only at home but also elsewhere in Europe and the United States. And the level of world trade in goods has stagnated. A slowing of the world economy, especially in the euro area, is a threat to our strategy of rebalancing and recovery of the UK economy. Despite the more competitive level of sterling, the recovery in our trade position is at risk of stalling. It is not surprising, therefore, that although unemployment has been broadly stable over the past two years at around 2� million, a rate of about 8%, it has risen in recent months, especially among young people. And total output remains around 4�% below its peak three years ago. Despite depressed levels of activity, inflation has been well above our 2% target. This morning�s confirmation that CPI inflation rose to 5.2% in September was in line with the expectations of the MPC at the time of our August Inflation Report. That is likely to be at, or close to, the peak, and we expect inflation now to start to fall back, as it did in the months following the peak in inflation in September 2008. Nevertheless, it will seem odd to many that at a time of high and rising inflation, the MPC has eased policy further. So let me explain why the Committee considered it necessary two weeks ago to resume its programme of asset purchases. In contrast to headline inflation, domestically generated inflation remains subdued � and on some measures barely above zero. Increases in energy prices, import prices and VAT account for the current high level of inflation. Once the effect of these temporary factors begins to dissipate, inflation should fall back sharply early next year. A persistent margin of spare capacity in the economy, and the recent deterioration in demand prospects linked to the crisis in financial markets, will add to the downward pressure on inflation in the medium term. So it is the outlook for inflation, rather than its current rate, which explains the MPC�s decision to resume asset purchases. Asset purchases work by increasing the amount of money in the economy. When the Bank buys assets, the people who sell the assets to us receive money which can then be used to buy other assets. In turn, the sellers become buyers of other assets, and so on indefinitely as the money is transferred from one account to another. The prices of assets that investors choose to buy go up, raising wealth and pushing down on yields. Those yields are the opposite side of the coin to the borrowing costs of companies. In these ways, the Bank�s purchases of assets increase demand in the economy. Some of you have asked why the MPC has focused largely on purchases of gilts, rather than securities issued by companies. The answer is three-fold. First, gilts are the only asset available in sufficient quantity such that the Bank can rapidly inject large amounts of money into the economy � �75 billion in the present case. Second, we have bought, and continue to buy, corporate securities, but this was designed to ensure that the corporate bond market functioned normally with the Bank acting as a temporary market-maker in a dysfunctional but previously liquid market. We were able to achieve that objective without the expenditure of large sums of money � unnecessary given the size of the market. Third, the Bank should not take decisions that discriminate between different companies and sectors. There may well be   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  3 good reasons for discriminating in some circumstances but that is a decision properly reserved to elected politicians. By buying gilts we leave the private sector to decide in which directions the money we create should percolate through the economy. Any positive impact of asset purchases will benefit all companies, large and small, through its impact on overall demand. Our programme of gilt purchases has helped large companies to reduce their reliance on the banking system and obtain finance directly from equity and corporate bond markets. In fact, the majority of Britain�s largest companies can borrow more cheaply in capital markets than the average of the largest six banks. Smaller and medium-sized companies (SMEs), however, are constrained to borrow through the banking system. And there is special concern about their ability to obtain credit � I share that concern based on my experience of meeting many such firms during visits to all parts of the United Kingdom and hearing reports from the Bank�s regional agents. We have made this point repeatedly at hearings of the Treasury Committee in Parliament. Over the past year the stock of SME borrowing has shrunk by around �5 billion or 5%. By far the most effective way of helping SMEs quickly would be to provide incentives for lending by existing banks because they can assess credit risk in a way that no other institution could do in the immediate future. Bank and Treasury officials are working together on such ideas. In the end, however, the shape and parameters of any scheme will be, and properly so, determined by the Government. Let me sum up. From the very beginning of the global crisis there has been a reluctance by governments to face up to the underlying solvency problems generated by apparently unending trade deficits with no mechanism, whether flexible exchange rates or some other means, for correcting these disequilibria. Those solvency problems have shown up on country and bank balance sheets. The initial reaction has always been to provide liquidity: through central banks or an extension of official lending by governments. Providing liquidity to buy time to devise and put in place a coherent response to the underlying problem can be not only valuable but necessary. But liquidity can never be the answer in itself. And if the time bought is not used then the size of the debt problem becomes larger and its cost is gradually transferred from private sector creditors to taxpayers. The main impediment to the strategy of rebalancing our economy is markedly slower growth in our major export markets, especially in the rest of Europe. That is why we are treading a fine line between stimulus to demand in the short run, and a rebalancing away from private and public consumption towards exports and import substitution in the longer run. Without monetary stimulus � low interest rates and large asset purchases � there is a risk that growth will stall and inflation fall below our symmetric 2% target. But easy monetary policy, by bringing forward spending from the future to the present, means that the ultimate adjustment of borrowing and spending will be even greater. That is our dilemma, and that of other deficit countries. The best way to escape this dilemma would be higher spending by the surplus countries � to make possible rebalancing by the deficit countries � and supply-side reforms in the deficit countries � to raise expected future incomes and ease the burden of debt repayments. Each country can put itself in a position to rebalance, as we have done in the UK. But in the absence of rebalancing, globally and especially in the euro area, we could be facing a recovery that is not merely reluctant but recalcitrant. Just as St. George�s Hall was reconstructed to meet the needs of Liverpool in the twenty-first century, so the international financial system must be reconstructed to ensure a return to prosperity. We can be optimistic � the fundamentals of the UK economy are strong. But without a rebalancing of spending in the world economy, a struggle between debtor and creditor countries will inflict economic pain on everyone. We must use the gravity of the global crisis to provoke a bold response. We acted together in 2009; we can do so again.     4                                                                          BIS central bankers� speeches"
2012-05-13	"Mervyn King: Monetary policy developments Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, on the 2012 BBC Today Programme Lecture, London, 2 May 2012.                                              *    *    *  Fifty years of rising living standards came to an end with the financial crisis. As a nation, we are now significantly worse off than we were four years ago. The crisis has cast a long shadow. Of course, the immediate challenge is to get our economy growing again. But fifty years from now will our grandchildren ask why we lacked the courage to put in place reforms to stop a crisis happening again? I hope not � and that�s why I want to speak to you tonight about the changes we need to make. Believe it or not, it�s more than seventy years since the Governor of the Bank of England last gave a talk on radio in peacetime. In March 1939, Montagu Norman spoke to the BBC in the wake of the economic slump that we now call the Great Depression. Just listen for a moment to the 1930s version of Evan Davis introducing the broadcast:         AUDIO INSERT:         �The Rt Honourable Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England,         speaking in the Empire Series on the City of London.� More the presenter of �yesterday� than �today�! In those days, the Bank of England, known affectionately as the �Old Lady of Threadneedle Street�, was a private bank performing the role of a central bank only by custom and practice. Here is how Norman described the relationship between the Bank of England and the Government in the 1930s:         AUDIO INSERT:         �The Bank of England has always been constitutionally a private body... but what         matters is not the position on paper but the position in practice. In monetary as in         other matters the Government of the day must have the final word and this is fully         recognised.� Today, the position on paper and the position in practice are the same. Our job is given to us by the Government and by Parliament. But for me, the story of the modern independent Bank of England began exactly fifteen years ago in early May 1997. It was a Bank Holiday Monday, immediately following the general election. After an early morning tennis match, I returned home to find a message from the Governor, Eddie George. He wanted to meet me in the Bank as soon as possible. An hour later we met in his office, alone in the imposing building known to most of you only by the facade shown on television. Eddie told me of his meeting that morning with the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, who had explained the proposal for Bank independence. It was something for which Eddie and I had worked for five years since Britain�s departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992. Now we had a chance to show what an independent central bank could do. Although far from clear at the time, the later decision to remove from the Bank of England the power to regulate banks would return to haunt us. Over the next decade, the new Monetary Policy Committee established a track record of low and remarkably stable inflation. In my first speech as Governor in 2003, I warned that this stability was unlikely to continue. And it didn�t. Within a few years, and despite low inflation, the advanced economies of the world were plunged into a financial crisis which led to the sharpest decline in world trade since the 1930s, recessions across the world, rising unemployment and the near collapse of our banking system.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                   1 So tonight I want to try to answer three questions. First, what went wrong? Second, what are the lessons? Third, what needs to change? Let me start by pointing out what did not go wrong. In the five years before the onset of the crisis, across the industrialised world growth was steady and both unemployment and inflation were low and stable. Whether in this country, the United States or Europe, there was no unsustainable boom like that seen in the 1980s; this was a bust without a boom. So what was the problem? In a nutshell, our banking and financial system overextended itself. That left it fragile and vulnerable to a sudden loss of confidence. The most obvious symptom was that banks were lending too much. Strikingly, most of that increase in lending wasn�t to families or businesses, but to other parts of the financial system. To finance this, banks were borrowing large amounts themselves. And this was their Achilles� heel. By the end of 2006, some banks had borrowed as much as �50 for every pound provided by their own shareholders. So even a small piece of bad news about the value of its assets would wipe out much of a bank�s capital, and leave depositors scurrying for the door. What made the situation worse was that the fortunes of banks had become closely tied together through transactions in complex and obscure financial instruments. So it was difficult to know which banks were safe and which weren�t. The result was an increasingly fragile banking system. So how did banks find themselves in such a precarious position? Banks are a vital part of our economy. They run the payment system, allowing us to pay our bills and receive our wages. They finance businesses investing in new ventures and families buying a new home. Without a banking system our economy would grind to a halt. Because of that, markets correctly believed that no government could let a bank fail since that would cause immense disruption to the economy. This meant that large banks in particular benefited from an implicit taxpayer guarantee, enabling them to borrow cheaply to finance their lending. In good times, banks took the benefits for their employees and shareholders, while in bad times the taxpayer bore the costs. For the banks, it was a case of heads I win, tails you � the taxpayer � lose. This cheap funding fuelled lending. Banks got bigger. In the UK, their balance sheets rose from around one-half to more than five times our national income in a generation. As the banks got bigger, so did the implicit subsidy � by the time of the crisis it reached many billions of pounds a year. The bigger banks became, the more they were seen as too important to fail, and the surer markets became that the taxpayer would bail them out. But there are only so many good loans and investments to be made. In order to expand, banks made increasingly risky investments. To make matters worse, they started making huge bets with each other on whether loans that had already been made would be repaid. The seeds of the eventual downfall of the financial system had been sown. As loans and investments went bad, those seeds started to sprout. In August 2007 came the moment when financial markets began to realise that the emperor had no clothes. The announcement by the French bank BNP Paribas that it would suspend repayments from two of its investment funds triggered a loss of confidence and a freezing of some capital markets. A month later, the crisis claimed its first victim when Northern Rock failed. In the months that followed, there was a steady procession of banking failures culminating in the collapse of the American bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Financial waters, already extremely chilly, then froze solid. Banks found it almost impossible to finance themselves because no-one knew which banks were safe and which weren�t. From the start of the crisis, central banks provided emergency loans but these amounted to little more than holding a sheet in front of the emperor to conceal the nakedness of the banks. They didn�t solve the underlying problem � banks needed not loans but injections of shareholders� capital in order to be able to absorb losses from the risky investments they had made. From the beginning of 2008, we at the Bank of England began to argue that UK banks needed extra capital � a lot of extra capital, possibly �100 billion or more. It wasn�t a popular message. But nine months later, market pressure forced banks to raise new capital or accept   2                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches it from the state. UK tax payers ended up owning large portions of two of our four biggest banks, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB, but almost all banks would have failed had not taxpayer support been extended. That bold action in October 2008 could have happened sooner. But the most important thing is that it was done. And the policy of recapitalising the banks was soon copied by other countries. Bailing out the banks came too late though to prevent the financial crisis from spilling over into the world economy. The realisation of the true state of the banking system led to a collapse of confidence around the world and a deep global recession. Over 25 million jobs disappeared worldwide. And unemployment in Britain rose by over a million. To many of you this will seem deeply unfair, and it is. I can understand why so many people are angry. It�s vital that we learn from the crisis. A good place to start is to ask, as the Queen famously did, �Why did no-one see this coming?� The answer is extremely simple: no-one believed it could happen. Recessions were supposed to follow booms and high inflation, not periods of steady and sustainable growth with low inflation. There seemed to be no reason to expect the worst recession since the 1930s. After the ravages of inflation in the 1970s � younger listeners might need to be reminded that inflation hit 27% in 1975 � it was I think understandable that we focussed on the need to bring inflation down. But conquering inflation was not enough to ensure stability. Although inflation was under control, fragilities were building in the banking system. On all sides there was a failure of imagination to appreciate the scale of the fragilities and their potential consequences. No-one could quite bring themselves to believe that in our modern financial system the biggest banks in the world could fall over. But they did. That isn�t to say we were blind to what was going on. For several years, central banks, including the Bank of England, had warned that financial markets were underestimating risks. So why, you might ask, did the Bank of England not do more to prevent the disaster? We should have. But the power to regulate banks had been taken away from us in 1997. Our power was limited to that of publishing reports and preaching sermons. And we did preach sermons about the risks. But we didn�t imagine the scale of the disaster that would occur when the risks crystallised. With the benefit of hindsight, we should have shouted from the rooftops that a system had been built in which banks were too important to fail, that banks had grown too quickly and borrowed too much, and that so-called �light-touch� regulation hadn�t prevented any of this. And in the crisis, we tried, but should have tried harder, to persuade everyone of the need to recapitalise the banks sooner and by more. We should have preached that the lessons of history were being forgotten � because banking crises have happened before. In the 1930s, the Great Depression saw a collapse of the banking system in the United States. So severe was it that President Franklin Roosevelt, only a week after his inauguration in March 1933, announced a bank holiday shutting the banks to provide a breathing space so that confidence could be restored. Here he is, in his first fireside chat, explaining banking to the American people:         AUDIO INSERT:          �My friends I want to talk for a few minutes with the people of the United States         about banking� We have had a bad banking situation. Some of our bankers         have shown themselves either incompetent or dishonest in their handling of the         people�s funds. They had used some money entrusted to them in speculation and         unwise loans. This was of course not true in the vast majority of our banks but it         was true in enough of them to shock the people of the United States for a time         into a sense of insecurity and to put them in a frame of mind where they did not         differentiate but seemed to assume that an act of a comparative few had tainted         them all. And so it became the government�s job to straighten out this situation         and to do it as quickly as possible and that job is being performed.�     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  3 We too have had a �bad banking situation�. Roosevelt showed bold and decisive political leadership in explaining to his listeners the reasons why they should not fear banks but trust their Government to ensure that the economy could be saved from the bank failures that had led to the Great Depression. For the sake of future generations, we too must be bold and decisive and, while the memory is fresh, learn the lessons from this crisis. Reform is essential. Three reforms top my list. The first concerns regulation of banks. Next year, the responsibility for regulating banks will return to the Bank of England. Next time we find ourselves with steady growth and low inflation, but with risks building in the financial sector, we shall be able to do something about it. The Bank�s new Financial Policy Committee will have the power to step in and prevent a hangover by taking away the punchbowl just as the party in the financial system is getting going. We believe that successful regulation means understanding and guarding against the big risks, not compliance with ever more detailed rules. That means focussing on the wood not the trees, looking not just at individual banks but also at how their fortunes are tied together with other banks and with the rest of the economy. For example, the biggest risk to banks at present stems from the troubles in the euro area. These are far from over. That�s why we�ve been pushing banks to pay out less to their shareholders and employees and instead retain profits as a cushion against possible losses. In future, to protect the rest of the economy from failures in the banking system, we need to ensure that more of banks� shareholders� own money is on the line, and banks rely correspondingly less on debt. If banks and their shareholders have more to lose, they will be more careful in choosing to whom they lend. And, when banks make losses, there is more of a cushion before the bank fails, and less chance that the taxpayer will have to foot the bill. Nevertheless, bank failures will happen from time to time � indeed failure is part and parcel of a prosperous market economy. So the second reform on my list aims to make sure badly run banks can fail safely � that is, without causing damage to ordinary depositors and the rest of the economy, and without billing the taxpayer. That requires a special legal framework to allow a failing bank to continue to provide its essential services while its finances are being sorted out. Such a framework is called a resolution mechanism. It�s precisely what was lacking when Northern Rock failed in 2007, leaving nationalisation as the only alternative. That painful lesson has been learnt, and the 2009 Banking Act introduced a resolution mechanism in Britain for the first time. But that won�t work for big global banks with operations around the world. So there is much more to do. The third reform is to restructure the banking system. In so doing we must recognise the crucial distinction between essential banking services to people like you and me, on the one hand, and complex and potentially risky trading activities, on the other. We don�t build nuclear power stations in densely populated areas; nor should we allow essential banking services and risky investment banking activities to be carried out in the same �too important to fail� bank. Last autumn, the Independent Commission on Banking, chaired by Sir John Vickers and comprising some of our most brilliant bankers and economists, published recommendations on how to do this. It�s vital that Parliament legislates to enact these proposals sooner rather than later. Regulation, resolution and restructuring of the banks are the three Rs of a new approach to make banking, and so our economy, safer. The three Rs will be central to the work of the Bank of England. And all of that will come on top of our responsibility for monetary policy to reduce inflation while supporting a gradual recovery of our battered economy. It�s the biggest challenge the Bank has faced for decades.     4                                                                            BIS central bankers� speeches We are up to the task. Already we see vested interests rise up to defend their bonuses and profits. But, as an independent central bank with over three centuries of history, we can resist those short-term pressures and take the longer view needed to prevent another crisis. Independence is, however, not the discretion to do as you wish, but the exercise of specific powers delegated to us by Parliament to meet a remit set by Parliament. So with independence come the responsibilities of transparency and accountability. Back in 1997, with independence to set interest rates, we revolutionised the openness of monetary policy. Our decisions, deliberations and even the disagreements within the Monetary Policy Committee are open to public scrutiny. I want to build on that track record to do the same for our new tasks because in everything the Bank does, I and my colleagues are conscious that we are accountable to you. The Bank of England has changed radically since that Bank Holiday Monday in 1997 when Eddie George and I sat in the Bank contemplating our new role, unaware of the roller coaster ride on which we were about to embark. The Bank will change again next year with its new responsibilities. But some things don�t change. Here again is Mr. Montagu Norman:         AUDIO INSERT:         �I would sum up the vital characteristics of the Bank as experience in affairs,         cooperation on all sides, independence of judgement. But you know these three         things � experience, cooperation, independence � are no good unless people         have confidence in you. I like to believe that the Bank, with its long history and         tradition, stands high in public esteem. But only by service to the community can         that esteem be maintained through times good and bad.� That�s true not just for Montagu Norman�s day, but for today too. The present crisis is far from over, as events in the euro area illustrate weekly. Our own economy is still not back to health. Although inflation has fallen back in recent months, it is still too high. And despite efforts to stimulate the economy, the recovery is proving slower than we had hoped. It will come. But dealing with the consequences of our �bad banking situation� is likely to be a long, slow process. Just as, if not more, important, in my view, is to look further to the future, to the economic possibilities for our grandchildren. To give them the prospect of economic stability, we must reform the three Rs of our financial system. We have an historic opportunity, and a duty, to do that. The day-to-day tasks of controlling inflation and curbing the excesses of the financial system will fall to the Bank of England. When, as it will, the economy returns to normal, our role will be to take away the punchbowl just as the next party is getting going. That won�t make us popular among bankers, politicians and even at times some of you, and it�s not supposed to. But it will, I hope, reflect the trust and confidence that the citizens of this country can place in the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street.

2012-12-25	"Mervyn King: Twenty years of inflation targeting Text of the Stamp Memorial Lecture by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, London School of Economics, London, 9 October 2012. All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                                       *     *     *  I am indebted to my colleagues in the Bank and on the Monetary Policy Committee for invaluable help and insightful comments on earlier drafts of this lecture, especially to David Aikman, Charles Bean, Nils Blythe, Alex Brazier, Spencer Dale, Iain de Weymarn, Richard Harrison, Andrew Hauser, David Miles and Tony Yates. In particular, I regard Tim Taylor as a co-author of the lecture, although he is absolved of any errors in the current draft.   Introduction I am delighted to be back at the School to deliver the Stamp Memorial Lecture. Lord Stamp was eminent in the worlds of both academic and public life. Among other achievements, he was an alumnus and a governor of the School, and a Director of the Bank of England. Following his untimely death, in an air raid in 1941, he was succeeded at the Bank by John Maynard Keynes. Keynes and Stamp often broadcast live discussions on the BBC which were published a week later in The Listener. Their conversations during the 1930s, at the height of the Great Depression, are eerily reminiscent of the enormous challenges we face today, as you can see from the following exchange in 1930: KEYNES: Is not the mere existence of general unemployment for any length of time an absurdity, a confession of failure, and a hopeless and inexcusable breakdown of the economic machine? STAMP: Your language is rather violent. You would not expect to put an earthquake tidy in a few minutes, would you? I object to the view that it is a confession of failure if you cannot put a complicated machine right all at once. KEYNES: In my opinion the return to the gold standard in the way we did it set our currency system an almost impossible task ... If prices outside this country had been going up since 1925 that would have done something to balance the effect on this country of the return to the gold standard. STAMP: Hush, Maynard; I cannot bear it. Remember, I am a Director of the Bank of England. In some respects our experience today is no different: putting right our economic machine is proving a slow and difficult task. But in the 1920s the Government made the task substantially harder by reinstating the gold standard at a rate that left sterling overvalued. Today, monetary policy is part of the solution, not part of the problem. That is thanks, in large part, to the monetary framework we have had in place since 1992. Twenty years ago today, on 9 October 1992, the newspapers reported that for the first time monetary policy in Britain would be based on an explicit target for inflation. Three weeks earlier, sterling had been forced out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). A new framework for monetary policy was needed. After keen debates within the Treasury and the Bank of England, the answer emerged � the inflation target. The essence of this new approach was the combination of a numerical target for inflation in the medium term and the flexibility to respond to shocks to the economy in the short run � and so the framework became known as flexible inflation targeting. It is time to reflect on twenty years� experience of inflation targeting; fifteen years of stability and five years of turbulence � the Great Stability and the Great Recession, shown in Table 1 and Charts 1�3. Over that period, monetary policy around the world has changed radically. Inflation targeting has spread to more than 30 countries. And the results in terms of low and stable inflation have been impressive. There have been pronounced reductions in the mean, variance and persistence of inflation in Britain and elsewhere. During the past twenty years, annual consumer   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                  1 price inflation in this country has averaged 2.1%, remarkably close to the 2% target and well below the averages of over 12% a year in the 1970s and nearly 6% a year in the 1980s. 1 But did we pay too high a price for this achievement in lowering inflation? After fifteen years of apparent success, the past five years of financial crisis and turmoil in the world economy have raised serious questions about the adequacy of inflation targeting. We don�t have to look far to see that the costs of financial instability are huge. In Britain, total output is today some 15% below an extrapolation of its pre-crisis trend, and that gap is likely to persist for some time yet. 2 In the light of such costs, should monetary policy go beyond targeting price stability and also target financial stability? And should the present financial crisis lead us to question the intellectual basis of monetary policy as practised in most of the industrialised world today? Those questions are the subject of tonight�s lecture.  The story of inflation targeting But let us start at the beginning. Shortly after the adoption of inflation targeting, my predecessor but one, Lord Kingsdown (Robin Leigh-Pemberton as he then was), gave an important speech at the London School of Economics � indeed in this room � entitled �The Case for Price Stability�. 3 I remember it vividly � for I had been involved in drafting it. It was an exciting time; we were reconstructing British monetary policy after the trauma of forced exit from the ERM. In those days, of course, the Chancellor set monetary policy and the Bank of England played only a behind the scenes role. But the role of the Bank was about to change � first with the Inflation Report in February 1993, which gave the Bank its own public voice, and then with independence for the Bank and the creation of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in 1997. The inflation target was born out of the experience that high and variable inflation was very costly to reduce and that only a policy based on domestic considerations would be credible. The objective of monetary policy in the medium term would unambiguously be price stability. As the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, put it �we wish to reduce inflation to the point where expected changes in the average price level are small enough and gradual enough that they do not materially affect business and household financial plans�. The idea that there is a long-run trade-off between price stability and employment had long since been abandoned. That intellectual revolution, associated with the names of Friedman, Phelps and Lucas, had stood the test of time and formed the foundations of inflation targeting. The initial reception of the inflation target among economists and commentators alike was distinctly mixed. As the Financial Times put it in a leader published twenty years ago today, �the Chancellor�s speech was as economically thin as it was politically disappointing�. The critics argued that the new framework was inadequate to control inflation. They were to be proved wrong. Over the previous twenty years inflation had been the single biggest problem facing the UK economy, peaking at 27% a year in 1975. Over the subsequent twenty years, inflation, as I mentioned earlier, would average only 2.1%. From the outset, inflation targeting was conceived as a means by which central banks could improve the credibility and predictability of monetary policy. The overriding concern was not to eliminate fluctuations in consumer price inflation from year to year, but to reduce the degree of uncertainty over the price level in the long run because it is from that unpredictability that the real costs of inflation stem.     1     The continuously compounded annual rate of inflation (as measured by the CPI) from August 1992 to August 2012     was 2.1%, and the average of the annual rates each August over that period is 2.2%. 2     Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) present an array of evidence to document the cost of prolonged recessions following     financial crises. 3     Leigh-Pemberton (1992).   2                                                                                    BIS central bankers� speeches The improvement in credibility of policy is shown by the fact that whereas in 1992 expected inflation, as measured by the difference between yields on conventional and index-linked gilts, was close to 6%, today the same measure is around 2� %. Predictability of the price level is greater because over a long period inflation has on average been close to the target 4. Even if inflation deviates from target � as will often be the case � it is expected to return to target, and so inflation expectations are anchored. 5 That is why since 2007 the UK has been able to absorb the largest depreciation of sterling since the Second World War, as well as very large rises in oil and commodity prices, with an increase in inflation to an average of only 3.2% over the past five years and without dislodging long-term inflation expectations. So the framework has been tested and has proved its worth. But the current crisis has demonstrated vividly that price stability is not sufficient for economic stability more generally. Low and stable inflation did not prevent a banking crisis. Did the single-minded pursuit of consumer price stability allow a disaster to unfold? Would it have been better to accept sustained periods of below or above target inflation in order to prevent the build up of imbalances in the financial system? Is there, in other words, sometimes a trade-off between price stability and financial stability? 6  The intellectual foundations of monetary policy The experience of the past five years suggests that we reassess the intellectual framework underpinning monetary policy. 7 The emergence of inflation targeting, and the successful results in the form of the Great Stability, coincided with the development of the so-called New Keynesian consensus on macroeconomic theory. This framework offered a theoretical foundation for flexible inflation targeting. Central to the New Keynesian view is the assumption that some prices are �sticky� and adjust slowly. That assumption has two implications. First, high inflation produces inefficient changes in relative prices. As a result, there is a cost to inflation. Second, when central banks change nominal interest rates they also affect real interest rates, and so encourage households and businesses to switch expenditure from today to tomorrow or, as in present circumstances, the other way round. In this way, central banks can, in the model at least, offset shocks to aggregate demand. But there are shocks to supply as well as demand. External cost shocks sometimes drive inflation away from the target, as we saw in recent years with rises in world energy and food prices. Because other prices are �sticky�, attempts to keep inflation at target all the time would result in inefficient fluctuations in output. There is, therefore, a trade-off between stabilising inflation and stabilising output. Following a cost shock, it is sensible to bring inflation back to target gradually.    4     The difference between inflation and price level targeting is often exaggerated in the literature, as discussed in King     (1999). 5     Since the start of the crisis, there has been a convergence between the practice of flexible inflation targeting and the     practice of dual-mandate central banks. The Federal Reserve quietly adopted a 2% inflation target in January, and     Japan did the same with the announcement in February of a numerical goal for inflation of 1% a year. This practical     convergence means that there is now little steam behind the question of the relative merits of the two approaches to     the target, or mandate, for central banks. 6     A number of commentators have questioned the wisdom of flexible inflation targeting. For example, Eichengreen et al     (2011) and Barker (2012). The first of those asserts that �the traditional separation, in which monetary policy targets     price stability and regulatory policies target financial stability, and the two sets of policies operate largely     independently of each other, is no longer tenable� (op. cit. p. 5). 7     The most complete analysis of the New Keynesian model as applied to monetary policy is Woodford (2003). It is no     accident that in official circles the most serious questioning of the foundations of inflation targeting emanates from the     Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). The �lost decade� has prompted an interesting     series of speeches by the BoJ�s governor, Masaaki Shirakawa. And the BIS, freed from day-to-day involvement with     the setting of interest rates, has long argued that monetary policy and financial policy cannot be considered     separately.   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                        3 In this, by now conventional, framework, the proper objective of monetary policy is to minimise the variability of inflation around the target rate and the variability of output (or employment) around a sustainable path consistent with stable inflation. 8 Such an objective means that the central bank is effectively choosing a trade-off between the volatility of inflation and the volatility of output. This is sometimes described as choosing a point on the Taylor frontier showing, as in Chart 4, the combinations of lowest volatility of inflation for a given volatility of output. 9 That optimal choice leads to a policy reaction function describing how the central bank responds to shocks hitting the economy. 10 The success of the New Keynesian framework was that it showed how the long run objective of price stability could be implemented by an appropriate central bank policy reaction function. It stressed the importance of expectations and credibility, to which too little attention had been paid during the inflationary episodes of the 1970s and 1980s. But inevitably, as with all models, the basic New Keynesian model omits a number of key factors. The treatment of expectations is simplified, and neglects the possibility that expectations themselves may be a source of fluctuations, rather than simply reflecting changes elsewhere in the economy. Sentiment can vary, misperceptions occur, and people can change the heuristics they use to cope with a complex world. 11 And it lacks an account of financial intermediation, so money, credit and banking play no meaningful role. Those omissions obviously limit the ability of the model to help us understand the trade-offs between monetary policy and financial stability. Although there is a, by now extensive, literature on financial frictions, including attempts to incorporate them in New Keynesian models, it turns out that such extensions make little difference to the propagation of shocks, to optimal policy, or to the quantitative conclusion that overwhelmingly the most important objective remains inflation stabilisation. 12 There is no doubt that financial frictions such as asymmetric information, credit constraints, and costly monitoring of borrowers, to name but a few, are an important part of the story of how crises happen and why they impact on output. But those models do not provide a convincing account of the gradual build-up of debt, leverage and fragility that characterises the run-up to financial crises. 13     8      This specification of the objective function can be derived as an approximation to the maximisation of the welfare,      defined over consumption and leisure, of a representative consumer with an infinite horizon (see Rotemberg and      Woodford, 1997). 9      The frontier is named after the US economist John Taylor. 10      To implement such a policy reaction function requires an empirical judgement about the factors that drive the volatility      of both inflation and output. In principle, these should include those factors in the banking and financial system,      including movements in asset prices, that generate fluctuations in demand and output and affect the way in which      shocks are transmitted through the economy. In practice, however, rather little attention was paid to the role of the      banking system in determining inflation and output. 11      Brazier et al. (2008). 12      The relevant literature tries to integrate standard or workhorse models of financial frictions (such as the      Bernanke-Gertler (1989) model of the financial accelerator and the Kiyotaki-Moore (1997) model of credit cycles) into      a New Keynesian �sticky� price model. Examples of this literature include Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1999),      Curdia and Woodford (2009) and Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010). The only way the addition of a financial sector �matters�      in these models is if we contemplate exogenous shocks to the financial friction itself. That is not very instructive.      Several interesting papers presented at a Federal Reserve conference in Washington in March 2012 analysed a wide      variety of potential �financial frictions� that might create externalities that would justify a policy intervention. My      concern is that there seems no limit to the ingenuity of economists to identify such market failures, but no one of      these frictions seems large enough to play a part in a macroeconomic model of financial stability. So it is not      surprising that it has proved hard to find examples of frictions that generate quantitatively interesting trade-offs      between price and financial stability � the finding in these models is that overwhelmingly the most important objective      remains stabilisation of inflation. 13      Focussing on small deviations around the linearization of the steady-state of a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium      model helped to divert attention away from the gradual build up of big risks.   4                                                                                            BIS central bankers� speeches Existing models, then, do not tell us why stability today may come at the expense of instability tomorrow. Perhaps we should heed the advice of Ricardo Caballero, who has written that �macroeconomic research has been in �fine-tuning� mode within the local maximum of the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium world, when we should be in �broad-exploration� mode�. 14 So let me now move into broad exploration mode and give three examples in which a trade-off between monetary and financial stability might arise, and which could in theory justify a policy of aiming off the inflation target in order to reduce the risk of future financial instability, before I turn to whether such a policy would have been appropriate before the crisis. The first is where misperceptions about future incomes persist and are embodied in key prices, such as the exchange rate and long-term interest rates. Households, businesses, and banks can all make big mistakes when forming judgements about the future, and make spending decisions today which they will come to regret when their true lifetime budget constraints are revealed. There is no mechanism for ensuring that misperceptions about the sustainable level of spending are corrected quickly. It may take many years before those beliefs are invalidated by experience. So an equilibrium pattern of spending and saving can emerge that is stable temporarily but not sustainable indefinitely. And misaligned prices may reinforce mistaken beliefs if people are using market prices to extract signals about future incomes and consumption opportunities. Evidence of the persistence of misperceptions can be seen in the imbalances in the world, and especially the European, economies. I do not mean to imply that when economic agents make these mistakes they are behaving irrationally. Rather that in a world of intrinsic uncertainty it is far from obvious how to make decisions. The assumption of rational expectations is very helpful for economists when trying to understand the implications of their own models � it is a discipline to prevent the drawing of arbitrary conclusions. In practice, however, households are on their own in a highly uncertain and complex world where they are learning from experience. When it comes to decisions about how much to spend and how much to save, expectations of future incomes are crucial. In the absence of a complete set of markets for future consumption goods � and labour � there is no mechanism to ensure that decisions today, and so the implied plans for tomorrow, will be consistent with the possibilities available in the future. If revisions to expectations of future incomes are uncorrelated across households, then aggregate spending will be relatively stable. The problem comes when many households have similarly over-optimistic views about the future. Aggregate spending and borrowing can then be unsustainably high and lead to an inevitable correction at an unpredictable date when reality dawns. Financial markets both reflect and propagate that common degree of optimism. Sentiment and animal spirits can change very quickly. Examples include the extrapolation of past growth rates of incomes or asset prices into the future when in fact they reflect an adjustment of the level of income or asset price to a new equilibrium. At the time, the MPC argued that the rise in the ratio of house prices to incomes in the years leading up to 2007 reflected a fall in long-term real interest rates � in other words, an adjustment to a new equilibrium house price to income ratio. But if households extrapolated past increases in house prices into the future, then they may have mistakenly inferred that future incomes too would be higher, and so spending and borrowing more than could be sustained. Similar arguments could be made about the reaction of businesses and households to the rise in the sterling effective exchange rate in the late 1990s, and I shall return to this later. Since long-term interest rates in financial markets are, if anything, even lower today the question of sustainability has not yet been resolved. Misperceptions mean that unsustainable levels of spending, and associated levels of debt, can build up over many years. When those misperceptions are eventually corrected, they lead to sudden large changes in asset values, a synchronised de-leveraging of balance sheets, a large downward correction to spending and    14      Caballero (2010).   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                        5 output, and defaults. 15 Keynesian policies to smooth the path of adjustment by supporting aggregate demand can help in the short run, but their effectiveness is limited by the fact that a significant adjustment to spending � from consumption to investment � is required. If policymakers can, first, identify misperceptions, and, second, correct them by changes in monetary policy � both highly uncertain empirically � then there is indeed a trade-off between hitting the inflation target and reducing the chance of a financial crisis down the road. But are central banks less prone to misperceptions than others? My second example concerns what Masaaki Shirakawa, Governor of the Bank of Japan calls the �cycle of confidence�. He argues that success breeds confidence, and eventually over-confidence and complacency, leading to collapse. Such ideas are closely associated with the work of Hyman Minsky and others. Minsky set out a �financial instability hypothesis� in which a period of stability encourages exuberance in credit markets and subsequent instability. 16 Perhaps the experience of unprecedented stability in the UK and world economies before the crisis dulled the senses and bred complacency about future risks. I talked about this when I christened the period leading up to 2003 the nice (non-inflationary consistently expansionary) decade. 17 The point of that speech was that the following decade was unlikely to be as nice. And, of course, it wasn�t. But the point didn�t get home, and the financial system became more and more fragile as the leverage of our banking system rose to unprecedented levels. The experience of continuing stability may have sowed the seeds of its own destruction. That idea has been explored recently in an interesting new book by Nassim Taleb. 18 He argues that the opposite of fragility is not resilience or robustness, but �antifragility�, that is a state in which people or institutions thrive on volatility, shocks to the system and risk. We go to the gym to stress our muscles in order to strengthen them; occasional seismic activity may prevent a more damaging earthquake. Frequent exposure to shocks and surprises may improve the way people learn about and manage risks. In a complex world, we are �better at doing than we are at thinking�, in Taleb�s words. Unless we train and practice at coping with bad outcomes we may fail to respond in the right way to adverse shocks when they come. �Antifragility� does not imply that it might be desirable to engineer small recessions in order to head off a deep depression. We know far too little about the economy to attempt any such strategy, and in a world of intrinsic uncertainty we rely on heuristics � simplified rules of thumb � to guide our behaviour. But it offers a warning of the dangers of believing that the role of monetary policy is to offset all shocks. Rather than pretend that we can forecast the future, a more intelligent response is to reinforce the resilience of those parts of the financial system that we cannot permit to fail and encourage entry and exit in a free market in other parts. It is clear that we need to understand more about how stability affects risk-taking, leverage, and the �cycle of confidence�. My third example relates to the so-called �risk taking� channel of monetary policy. 19 Short-term policy rates, especially when they are, as now, exceptionally low, may encourage investors to take on more risk than they would otherwise wish as they �search for yield�. 20 Financial institutions with   15      There is a substantial literature on debt deflation, including Fisher (1933), Minsky (1982b), Bernanke and Gertler      (1990), King (1993), Eggertsson and Krugman (2012). 16      Minsky (1982a). More recently Geanakoplos (2010) has set out a theory of what he calls the �leverage cycle�. Again,      this cycle is driven by sentiment, and has a self-reinforcing dynamic. In good times leverage increases and that helps      to drive up asset prices as optimistic investors can access financing on easy terms. But at some point bad news puts      the process into reverse. Losses trigger margin calls which force asset sales and cause a collapse in asset prices.      The reason that such a cycle is costly is due to a series of externalities and market imperfections. 17      King (2003). 18      Taleb (2012). 19      A term coined by Borio and Zhu (2008). 20      Rajan (2005) argues that the �search for yield� was an important ingredient in the story of the crisis.   6                                                                                              BIS central bankers� speeches long-term commitments (pension funds and insurance companies, for example) need to match the yield they promised on their liabilities, with the yield on their assets. When interest rates are high, they can invest in safe assets to generate the necessary revenue. When interest rates are low, however, they are forced to invest in riskier assets to continue to meet their target nominal rate of return. That tends to push down risk premia and lower the price of borrowing. Other investors too find it difficult to accept that in a world of low nominal and real interest rates equilibrium rates of return will not meet their previous expectations. 21 If these mechanisms are important, the financial cycle may be heavily influenced by monetary policy, especially when interest rates are low. That also creates the possibility of a trade-off between monetary and financial stability. All three examples suggest that the conventional analysis of the trade-off between the volatility of inflation and the volatility of output is likely to be far too optimistic. Does this add up to a case for �leaning against the wind� of rising asset prices rather than waiting to �mop� up after the bust? Certainly we have seen that monetary policy cannot fully offset the effects of financial crises for two reasons. First, crises may impact output before the response of monetary policy is felt. Second, crises typically reduce potential supply growth, for example by disrupting the supply of credit to productive firms. A failure to take financial instability into account creates an unduly optimistic view of where the Taylor frontier lies, especially when it is based on data drawn from a period of stability. Relative to a Taylor frontier that reflects only aggregate demand and cost shocks, the addition of financial instability shocks generates what I call the Minsky-Taylor frontier, shown in Chart 5. This reflects the influence of misperceptions, financial cycles and the search for yield. On the Minsky-Taylor curve, for a given degree of inflation variability, output is more volatile in the long run than on the simple Taylor curve. Ignoring financial instability might mean choosing a policy reaction function that is believed to imply a trade-off at point O in Chart 5. In fact, the true trade-off is given by point P. Once that is understood then the optimal policy reaction function might well change and correspond to a trade-off at point Q. 22 The examples I have given suggest the possibility that there is a trade-off between meeting the inflation target in the short run and reducing the risk of a financial crisis in the long run. To shed light on whether that possibility warrants a change to the way we implement inflation targeting, I want now to conduct a counter-factual thought experiment and ask whether monetary policy before 2007 might have moderated the crisis if it had not simply pursued a target for inflation.  A counter-factual monetary policy 1997�2007 I want to ask whether, with the benefit of hindsight, monetary policy should have been set differently during the period of the so-called Great Stability. Should interest rates have been higher during that period in order to mitigate some of the growth of credit, rise in asset prices, and increase in the leverage of the banking system? Many commentators today seem to think that the answer is clearly yes � though I seem to remember that fewer said so at the time � and most of the     21      Another mechanism, working through banks� leverage, is posited by Adrian and Shin (2011). They show that if banks      target a Value-at-Risk constraint, then monetary policy loosening can increase risk taking. The reduction in policy      rates boosts asset prices (by lowering discount rates), and also steepens the yield curve which tends to increase      banks� net interest margins. Other things equal, this reduces bank leverage by boosting the net worth of the bank and      increasing its ongoing profitability. To hit its target Value-at-Risk the bank expands its balance sheet, purchasing      assets and pushing up the price of assets thereby amplifying the effect of the initial monetary policy loosening. 22      There is a further consideration that is even more intriguing. The existence of misperceptions, the �cycle of      confidence� and the use of heuristics, and the search for yield, all create direct welfare costs over and above their      impact on inflation and output because they distort household behaviour. This means that financial instability matters      for welfare independently of its effect on output and inflation. So policy is directed at reducing not only the volatility of      output and inflation but also the distortions to household decisions. That introduces a third dimension to the welfare      analysis and the constraint on policy-makers is represented by a three-dimensional Minsky-Taylor surface.

2013-01-23	"Mervyn King: Monetary policy developments Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the CBI Northern Ireland Mid-Winter Dinner, Belfast, 22 January 2013.                                            *    *    *  I am delighted to be in Belfast to deliver my final regional speech as Governor. After the Bank obtained independence in 1997, we decided to establish a physical presence in Northern Ireland for the first time. And I was able to announce the opening of the Agency when I visited Belfast in May 1999. Since then the links between the business community and the Agency have gone from strength to strength. None of this would have been possible without the commitment of a remarkable group of Bank of England Agents: first, Nigel Falls, then Phil Eckersley and now Frances Hill, all supported by Gillian Anderson, today the Deputy Agent. During that same visit, I met with a group of politicians from right across the political spectrum. They were surprisingly eager to talk with, not at, each other � because they wanted to exchange views about the economic future of Northern Ireland, and to get away, at least for a while, from the divisive nature of daily politics. You would have been hard put to identify the affiliation of those politicians from their views on how to promote economic prosperity in Northern Ireland. And this is the key to the future. In my regular visits, I have criss-crossed the Province and come to realise how important is the business community as the agent of change and reconciliation. It is a challenge to which you continue to rise with spirit and determination. And it is why I enjoy coming here to meet with you, to learn about your progress, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the Province. I am conscious that there are significant differences between the economies of Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. Tonight, however, I want to focus mainly on the economic outlook for the United Kingdom as a whole. What are the Bank of England�s diagnosis, prescription and prognosis for the UK economy? At one level, the diagnosis is self-evident. Growth has been much weaker than most commentators expected. In fact, according to the official figures, there has been barely any growth at all over the past 2� years. Unemployment, at a rate of almost 8%, is markedly higher than the level of around 5�% before the crisis. And inflation, despite its fall over the past fifteen months from over 5% to around 2�%, remains above our 2% target. Living standards have been squeezed for longer than at any time in living memory. Much of this reflects the inevitable correction of exuberance on the part of borrowers and lenders, the conditions for which were created by the failure to tackle the global imbalances that left most major countries with unsustainable exchange rates, unsustainable paths of consumption, saving and borrowing, and unsustainably low long-term real interest rates. Our economy too needs to rebalance as it recovers, and that affects the pace of recovery. Although the downturn in UK GDP from the peak in 2008 to the trough in 2009, at around 6%, was broadly similar to that in most other industrialised countries, our recovery has been noticeably slower, with a cumulative rise in output from the middle of 2009 of only about 3�% compared with 6% or more in many other countries. But has the process of recovery and rebalancing been derailed or merely delayed? With the right prescription we can ensure that it has been only delayed. Three factors in particular have adversely affected the pace of recovery in the UK. The first is an especially deep and protracted squeeze on the level of many people�s real take-home pay. Over the past four years, money wages have on average been rising at less than 2% a year. And higher energy and food prices, as well as tax changes and a lower exchange rate, passing through to the level of consumer prices, have all contributed to the squeeze. On average, real take-home pay is no higher than back in 2004. That has been responsible for   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                 1 an unusually weak recovery in consumer spending which, after falling initially by some 7%, is still more than 4% below its peak. The result is a large number of vacant retail premises � visible here in Belfast, as elsewhere. The second factor is the extent to which the balance sheets of the major UK banks had grown before the crisis hit, and had been financed primarily by borrowing. So the subsequent reduction in bank lending � the deleveraging � was greater here than in many other countries. That deleveraging has as its counterpart a reduction in the amount of (broad) money in the economy and a reduced willingness on the part of banks to expand lending to finance the recovery. And the third is the crisis in our main trading partner � the euro area � where the near term outlook is weak, and the longer term prospects for tackling the evident fault lines in the monetary union uncertain. The former means that our current account deficit has remained stubbornly high, and the latter is holding back corporate investment With a disappointingly slow recovery, and unemployment one million higher than before the crisis, the main aim of economic policy has been to generate both a recovery and a rebalancing of the economy, and bring unemployment down without putting at risk hard-won medium-term price stability. The Bank of England has played its part by administering a powerful combination of medicines. First, interest rates have been at all-time lows, with Bank Rate at near zero now for nearly four years. This has lowered the rate at which families, businesses, the government and banks can borrow. Second, the Bank�s programme of asset purchases has prevented what might have been a serious contraction of the money supply. An enormous amount of new money has been injected into the economy, now amounting to about 25% of annual GDP. This was crucial in avoiding a depression. And, in addition to these monetary policy measures, we introduced last summer, in conjunction with the Treasury, the Funding for Lending Scheme to provide cheap funding to banks for a period of four years to enable them to finance lending to UK households and businesses. The Scheme has already reduced banks� funding costs: for example, major UK banks� senior unsecured bond spreads have fallen by around 125 basis points. And the availability and price of credit for many borrowers has improved. But there remains spare capacity � certainly in the labour market. So should we do more to revive the patient? The short answer is yes � but the harder question is, what? In many countries, including the UK, fiscal policy is constrained by the size of government indebtedness, and monetary policy has come to be seen as the only game in town. Monetary stimulus is already very powerful. Markets expect policy rates to remain at exceptionally low levels for a considerable period of time. Of course, we could provide even more monetary stimulus through further asset purchases. And we will continue to assess the benefits and costs of further reductions in overnight interest rates. Be in no doubt that we are ready to provide more stimulus if it is needed. Relying on generalised monetary stimulus alone, however, is not a panacea. Monetary policy works, at least in part, by providing incentives to households and businesses to bring forward spending from the future to the present. But that reduces spending plans tomorrow. And when tomorrow arrives, an even larger stimulus is required to bring forward yet more spending from the future. As time passes, larger and larger doses of stimulus are required. We are not in a typical post-war business cycle recession. And, as with many medicines, there are side-effects from the prolonged use of monetary stimulus. With long bond yields at unsustainably low levels, there is a risk to financial stability. Real interest rates (that is, returns adjusted for expected inflation) on government bonds are negative out to a horizon of 25 years. That is not consistent with a sustainable economic recovery and a return to more normal levels of interest rates.   2                                                                          BIS central bankers� speeches A long period of exceptionally low interest rates may also encourage excessive risk-taking, leading to vulnerabilities in important financial institutions. So if we cannot rely on monetary stimulus alone, what additional policies should we consider? The right prescription now is a programme that complements monetary stimulus with measures to promote the necessary long-run rebalancing of the economy, enabling us to return eventually to more normal levels of interest rates. Only then can we return to a sustainable growth path. We must not be inactive, but we must be selective in order to be effective. What are those other policies? They come under three headings: restoring confidence in our banks, reforms to raise the future potential supply of our economy, and changes in the world economy and exchange rates. Much has already been done to fix the banking system in this country. And there has been a real improvement in the position of UK banks. Capital ratios have risen, leverage has fallen, liquidity has improved, and bank funding costs have fallen sharply, especially since the announcement of the Funding for Lending Scheme last summer and an improvement in market sentiment towards the euro area. Banks are now overflowing with liquidity, largely as a result of the enormous increase in central bank reserves held by commercial banks. Yet there remains anxiety in markets about the resilience of UK banks. That is affecting the terms on which banks can obtain funding and so their ability to lend to the rest of the economy. Some argue that UK banks� capital ratios compare favourably with many of their continental counterparts. They do, and we should welcome that. But there is only one simple test of whether UK banks now have sufficient capital. It is whether they can convince investors that it is safe to provide them with funding at reasonable spreads over Bank Rate without central bank support. As the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) noted in its recent Review, UK banks are still some way from being able to convince the market in this respect. Regulators, who from 1 April will be in the Bank of England�s new Prudential Regulation Authority, are now working hard to ensure that banks are making adequate provisions for future losses, the likely costs of regulatory penalties and compensation to customers, and stating the riskiness of their assets in a more prudent way. A lesson from past crises, and also from this one, is that it is important to act now rather than hope that problems will go away of their own accord. As the FPC said last December, it is likely that banks will be required either to raise more capital or to restructure their businesses or exposures, and the FPC will review the position in March. There is no single remedy appropriate to all banks. With proper implementation, there is no reason why the two banks with significant state shareholdings could not largely be back in the private sector within a relatively short period. After all, in the United States banks that received state support are already back in private hands. Restoring our banking system to full � and transparent � health is only one of the structural changes that will be necessary to rebalance the economy. Structural reforms are the familiar mantra of all international meetings. As a means of compensating for a large loss of competitiveness they are too slow acting to be effective. But in current circumstances they are, for the UK, a necessary complement to the other measures I have described. Since the crisis began real wages have fallen by almost 10% � a large but necessary adjustment to make the production of tradable goods and services more attractive than non-tradables, and to stabilise the public finances. Supply reforms can make that adjustment more palatable, and, by raising expected future incomes, they increase the rate of return on new investment and encourage spending, both investment and consumption, today. It cannot be for a central bank to design a programme of such supply initiatives, but in economic terms there has never been a better time for supply-side reform.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                   3 The need to rebalance the economy means that all of the policy responses I have discussed will be required to restore the economy to full health. The final part of the prescription is outside the UK�s control. Engineering a recovery while our main trading partner is in a downturn is a difficult undertaking. We would all benefit from a resolution of the problems in the euro area. The actions by the ECB have brought a period of calm to financial markets, and so bought more time. But, as the President of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, has said on many occasions, only politicians can produce lasting solutions to the problems facing the euro area, whether by restoring competitiveness to the periphery or creating a framework for a transfer union. The euro area illustrates a major problem for the world economy as a whole � the need to rebalance domestic demand away from countries with trade deficits to those with trade surpluses. Without that, an increasing number of countries are coming to the view that only a lower real exchange rate will provide the stimulus to demand that their economies require. Several have taken action to achieve that end. That is a recipe for competitive depreciations, what some have called �currency wars�. Yet the existing configuration of exchange rates is unlikely to deliver stability. For almost two decades the world has struggled with, but failed to resolve, this problem. So it is hard to be optimistic about how easy it will be to manage the resulting tensions. The fall in our own exchange rate, of some 25% between late 2007 and the beginning of 2009, has reduced the gap between our exports and imports in real terms from around 3�% of GDP to around 1�%. But the persistence of the current account deficit is evidence that an adjustment of sterling of that order was certainly necessary for a full rebalancing of our economy. With that diagnosis and prescription, what then is the prognosis: what does 2013 hold in store for the UK economy? On Friday we shall see the first official estimate for growth in the fourth quarter of last year. As we saw throughout last year, quarter to quarter changes in growth rates tell us little about the underlying strength of the economy, affected as they are by one-off factors such as the Diamond Jubilee and the Olympics. The continuation of the �zig-zag� pattern of growth rates last year means that, whether negative or positive, growth in Q4 will almost certainly turn out to have been considerably weaker than in Q3. Inflation too has disappointed recently. It is set to remain above target for much of this year � in part because administered and regulated prices, such as those for electricity and gas, rail fares and university tuition fees, will put unusually strong upward pressure on inflation. Those prices are less susceptible to the influence of monetary policy, and will soon be contributing around one percentage point to measured inflation. So prices set in the market sector of the economy will need to rise by only about 1% a year if inflation is to meet the 2% target. That is a tall order. But the Monetary Policy Committee can respond flexibly by looking through the effects of administered prices as long as market-generated inflation pressures remain subdued. There are good reasons to suppose that a gentle recovery is underway. Broad money growth, adjusted for transactions between financial intermediaries, is now rising at around 4�% a year, a rate that should, if maintained, show up in a recovery during 2013. Credit conditions have improved, and should improve further as the impact of the Funding for Lending Scheme kicks in. Mortgage rates have fallen, especially for high loan to value mortgages. Big companies have large holdings of cash and ready access to capital markets. Equity prices are nearly 10% higher than last January. If the policy prescriptions I mentioned earlier were adopted, then confidence that we were moving in the right direction should translate into higher business and housing investment, and underpin the recovery. Recent actions by central banks and governments in a number of industrialised countries have raised questions about the frameworks within which monetary policy is being conducted. In the UK, the inflation target was introduced almost 21 years ago, and it has now come of age. It would be sensible to review the arrangements for setting monetary policy.   4                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches Last October I reviewed the first two decades of experience with the inflation target. In that speech, I argued that there were times when a concern for financial stability might justify deviating from the inflation target, but that policies aimed directly at preventing too rapid an expansion of financial balance sheets, of the kind now available to the Bank�s Financial Policy Committee, might be a less costly way, in terms of lost output and employment, of achieving overall stability. And I also argued that price stability in the long run remained essential for economic success. That is why price stability is the central plank of the remit given to the MPC by the Chancellor. The other part of the remit makes clear that we are not expected to pursue 2% inflation in the short run whatever the cost � it recognises that attempting to hit the inflation target at all times may cause �undesirable volatility in output�. The remit overall has become known as �flexible inflation targeting�. It is a way of trading off output and inflation variability in the short run, while ensuring that inflation remains on track to return to the 2% target. Until the crisis, there appeared to be no real tension between hitting the inflation target and ensuring steady growth. More recently, we have had to make difficult choices. The MPC has looked through the impact of temporary external shocks and administered prices (including changes to VAT) on the level of CPI inflation and focussed on the level of domestically generated inflation in the market sector. Money wage increases have been low and stable. But CPI inflation has been above the 2% target for a long period. Should the MPC have taken action to bring inflation down? To do that would have meant driving down wages by creating a deeper recession, even higher unemployment and lasting damage to the job prospects of many young people. I know of no-one who has argued that the problem with the UK economy is that it has not had a sufficiently deep recession. Inflation rose to over 5% but has now come down to 2.7%, and the Committee believes that it is likely to come back to the target over the next two years. In effect the MPC has allowed a longer inflation overshoot than usual in order to avoid pushing up unemployment. Our current remit does not specify how the MPC should strike a balance between growth and inflation in the short run. The horizon over which inflation should come back to target is effectively delegated to the MPC. But should the MPC itself choose how quickly to bring inflation back to target, or should the government use its annual remit to set that horizon? Is there a gain from trying to quantify how the MPC should manage the trade-off between growth and inflation in the short run? The recent guidance by the Federal Reserve about the conditions under which it would continue to hold interest rates at close to zero is a way of quantifying the �flexibility� in flexible inflation targeting. It describes how the Federal Reserve will interpret its freedom to balance its twin objectives for employment and inflation. How much discretion to give to the MPC and how much should remain with the Chancellor is an interesting question that was raised, but not fully resolved, in 1997 with the system of open letters which gives the Chancellor the opportunity to comment on the horizon over which the MPC plans to bring inflation back to target. So there are certainly aspects of the inflation targeting regime to consider. In assessing the current framework, however, there are two factors that should not be ignored. First, the primary responsibility of any central bank is to ensure stability of the price level in the long run. To drop the objective of low inflation would be to forget a lesson from our post-war history. In the 1960s, Britain stood out from much of the rest of the industrialised world in trying to target an unrealistic growth rate for the economy as a whole, while pretending that its pursuit was consistent with stable inflation. The painful experience of the 1970s showed that this illusion on the part of policy-makers came at a terrible price for working men and women in this country. The battle to bring inflation expectations down was long and hard, and involved persistently high levels of unemployment. Wishful thinking can be indulged if the costs fall on the dreamers; when the costs fall on others, it is unacceptable. So a long-run target of 2% inflation should be an essential part of our macroeconomic framework. And it is interesting to note that within the past year both the Federal Reserve    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                       5 and the Bank of Japan have adopted a target for annual inflation of 2%. The anchoring of inflation expectations has been the most successful aspect of the inflation targeting regime and it has allowed the Bank to avoid an unnecessarily damaging tightening of policy in response to short-run movements in inflation. It would be irresponsible to lose that. Second, the inflation target is not an impediment to achieving recovery today. It has not prevented the MPC from taking measures to combat the downward momentum in the economy following the shock of 2008. It is precisely because inflation expectations have so far remained firmly anchored that the MPC has been able to respond flexibly to weak demand. So the challenge we face is not the inadequacy of the framework, but the fact that there is no easy route to recovery after a major banking crisis. Recovery is inevitably slow and protracted. The healing process will take time, and patience is not a quality associated with our political debate. Patience and a sense of realism are sometimes mistaken for fatalism. Our economy is recovering, more slowly than we might wish, but we are moving in the right direction. The Bank has not been, and will not be, inactive. Low interest rates will not be withdrawn prematurely, but we should not rely solely on general stimulus to aggregate demand. If we embark on the type of programme I have outlined tonight, I believe we can roll back the black cloud of uncertainty darkening the outlook for demand, allow the rays of supply optimism to peer through, and sustain a recovery based on a successful rebalancing of the UK economy. The need to fix the banking system and introduce improvements to the future supply performance of the economy are, I know, felt even more keenly here in Northern Ireland than in Great Britain. And patience is a quality that has been demanded of you all in the Province over many years. The business community is the key to the prosperity of Northern Ireland. I wish all of you success in the challenges ahead. And I look forward to returning in a private capacity to enjoy the beauty of your Province.     6                                                                        BIS central bankers� speeches"
2013-04-17	"Mervyn King: Monetary policy � many targets, many instruments. Where do we stand? Remarks by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the IMF Conference on �Rethinking macro policy II: first steps and early lessons�, Washington DC, 16 April 2013.                                                   *    *     *  I would like to thank Charlie Bean, Alex Brazier, Spencer Dale, Andy Haldane and Iain de Weymarn for helpful comments and suggestions in preparing these remarks; and in particular Tim Taylor who I regard as a co-author, although he is absolved of any errors in the current draft.   Introduction The past five years has been an extraordinary period for central banks. The breadth and scale of our operations has expanded in ways that were previously unimaginable as we responded to a crisis in the banking sector and the wider economy. In monetary policy, we have moved into uncharted territory. But has our notion of what central banks should do, and how, changed? Now is a good time to reflect on where we stand. I want to focus my remarks on two areas. First, I want to draw out what have we learned about the objectives of monetary policy. Second, I want to reflect on the implications of the proliferation of instruments that have been used to meet those objectives.  Objectives For over thirty years the objective of central banks was clear. It was to set monetary policy to achieve long-run price stability. But the events of the past five years have raised questions about how central banks manage the trade-offs between price stability, output stability and financial stability in order to meet our overall macroeconomic objectives. Throughout the era of inflation targeting, the importance of the trade-off between output and inflation stabilisation in the short term has been well understood. Monetary policy was seen as aiming at a target for inflation in the long run, which was to be achieved by bringing inflation back to target over a suitable time horizon so as to avoid excessive volatility of real variables such as output and employment. Optimal monetary policy was seen as a choice of how best to navigate the short-run trade-off while ensuring that the long-run objective was met. Failure to deliver price stability is costly, as UK experience amply demonstrates. Chart 1 shows the variance of inflation and of the output gap in the UK, using quarterly data for two periods.1 Contrast the performance in the 35 years up to 1992 with the first 15 years of inflation targeting. Better policy can take some credit for this improvement, as the anchoring of inflation expectations led to a huge reduction in inflation volatility. It was tempting to think that we had moved onto the �Taylor frontier� � which maps feasible combinations of the smallest variances of the output gap and inflation. The Great Stability appeared to be a permanent break from earlier periods � periods when monetary policy exhibited more unpredictable behaviour and left the economy to the north-east of the Taylor frontier (Chart 2). And in one important sense it was � the dark days of double-digit inflation were consigned to the past.     1     The inflation measure used is the quarterly rate of increase of the GDP deflator, defined as the ratio of     nominal GDP to real GDP. The output gap is estimated as the difference between the log of real GDP and the     trend path of log GDP, derived using the HP-filter. Source: ONS and Bank of England calculations.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                               1 But the Great Stability was not representative of a new normal. The variance of the output gap � though not inflation � has been much higher over the past five years as the financial crisis generated a deep recession (Chart 3). So what have we learned? The banking and broader economic crisis has demonstrated that macroeconomic policy can face an additional trade-off between ensuring the soundness of the financial system in the medium term, and keeping output in line with potential output and inflation on target in the near term. Such a trade-off arises because financial vulnerabilities can build even while output is growing steadily and inflation is low and stable. Let me give three examples of the sort of underlying mechanisms at play. First, persistent misperceptions of future spending power may generate a mix of demand that proves to be unsustainable. I believe this was an important factor underlying the crisis. Although output in deficit countries � like the UK � appeared to be growing at a sustainable rate, that gave a misleading impression of the sustainability of the Great Stability. In fact the level of domestic demand was too high and the level of net exports correspondingly too weak. Second, as Hyman Minsky described, periods of stability encourage exuberance in credit markets, leading eventually to instability. And third, low short-term policy rates may encourage investors to take on more risk than they would otherwise accept as they �search for yield�. It is arguable that monetary policy paid insufficient heed to the potential impact of such financial vulnerabilities. Financial shocks are costly because their effects can be too rapid for policy easily to offset, and because they hit potential supply so creating a trade-off between output and inflation. In other words, the Taylor frontier is less favourable (further from the origin), when account is taken of financial shocks, than we might have believed. Taking the entire period of inflation targeting � including the recent past � might give a more accurate indication of where this �Minsky-Taylor� frontier lies than using data for the Great Stability period alone (Chart 4). What implications does this have for monetary policy? Possibly none � if we can rely now on macroprudential tools to ensure financial sector resilience. But set those tools to one side for a moment. Monetary policy could be used to reach a point more like P in Chart 5, with less variation in the output gap and more variation in inflation than we have actually experienced over the past 20 years. Put another way, higher interest rates in the run up to the financial crisis might have reduced the impact of the subsequent bust, at the cost of below-target inflation and below-trend output before the crisis hit.2 In practice new macroprudential tools and better micro-prudential supervision will improve the possibilities available to monetary policymakers. Having additional instruments in effect brings about a favourable shift in the Minsky-Taylor frontier (or surface) which defines the possibilities open to policymakers.3 Nevertheless, consistent with the new remit4 given to the Monetary Policy Committee by the UK Government last month, the experience of recent years suggests that there may be    2     A more detailed appraisal of this argument is contained in �Twenty years of inflation targeting�, a speech by     Mervyn King (2012), available at http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2012/606.aspx. 3     A social planner would use both instruments together to pick the welfare maximising point on the frontier /     surface, and in the UK the Monetary Policy Committee is expected to work closely with the Financial Policy     Committee which has the statutory power to deploy macro-prudential instruments. 4     The relevant passage in the Monetary Policy Committee�s remit states: �Circumstances may also arise in     which attempts to keep inflation at the inflation target could exacerbate the development of imbalances that     the Financial Policy Committee may judge to represent a potential risk to financial stability. The Financial     Policy Committee�s macro-prudential tools are the first line of defence against such risks, but in these     circumstances the Committee may wish to allow inflation to deviate from the target temporarily, consistent with     its need to have regard to the policy actions of the Financial Policy Committee. The full remit is available here:     http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/chx_letter_to_boe_monetary_policy_framework_200313.pdf.    2                                                                                            BIS central bankers� speeches circumstances in which it is justified to aim off the inflation target for a while in order to moderate the risk of financial crises.  Instruments For institutions generally regarded as conservative or even hidebound, central banks have been remarkably innovative in their creation of new instruments during the crisis. Lowering official interest rates virtually to zero was extraordinary in itself. But the wholesale redesign of frameworks to supply liquidity to the banking system, the expansion of the monetary base by multiples of its pre-crisis level through the purchase of assets held by the non-bank private sector, and the involvement of central banks in risky credit easing operations have all raised serious questions about the role of central banks � and even challenged the idea of central bank independence. Table 1 shows just how large has been the scale of central bank expansion. The monetary base has risen by unprecedented proportions as we tried to prevent a collapse of broad money and credit as happened in the US during the Great Depression and today in Greece. And central bank balance sheets have risen across the industrialised world, as shown in Table 2. That expansion has reflected both money creation through asset purchases and lending against collateral. All major central banks have created new ways to lend against collateral.5 Far from their image as conservative creatures, are central banks at risk of throwing their traditional caution to the wind and ignoring the limits on monetary policy? Two limits are relevant in current circumstances. First, no matter how much liquidity is thrown at the banking system, lending and the economy will not recover if the banking system is inadequately capitalised and suffering from excessive leverage. That is why the Bank of England�s Financial Policy Committee has placed weight on the need for the weaker UK banks to raise capital. It is not surprising that the more strongly capitalised banks in the UK are expanding lending and the poorly capitalised banks are contracting lending. Second, there are limits on the ability of domestic monetary policy to expand real demand in the face of the need for changes in the real equilibrium of the economy. I do not believe that the present problems in the United Kingdom stem only from a large negative shock to aggregate demand. In common with many other countries, our problems also reflect the underlying need to rebalance our economy, requiring a reallocation of resources both within and between nations. It is not simply a question of boosting aggregate demand, but of helping to bring about a shift to a new equilibrium. That in turn implies the need for both large changes in relative prices, especially between tradable and non-tradable goods and services, and a shift in the relative levels of domestic demand at home and overseas. There are, therefore, limits on what any one country�s domestic monetary policies can achieve without the support of others. Despite these limits, circumstances have demanded that central banks take extraordinary measures. Such measures can risk moving into territory more normally associated with fiscal policy and, in doing so, put at risk their hard-won independence. There are, it seems to me, three threats to central bank independence. First, there is the risk of appearing to promise too much or allowing too much to be expected of us. With constraints on other policy instruments, central banks are seen as �the only game    5     Facilities introduced by the Bank of England have included the Discount Window Facility, the Special Liquidity     Scheme, Extended Collateral Term Repos, Extended Collateral Long Term Repos, and the Funding for     Lending Scheme. The ECB initiated its Long Term Repo Operations. And Federal Reserve facilities include     the Term Auction Facility, the Term Assert Backed Securities Loan Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility,     the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Term Securities Lending Facility, the ABCP Money Market Fund     Liquidity Facility, the Money Market Investing Funding Facility, and the Term Discount Window Program.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                    3 in town�. But failure to make clear the limits to monetary policy risks disillusionment with central banks and the inevitable political pressure on them that would follow. Second, at the zero lower bound there is no clear distinction between monetary and fiscal policy. But it is still important to ensure that central banks do not take on to their balance sheets risks to the taxpayer that are properly matters that should be decided by elected politicians. To ensure price stability in the long run it is vital to maintain the operational independence of a central bank. Any decisions that put taxpayers� money at risk must be made by finance ministries, and central banks must protect their balance sheets by imposing appropriate haircuts on collateral, and avoiding the purchase of risky private-sector assets. Third, and important even when we move away from the zero lower bound, the expansion of central bank responsibilities to include macroprudential policy and, in the case of the Bank of England, responsibility for regulating the banking system, has made independence much harder to define. The deployment of responsibilities outside monetary policy cannot be divorced from the government in the same way as is possible for monetary policy. For example, in the area of financial stability and banking supervision, there will be times when public funds may be put at risk when rescuing or resolving a failing institution � and that decision is properly one for the finance ministry. It is far from straightforward for a central bank governor to be completely independent in terms of monetary policy, somewhat independent in terms of financial stability, and not at all independent in terms of operations that risk taxpayers� money. The financial crisis has challenged our understanding of the objectives of monetary policy and exposed its limits. And, through the proliferation of instruments and resulting increase in responsibilities, it has complicated the question of central bank independence. So how should we respond to this more complex environment? We must keep sight of three important principles. First, although they should be realistic about what can be achieved, it is right that elected politicians and parliaments decide on the objectives of policy. Second, as we learned in the 1970s, if the central bank is to achieve price stability � its fundamental role � it must be sufficiently independent. And third, in order to protect that independence, its limits should be very clearly circumscribed, and we should be exceptionally careful with decisions that put public funds at risk. The challenge remains, as it was twenty years ago, to make �constrained discretion� work in practice.

2013-06-21	Mervyn King: A Governor looks back � and forward Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Lord Mayor�s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London, London, 19 June 2013.                                            *    *   *  My Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen: Chancellor: thank you for those generous words. It has been a privilege to work with you over the past three years, a period of great change both at home and abroad. Your support for the Bank has been much appreciated at this end of town, and you have changed for the better the regulatory framework that oversees the City. But we both know that the past few years would have been much more difficult without the continual support of two people. And I am so pleased that both Frances and Barbara are with us tonight. And I�m particularly happy, George, that neither you nor I have to speak after either of them because experience suggests that we would suffer from the comparison. Lord Mayor: let me thank you too for presiding over my final Mansion House Dinner. We have enjoyed many musical evenings together, and Barbara and I look forward to sharing many more with you and Clare after you shed the chains of office later this year. The City has been extremely fortunate to benefit from your energy, drive and can-do attitude as Lord Mayor. I shall not detain you this evening with a retrospective examination of my time as Governor. Suffice it to say that it was a game of two halves. And, far from a boring goalless draw, it turned out to be a rather exciting and dramatic game, full of incident, with a red card or two and a passionate and at times justifiably angry crowd. We shall have to wait for the historians of tomorrow to file the full match report. Instead, tonight I want to focus on the twin challenges of engineering a recovery and reforming the financial system. I want to look back on the huge amount that has been done, and look forward to the unfinished business on both fronts, much of it for the Bank of England. I shall also tell you a story about the Governor of the Bank of England, the Governor of the Bank of Canada and a certain Mr Osborne. But that comes later. Since 2008, the Bank�s Monetary Policy Committee has gone to extraordinary lengths to stabilise the economy and support growth and employment. In fact, we have pursued what I have called the �paradox of policy�: doing in the short run, by encouraging spending through an unprecedentedly loose monetary policy, the opposite of what we need to do in the long run, which is to raise national saving. But that has been necessary to prevent an even worse recession, and without similar action from other central banks the world might have experienced a major depression. Now there are clear signs that a recovery in the UK, albeit modest, is underway. From the beginning of this year, business surveys have improved, broad money growth has stabilised at around 5% a year, and the housing market is picking up. Despite this encouraging picture, growth is not yet strong enough to reduce the considerable margin of spare capacity in the economy. Nor is recovery at an adequate rate fully assured. The weakness of the euro area and the problems of the UK banking system continue to act as a drag on growth. So the need to support the recovery remains. Of course we must be mindful of the risks from injecting more money into the economy. We cannot afford to return to the inflationary episodes of the past. In the two decades before inflation targeting was introduced in 1992, inflation averaged almost 10% a year. The purpose of inflation targeting was to change the way in which interest rate decisions were made and to build credibility in the UK�s commitment to price stability. Over the following two decades, CPI inflation averaged only a fraction above 2%. Today, inflation is above the 2% target � as it has been for most of the past five years. But our economy has had to absorb an   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                 1 oil price shock on a par with that of the 1970s, as well as a sharp depreciation of sterling. And yet there are few signs of domestically generated inflation, which has remained close to 2%.1 Pay rises and underlying inflationary pressure are low, and the medium-term outlook is for inflation to fall back to the target. Inflation targeting achieved its objective. The greater risk at present is that, over the next few years, unemployment remains unnecessarily high. We must not forget that one million more people are out of work than in the five years before the crisis. It is too soon to say the job of securing recovery is complete. There is a powerful case for more stimulus in the short run. The present extraordinary monetary policies cannot, however, continue indefinitely. Both nominal and real interest rates are at unsustainably low levels. There is an understandable yearning for a return to normality. And in recent weeks bond yields have risen � up around 45 basis points since the start of May. But such market moves should not be confused with a return to normality. A rapid return to higher interest rates would do great damage to the balance sheets of highly indebted households, companies and, especially, financial institutions. The challenge in returning to normality is not so much managing market expectations when that eventually happens, important though that is, but in creating the economic conditions in which it is sensible to return to more normal levels of interest rates. The real challenge � on a global scale � is to rebalance the world economy so that very low interest rates are not required to exhort deficit countries to spend in order to absorb the surpluses elsewhere. Monetary policy cannot provide the answer. It can only buy time to bring about the necessary structural changes in investment, trade and capital flows. Whether they involve changes in currency values or restructuring of debt is a political choice, but a failure to deal with global imbalances will not only retard the recovery in the world as a whole, but worsen the scale of the adjustment ultimately needed. It will inevitably be a bumpy ride. The other obstacle to a return to normality is our banking system where, despite the generous provision of liquidity and funding from the State, lending remains lacklustre, and risk premia high. Although the combined balance sheet of our largest banks has shrunk since the height of the crisis in 2008, it is still 400% of annual GDP. Leverage ratios have fallen, but all our major banks remain highly leveraged. And of course the two biggest lenders to the domestic economy remain largely in state ownership. It is difficult to imagine a banking sector like that making a real contribution to any economic recovery. It must be time for decisive action. Chancellor, you have made clear tonight that you embrace that view. Britain needs a thriving banking system to serve households and businesses, and Lloyds and RBS will be able to play that role to the full only when back in the private sector. I welcome your announcement that Lloyds Banking Group will be returned to private hands soon. And I very much support your plans for a full review of the future structure of RBS. The return of banking supervision to the Bank of England has also seen decisive actions. The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) and the new Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have acted quickly to make our banking system more resilient. In March, the FPC recommended that banks� capital should be assessed using more prudent estimates of expected losses and risk weights. Since April, the Board of the PRA has been making those assessments and asking banks to take action to deal with any shortfall of capital. That work is now complete, the banks know the results, and tomorrow we will publish them for each of the major banks. In total, the eight largest banks have a capital shortfall of around �25bn relative to the standard recommended by the FPC. After this exercise, our major banks all now have plans for actions to fill that shortfall. The first evidence is the announcement on   1     As measured by the rate of increase in the GDP deflator.    2                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches Monday by the Co-operative Bank. Others will follow. By taking firm pre-emptive action, we have shown what the new judgement-led approach to supervision means in practice. It substitutes substance for process and judgement for box-ticking. We need not more but better regulation and, just as with monetary policy, we have changed the way regulatory decisions are made. The PRA announcement tomorrow is another step in dealing with the legacy of the past. It will make our banking system more resilient and better able to support recovery. But it is too soon to say that the job is done. Many of our major lenders will still be highly levered. The levels of capital required by the Vickers reforms, on the one hand, and the Basel standards for large international banks, on the other, mean that there is clearly some way to go before we can claim to have a really well-capitalised banking system. In future, the FPC and the PRA will work together to conduct regular stress tests of our banks, starting in 2014. Those stress tests will I am sure be made public, and banks will be expected to set out their plans for making up any identified shortfall in capital. Managing this process, and the transition to a higher level of capital, will be key tasks for the FPC and PRA in the coming years. Those who argue that requiring higher levels of capital will necessarily restrict lending are wrong. The reverse is true. It is insufficient capital that restricts lending. That is why some of our weaker banks are shrinking their balance sheets. Capital supports lending and provides resilience. And, without a resilient banking system, it will be difficult to sustain a recovery. Although higher capital does not restrict lending, requirements to hold more liquid assets do. Every pound of additional holdings of liquid assets is a pound that could otherwise be lent to the real economy. That is why the Bank has stood ready, through the Special Liquidity Scheme, its new Discount Window Facility, through its market operations (including the ECTR) and through its Funding for Lending Scheme, to provide a backstop for the liquidity needs of the banking system � against adequate collateral and at an appropriate interest rate. Given that backstop, the FPC has over the past year been recommending that regulatory requirements to hold liquid assets should be loosened. The Bank�s provision of liquidity to the banking system has been transformed out of all recognition in the past six years. But here too there is unfinished business. We asked Bill Winters to review our system and make recommendations for further changes. We have reviewed his proposals and will soon be taking steps to expand our regular auctions to a wider pool of collateral and to make our Discount Window Facility both cheaper and more easily accessible. All these policy actions have and will put our economy in position for a recovery. But we must also ensure that our financial system is truly reformed in a way that reflects the lessons of the financial crisis. At this Dinner six years ago, before the crisis began, I said, �Excessive leverage is the common theme of many financial crises of the past. Are we really so much cleverer than the financiers of the past?� We are all much wiser now. And this country can claim to have been in the vanguard in learning lessons. Much has been done. But we cannot be complacent. As the memories of the crisis fade, and those who saw it at first hand retire, it is vital that the �audacity of pessimism� is not lost. We must deal once and for all with the problem of financial institutions that are too big, or too important, to fail. Some progress has been made. When the crisis hit, we in the UK had neither an effective deposit insurance scheme nor a resolution framework to deal with failing banks. Now we have both. But there is unfinished business. Although the UK is leading the way in the development of agreements among regulators worldwide as to how the largest banks could be resolved, managing cross-border resolutions is still fraught with difficulty. We also need to implement the proposals of the Independent Commission on Banking as soon as possible, including the �ring-fence� to separate commercial from investment banking, and the leverage ratio. A situation in which taxpayers again bear the burden when banks fail is   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                    3 unacceptable. That implicit guarantee is costly and distorts competition. The United Kingdom simply cannot afford to have an international banking centre if taxpayers have to underwrite a balance sheet that is many multiples of GDP. Too important to fail is too important to ignore. The economics of banking is changing, and the City has an opportunity to adapt and lead the new forms of banking that will emerge. The strength of the City of London has always been based on two qualities: its ability to adapt to new circumstances, and its truly global perspective. That will stand us in good stead now. But the future of banking will depend not only on changes to leverage but also on a greater degree of responsibility by all involved: the leaders of our banks, regulators and consumers. We must restore trust in our banking system. Today�s substantial and authoritative Report from the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards is an important landmark in mapping the path to that goal. Changing the ethics and culture of banking is a precondition of restoring trust. As the Commission�s Report shows, the sheer size and complexity of global banks have led to failures of governance. Governments, regulators, prosecutors and non-executive directors have all struggled to come to terms with firms that pose a risk to taxpayers, cannot be prosecuted because of their systemic importance, and are difficult to manage because of their size and complexity. It is not in our national interest to have banks that are too big to fail, too big to jail, or simply too big. Solving these problems is the work of a generation, and I hope that the financial community will rise to this challenge and not shrink from it. The City as a whole does merit trust. And, when the historians look back on this period many years from now, they will conclude that although we were not wiser than the financiers of the past, we did learn and we reformed, and the country benefitted and prospered as a result. As I leave the scene, there is undoubtedly much unfinished business for my successor. I am delighted that Mark Carney will be the next Governor. He brings a new generation of leadership to the Bank, as well as enormous experience from his time as a central bank governor and his role in steering the Financial Stability Board. He has my wholehearted best wishes for his term as Governor. Mark is, however, not the first Canadian to have been in the frame for the Governorship of the Bank of England. The very first Governor of the Bank of Canada, Graham Towers, was put forward by Keynes as a successor to Montagu Norman. The proposed transfer fell through � apparently the Directors of the Bank viewed the Canadian as �too Keynesian�. What that tells us about his views on monetary activism I do not know. But it is perhaps worth noting that Towers� first Deputy Governor was a Mr. Osborne, who agreed to move to Canada from the Bank of England for a spell of �up to 5 years�. Sadly, the partnership between the Canadian Governor and Mr. Osborne lasted only three years, before the latter departed. But, Chancellor, remember that history doesn�t always repeat itself. In Britain, and especially in the City, we have always welcomed talent from around the world in academic, business, artistic and sporting life. Why should central banking be different? George, you are to be congratulated on Mark�s appointment. I shall of course be sad to leave. But Governors come and Governors go � it is institutions, and the ideas they embody, that matter more. I leave behind a strong, independent, much- changed Bank now focused on its two main responsibilities. The lessons of recent years have been learnt and it is up to us all to remember them. The test of our monetary arrangements is to see them work successfully under new leadership, none of whom were present at the creation. No doubt some things will change. No doubt some things need to change. After all one does not change an institution in order to set it in concrete. A successful institution, just like the City as a whole, always adapts to new circumstances. I know the Bank will continue to do just that under Mark�s leadership. Mark inherits a wealth of young talent in the Bank, led by three outstanding Deputy Governors: Charlie Bean, Andrew    4                                                                             BIS central bankers� speeches Bailey and, of course, Paul Tucker, who has made an enormous contribution to the Bank over three decades. The Bank of England is in safe hands, and the country will be the better for it. Lord Mayor, the wheel may have come off your carriage at last year�s installation, but then we saw your characteristic ability to turn every situation to advantage as you returned in triumph to Mansion House in a Land Rover. As the City too faces the challenge of turning disaster into triumph, it would do well to follow your example of how to �treat those two imposters just the same�. Roger, your commitment to the promotion of the creative industries � crucial to this, the most exciting city in the world � as well as opportunities for children, aspiring musicians, even trees and bicycles, is well known. And all of us here tonight would like to pay tribute to you Lord Mayor, and to thank the Lady Mayoress, Clare, and yourself, Roger, for the splendid hospitality which you�ve extended to us all this evening. So I invite you all to rise and join me in the traditional toast of good health and prosperity to �The Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress, Roger and Clare Gifford�.

2013-07-25	"Mark Carney: Jane Austen to feature on Bank of England banknotes Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at Jane Austen�s House Museum, Chawton, 24 July 2013.                                            *    *    *  Good afternoon, and welcome to Chawton, home in her final eight years to Jane Austen and her family. This cottage occupied a special place in Jane Austen�s life, as a return to the countryside brought contentment after an unhappy spell in Bath. All six of Jane Austen�s best known novels were published after she moved to Chawton, and three of them were written in their entirety here. It therefore gives me great pleasure to be here today to announce that Jane Austen will be the next character to appear on the Bank of England�s �10 note, replacing Charles Darwin. Jane Austen will become the 17th historical figure to feature on our banknotes. She merits her place in this select group as one of the greatest writers in English literature. Her novels have an enduring, timeless and universal appeal � they have never been out of print since first being published, have inspired numerous modern adaptations and are loved by people around the world. Austen�s combination of sharp wit, engaging narrative, knowing satire and social commentary has ensured her place among the country�s favourite authors. I am delighted now to unveil the image for the new Jane Austen note. It features a portrait adapted in the late 19th century from an original sketch by Jane�s sister and closest friend Cassandra, together with the quote �I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!� from Pride and Prejudice. Our intention is that the Austen note will be introduced within a year of the recently announced Churchill �5 note, so that the new note could come into circulation as early as 2017. I am certain she will prove to be a popular choice. This will not, however, be the first time that the Austen name has appeared on a banknote. Jane�s brother Henry set himself up as a banker with interests here in Hampshire as well as in London. At that time many banks were small and local, and could issue their own banknotes. The British Museum in fact holds a �10 note from Henry Austen�s bank in Alton, just a couple of miles from here, listing on the note the names of the partners in the bank: Austen, Gray and Vincent. Unfortunately, while Jane Austen wrote in an early work that �when a man has once got his name in a banking house he rolls in money�, that turned out not to be the case for her brother Henry. Banking was for a time profitable, but unwise lending led to the collapse of Alton bank, followed by the collapse of Henry�s London bank and his bankruptcy in 1816. Depositors in these banks, including Jane Austen herself, were left out of pocket. While there is a familiar ring to parts of this sorry tale, you can be comforted that our job at the Bank of England is to protect the value of the new Jane Austen note. In fact, maintaining confidence in our currency is the fundamental responsibility of your central bank. That extends to maintaining its value, protecting against counterfeiting, and also ensuring that the choice of character on the notes commands respect and legitimacy. The Bank of England has, through its banknotes, a unique and rare opportunity to promote awareness of Britain�s history and to acknowledge the life and work of its greatest citizens. After the announcement of the Churchill note concerns were expressed that � in the absence of any other changes to the Bank of England�s notes � none of the four characters on our notes would be a woman. That was not the Bank�s intention; we have listened and we fully understand the concerns raised by many people, including some whom I am delighted to see here today. We believe that our notes should celebrate the full diversity of great British historical figures and their contributions in a wide range of fields. The Bank is committed to that objective, and we want people to have confidence in our commitment to diversity. That is why I am today announcing a review of the selection process for future banknote characters.   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  1 There are two objectives: first, to review the principles and refine the criteria that guide the choice of historical characters for banknotes; and second, to establish a process to ensure that potential candidates are consistently and transparently judged against those criteria. The review will be led by Chris Salmon, the Bank�s Chief Cashier, who will be meeting with interested parties as well as inviting feedback from members of the public via our website. The conclusions will be announced by the end of the year. Now let me introduce a real expert to tell you a bit more about Jane Austen and her time at Chawton. Elizabeth Proudman is Chairman of the Jane Austen Society, and I would like to thank her, along with Ann Channon and staff here at Jane Austen�s House Museum, for hosting today�s event. Elizabeth, over to you.     2                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches"
2013-08-29	"Mark Carney: Crossing the threshold to recovery Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at a business lunch hosted by the CBI East Midlands, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Chamber of Commerce and the Institute of Directors, Nottingham, 28 August 2013.                                            *    *   *  Introduction I�m delighted to be in the East Midlands today to deliver my first speech as Governor of the Bank of England. With leaders in retail, manufacturing, engineering, logistics, information services, biosciences and education, Nottingham and the East Midlands are integral to the success of the UK economy. The businesses here will make good on the promise of recovery in our economy. So I�m very pleased to have the opportunity to listen to business people in this region. In my years in central banking, I have found that there is no substitute for hearing directly from those who deliver economic growth. What I hear from businesses here and elsewhere is that a renewed recovery is taking hold amid a rising tide of optimism. The signs are that this recovery is broad based and set to continue. This is welcome and should be encouraged. Over the past five years, a pervasive sense of uncertainty has held the economy back. The British people have been through the virtual collapse of the financial system, the worst recession in living memory, large job losses, falls in real wages and a, at times harrowing, crisis in the euro area, our most important trading partner. Households have been worried about their savings, jobs, earning power and their homes; companies have been concerned about the availability of credit, the health of their suppliers, the viability of their markets and the prospects for their investments. Uncertainty has reduced confidence, dampened spending, and slowed growth. As a result the UK has endured its weakest recovery on record. Comparisons with other countries throw that fact into sharper relief. Over the past five years Germany has grown by 2%, the US by 5%, Australia by 13% and China by more than 50%. Meanwhile the UK economy still produces 3% less than it did five years ago. The real cost of this poor performance is that around a million more people are unemployed than before the recession. Capacity has lain idle in firms and opportunities have gone wanting for lack of finance and confidence. It will take a period of robust growth to begin to reduce meaningfully this spare capacity in the labour market and in companies. The Bank of England�s task now is to secure the fledgling recovery, to allow it to develop into a period of sustained and robust growth. We aim to get there in part by reducing the uncertainty that has held back growth. And we are using our full suite of policy tools to help rebuild confidence so that we all can move forward in a sustainable manner. First, we are giving confidence that interest rates won�t go up until jobs, incomes and spending are recovering at a sustainable pace. In particular, we will have to see the rate of unemployment, currently 7.8%, fall at least to a threshold of 7% before even beginning to consider whether to raise Bank Rate. Second, we are building confidence in banks so they can serve the needs of the real economy by providing credit to those who can put it to work. In particular, we have required banks to repair their balance sheets so that their capital ratios at least reach a threshold of 7% by the turn of the year. Crossing these two 7% thresholds is necessary to ensure that our economy can withstand the inevitable bumps along the road to full recovery.   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                 1 We must meet the thresholds in a disciplined way. We will ensure that we bring inflation down as the recovery progresses. And we will use our considerable policy tools to prevent new vulnerabilities, whether in the housing sector or financial sector, from arising during this critical transition period. Today I want to say more about how the Bank will help bring the British economy over the threshold into a sustainable recovery and what that means for you.  Guidance about monetary policy Three weeks ago the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) did something it has never done before: we gave clear, quantitative guidance about the future path of monetary policy. Specifically, we announced that we do not intend to raise Bank Rate at least until the unemployment rate falls to 7%, provided there are no material threats to either price or financial stability.1 All nine MPC members agreed to set monetary policy in future according to this framework of forward guidance. That does not mean Bank Rate will automatically rise when unemployment falls to 7%. Nor is 7% a target for the unemployment rate � it should ultimately fall well below that level. Before the Great Recession, the UK�s unemployment rate stood at just over 5%. The 7% threshold is instead a staging post along the road to recovery. When unemployment reaches 7% the MPC will reassess the state of the economy and the appropriate stance of monetary policy. Our forward guidance provides you with certainty that interest rates will not rise too soon. Exactly how long they stay low will depend on the progress of the recovery and in particular how quickly unemployment comes down. What matters is that rates won�t go up until jobs and incomes are really growing. The knowledge that interest rates will stay low until the recovery is well established should give greater confidence to households to spend responsibly and businesses to invest wisely. It may seem that unemployment doesn�t have far to fall, from the current 7.8% to the 7% threshold. The MPC�s central view, though, is that this could take some time � for three reasons. First, while the outlook for growth has improved considerably in recent months, growth prospects over the next three years are solid not stellar. The MPC�s current forecast is for growth to average around 2�% per year over the next three years, just below its historical average rate of 2�%. That suggests spare capacity will be used up only gradually. Second, a great many jobs need to be created to bring unemployment down. A fall in unemployment from its current level to 7% over three years would mean well over three quarters of a million new jobs created � and given the shrinkage in the public sector, over a million new jobs in the private sector. Third, a recovery in growth does not necessarily mean faster job creation and lower unemployment. More than half of the increase in employment since the recession has been in part-time jobs. Many part-timers would prefer to work full time. If the recovery were fuelled by involuntary part-time jobs becoming full time, nearly half a million fewer new jobs would be created.2    1     Until the unemployment threshold is reached, the MPC also intends not to reduce the stock of asset     purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves and, consistent with that, intends to reinvest the     cashflows associated with all maturing gilts held in the Asset Purchase Facility. 2     1.4 million part-time workers would prefer to be working full time, three quarters of a million more than before     the financial crisis. If those additional involuntary part-time workers switched to full time working, the extra     hours worked would be equivalent to over 400,000 new jobs.    2                                                                                          BIS central bankers� speeches Moreover, there is certainly scope for the economy to grow through an increase in output per hour worked rather than new job creation. Productivity growth has been anaemic and � remarkably � the UK is no more productive than it was back in 2005 � before Jake Bugg got his first guitar. The critical questions are how much and how quickly productivity improves. The MPC�s central view is that productivity growth is likely to pick up only slowly in the early phase of recovery, but that there is potential for growth to accelerate as the recovery takes hold. The slow pickup in productivity means unemployment could initially fall quite rapidly, but fall short of 7%. Over the next three years productivity is expected to grow at around 1.8% per year, below its pre-crisis trend3 of 2.2%. While even that modest productivity recovery is not assured, it is hardly an aggressive forecast. It implies that productivity reaches its 2008 level only in 2015. And it means that productivity doesn�t catch up any of its current 15% shortfall relative to its pre-crisis trend. Were any productivity catch-up to happen, unemployment could take even longer than three years to reach the threshold. A rebound in productivity, if accompanied by higher output growth, would be no bad thing. It would boost the incomes of those in employment and is an essential part of improving the UK�s competitiveness. Moreover, in such a scenario, you would know to expect interest rates to stay lower for longer, encouraging household spending and business investment. Our forward guidance is a stabiliser � securing the scale and duration of recovery that is needed to bring unemployment down. The prospect that interest rates might stay at their low level for longer will not be welcome for savers. I have tremendous sympathy for them � after all they have done the right thing, set money aside, and now they are earning returns that are substantially below what they would have expected. But raising interest rates now is not the answer � instead what savers need is a stronger economy. That will mean higher asset prices, and will allow interest rates to return to normal levels in a sustainable way. A strong economy is in all of our interests, as it will deliver better job prospects for our friends, neighbours, children and grandchildren. The last thing savers want is for the UK to follow Japan by raising interest rates before recovery is secured, only to find that we are condemned to decades more of low interest rates and lost opportunities.  Our forward guidance is about setting the path of inflation to return to target Let me reassure you that our mandate to deliver price stability has not changed. Our inflation target of 2% was reconfirmed in our remit from the Chancellor in March. The MPC�s guidance is fully consistent with price stability. I can also assure you of my personal commitment to price stability. I certainly have no hesitation in raising interest rates when required � when I was Governor of the Bank of Canada, we raised interest rates as the recovery there gathered pace. But that was the appropriate policy for Canada at that time. The challenges in the UK today are different, and policy must be tailored accordingly. The Bank of England�s remit recognises that, at times, it is appropriate to bring inflation back to target more slowly in order to avoid unnecessary volatility in output. With a depressed level of output and inflation above target due to temporary factors rather than demand     3     The trend is adjusted for the secular decline in North Sea oil and gas production.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  3 pressures, this is such a time. The MPC is charting the right path back to its 2% inflation target. CPI inflation is currently being pushed up by rises in utility prices and tuition fees that do not reflect the underlying pressure of demand on supply, along with the effect of past increases in import prices. Underlying domestic inflationary pressure is subdued, with wages growing at only around 1% per year. Although there will be bumps in the road, inflation is set to fall back over the next two years. In these circumstances it would not make sense to choke off the recovery by raising interest rates prematurely. Given that �administered and regulated� price increases will continue to push up on inflation over the next two years, the MPC is prepared to bring inflation back to the target over two years or a little longer. Rest assured, however, that we will bring inflation back to target � and at each point we will ensure that risks to price stability are contained. Our forward guidance builds in important safeguards of price stability. If there are any signs of underlying inflation pressures building such that it seems inflation 18�24 months ahead will be 2.5% or more, or if medium term inflation expectations are no longer sufficiently well anchored, then the guidance on interest rates no longer applies. These safeguards give ample flexibility to bring inflation back to target at the appropriate pace, while ensuring that risks to price stability are contained.  Market reaction to forward guidance Much has been made of the upward movements in market interest rates since our announcement of forward guidance. Let me give you my perspective. There has been a generalised upward move in long-term yields in advanced economies, including the UK, over the past month. The main common driver is speculation that the US Federal Reserve will soon reduce the pace of its asset purchases. That has � not surprisingly � affected yields in other countries because safe, liquid sovereign bonds of the world�s largest economies are close substitutes for each other. In the UK, these movements have been reinforced by growing expectations of recovery. As we explained at the time of the forward guidance announcement, a rise in the yields on long term bonds is consistent with our commitment to price stability and supporting the recovery. Market interest rates at terms of 2�5 years have also risen recently. The date at which the markets expect the first increase in Bank Rate has moved in from the end of 2015 to mid- 2015. One possible explanation is that markets think that unemployment will come down to 7% more quickly than we do. Since the aim of our policy is to secure recovery as quickly as possible, that would be welcome. But policy is built not on hope, but on expectation. And we estimate there is only a 1 in 3 chance of unemployment coming down that quickly (Chart 1).4 Furthermore, thinking unemployment will come down faster than we expect isn�t enough to believe interest rates will rise soon. As I said earlier, the 7% threshold is a staging post to assess the economy. Nobody should assume that it is a trigger for raising rates. Another possible explanation is that the increase in shorter-term yields, like the move in long yields, reflects changing expectations of US monetary policy. But the US recovery is much further advanced than that in the UK. While much has been made of the special relationship between the US and UK, it is not so special that the possibility of a reduction in the pace of additional stimulus in the US warrants a current reduction in the degree of monetary stimulus in the UK.   4     We are not alone in that belief � other major independent forecasters such as the OBR and NIESR share our     view that unemployment will be above 7% in 3 years� time. The MPC�s assessment of the outlook for     unemployment and likelihood of hitting the threshold is described in the August Inflation Report, available on     the Bank�s website at http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/inflationreport/2013/ir1303.aspx.    4                                                                                         BIS central bankers� speeches Movements in longer-term market interest rates are certainly relevant, but what matters most to you is what actually happens to Bank Rate, now and in the future. That is because the interest rates on 70% of loans to households and more than 50% of loans to businesses are linked to Bank Rate.5 And it is the Bank of England that controls that rate. We do not intend even to consider raising it before unemployment falls to 7%. When it does reach that point, we will control whether a rise is warranted, taking into account the strength of the recovery and the outlook for inflation. The upward move in market expectations of where Bank Rate will head in future could, at the margin, feed into the effective financial conditions facing the real economy. The MPC will be watching those conditions closely. If they tighten, and the recovery seems to be falling short of the strong growth we need, we will consider carefully whether, and how best, to stimulate the recovery further. Our forward guidance was clear that, although we would not reduce the stimulus until the recovery is secure, we would if necessary provide more.  Crossing the threshold to a healthy banking system Confidence that interest rates will stay low is a necessary step to securing the recovery, but it is not sufficient. The UK also needs a fit and healthy financial sector. It plays a vital role in generating services output in the UK, creating jobs and in exporting to the rest of the world. To serve the needs of the wider economy by extending credit to where it is needed, banks must command the confidence of their customers and investors. That is why a second element of the Bank of England�s strategy is to ensure that banks reach a clear threshold of good health. Some argue that the repair of banks� balance sheets holds back economic recovery because it causes banks to cut back their lending. The reality is the opposite: where capital has been rebuilt and balance sheets repaired, banking systems and economies have prospered. US banks have added more to their capital base since the crisis and, as a result, have been able to provide more credit to their economy than UK banks have to ours. In the past two years, UK banks have reduced their lending to the real economy by 1%. In those same two years, US banks have increased their lending by more than 8% (Chart 2). Within Europe, the correlation between the market�s assessment of a bank�s capital base at the end of 2011 and that bank�s lending over the subsequent year is striking (Chart 3). Without an adequate capital base, banks will be wary of lending and, if they do, will find themselves needing to turn off the lending taps when the unexpected happens, as it inevitably does. Investors will lack the confidence to fund banks cheaply, raising the cost of credit to the real economy, and most importantly, you will lack the confidence that credit will be available if you need it. That is why the Bank of England has established a threshold for the capital base of the major banks and building societies after taking account of likely future losses, fines for past misconduct and prudent calculations of risk. That threshold, a capital base of 7% of their risk- weighted assets and at least 3% of their total assets, must be crossed if the system is to be able to support and sustain the recovery. Some of the UK�s major banks had already crossed it, and over the summer we have made sure that the others put in place plans to reach it. The plans do not involve cutting back lending to the real economy.     5     53% of the stock of bank loans to non-financial businesses pay a floating interest rate, and for an additional     one third the interest rate is fixed for one year or less.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                   5 As a result of the Bank of England�s actions, we can relax other requirements to help with the flow of credit. Balance sheet repair will give confidence to depositors and investors who provide funding to banks. With that market funding assured, banks can safely hold fewer liquid assets, such as government bonds, that act as a cushion to be sold in the event that investors withdraw their funding. Accordingly, I can confirm today that, for major banks and building societies meeting the minimum 7% capital threshold, the Bank of England will reduce the level of required liquid asset holdings. The effect will be to lower total required holdings by �90 billion, once all eight major banks and building societies meet the capital threshold.6 That will help to underpin the supply of credit, since every pound currently held in liquid assets is a pound that could be lent to the real economy. Taken together, our actions create not just a more resilient system, but also one more able to support and sustain a recovery by serving the real economy. Crossing the threshold of balance sheet repair is not the end-point. The 7% capital threshold, like the 7% unemployment threshold, is only a staging post at which we assess our next steps. Beyond that our major banks will need to strengthen their capital base further. For example, large international banks will be subject to new internationally-agreed requirements for systemically-important firms. Other UK-focussed retail banks will need to meet the requirements set by the Vickers commission for �ringfenced� banks. Our task will be to manage the transition from the threshold to the end point in a gradual way that supports continued confidence in growth.  Using all the Bank of England�s tools to secure a sustainable recovery A recovering banking sector, coupled with persistently low interest rates and new government programmes, may lead to concern that the seeds are being sown for a new cycle in the housing market. The number of mortgage approvals for house purchase is up by 20% on a year ago, while house prices have risen by 5% over the same period � and by more than that in some parts of the country. That must be kept in perspective, however. Mortgage approvals are currently running at only a little more than half, and transactions a little more than two-thirds, of pre-crisis levels. Households� debt servicing costs relative to income are below their 20-year average, and houses cost the same relative to earnings as they did in 2003. Nevertheless, the Bank of England is acutely aware of the risk of unsustainable credit and house price growth and will be monitoring it closely. The important thing to recognise is that we now have tools other than interest rates that can be used to contain risks in the property and financial sectors. These so-called macroprudential tools were not available to us before the crisis and we are now fully prepared to deploy them if that were needed. The Bank of England is now in a position, for example, to supervise lending to specific sectors more intensively, to make recommendations to banks and building societies to restrict the terms on which new credit is provided, or even to raise capital requirements on mortgage or other types of lending.     6     In June 2013 the Financial Policy Committee concluded that there was scope for banks to reduce their     holdings of liquid assets in the near term, and recommended a relaxation in liquidity requirements in order to     strike the appropriate balance between achieving resilience and reducing possible impediments to the supply     of credit to the economy. That relaxation was subject both to banks meeting the minimum capital threshold,     and to additional firm-specific considerations. Today the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) has agreed     with that recommendation, and is announcing how it will be implemented. The PRA will be making a more     detailed statement today and writing to individual firms in due course.    6                                                                                         BIS central bankers� speeches Having these in our toolkit � and if necessary using them � will help us to keep interest rates low to secure recovery without creating risks that make that recovery ultimately unsustainable. If that is not enough, a final safeguard is built into our new forward guidance framework. The Bank�s independent Financial Policy Committee has the task of warning publicly if persistently low interest rates are leading to vulnerabilities that cannot be contained by other means. In short, we are providing the stimulus the economy needs, but in a disciplined way to secure price and financial stability.  Conclusion Let me finish by drawing the pieces of the jigsaw together. Developments at home and abroad suggest that conditions are in place for growth to be sustained into the medium-term � though at a pace that is likely to be measured rather than rapid. Households have reduced their debt levels and are now spending out of income. The outlook for the world economy and our major export markets is a bit better. The extreme risks in the euro area have been substantially reduced. The global financial system is being repaired. There will still be bumps in the road ahead. A few can be foreseen, others will surprise. Emerging market economies � the engine of global growth in recent years � are under strain as capital flows back to recovering advanced economies. A few less well-managed financial institutions still have a long journey ahead to rebuild their balance sheets and are vulnerable to shocks until they do so. Progress in Europe will remain uneven. We cannot control all these events. Instead we are focussed on doing what we can to reduce uncertainty and build resilience so that the recovery can be sustained despite the inevitable shocks ahead. We are removing uncertainty with our guidance that interest rates will stay low at least until unemployment has fallen. That will boost demand. By repairing the balance sheets of banks we are putting them in a position to support the real economy. That will promote investment. And by standing ready to use the range of other tools at our disposal, we can help to avoid sowing the seeds of the next crisis. In these ways, the Bank of England is helping the British economy over the threshold and into strong, sustainable and balanced recovery. Thank you.

2013-10-25	"Mark Carney: The UK at the heart of a renewed globalisation Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at an event to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the Financial Times, London, 24 October 2013.                                                           *      *     *  1.           Introduction When the Financial Times opened for business in 1888 London was the world�s preeminent financial centre. It had the most international banks, the largest capital markets, and the deepest money and gold markets. It backed projects all over the world, and most of world trade was financed by bills drawn on London. Supporting the critical mass of banks, insurers and investors was an army of solicitors, accountants and clerks.1 What London had lacked, at least until the FT�s great rival Financial News was founded in 1884, was a ready provider of financial news. The FT famously set out to report �Without Fear and Without Favour�, and declared itself to be the friend of the honest financier, the respectable broker and the legitimate speculator; and the enemy of the closed stock exchange, the unprincipled promoter and the gambling operator. Perhaps as a consequence, its initial circulation was modest. The preoccupations of 1888 were not very different than today. Editions of the FT 125 years ago contained stories on economic development in China, the health of Spanish government finances, and the state of Irish banks. What is clear in those early editions is the decidedly international flavour of a London investor�s interests � from tramways in Buenos Aires to copper mines in Portugal. Since then, London has been a truly international financial centre. In 1913, at the twilight of the last great wave of globalisation, 71 foreign banks had London offices. A century later, there are nearly four times as many. Today, almost twice as much international banking activity is booked here as anywhere else. London is the home of global markets as well as global banks. Almost half of all turnover in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives takes place here. London�s share of global foreign exchange turnover is almost as high and it remains a major hub for trading in gold. UK insurance companies have around 10% of the global market.2 Extending the net further, the UK is home to the third largest �shadow banking system� with assets of $9 trillion.3 The emergence of London as a financial centre in the nineteenth century owed a lot to the UK�s position as the world�s greatest trading nation. Britain accounted for as much as a quarter of world trade and produced around a tenth of global GDP.4 Over the following    1      At around this time there were 701 accountancy firms operating in the City, and over 2000 firms of solicitors.

Data are available only for 1870 (9%) and 1900 (9.4%), and cover a relatively small sample of      countries, hence the stated share for 1888 is only an approximation.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                                  1 125 years the UK�s shares of world trade and output have fallen to around 3%. Despite some ups and downs, London has remained a centre of global finance. Partly as a consequence, the size of the UK�s financial sector relative to its economy has increased dramatically. When the FT was in its infancy, the assets of UK banks amounted to around 40% of GDP. By the end of last year, that ratio had risen tenfold. As we have recently been painfully reminded, a specialisation in financial services carries risks as well as rewards. And those risks will grow, unless we put global banks and markets on a sounder footing. Suppose, for example, that UK-owned banks� share of global banking activity remains the same and that financial deepening in foreign economies increases in line with historical norms. By 2050, UK banks� assets could exceed nine times GDP, and that is to say nothing of the potentially rapid growth of foreign banking and shadow banking based in London. Some would react to this prospect with horror. They would prefer that the UK financial services industry be slimmed down if not shut down. In the aftermath of the crisis, such sentiments have gone largely unchallenged. But, if organised properly, a vibrant financial sector brings substantial benefits. Today financial services account for a tenth of UK GDP and are the source of over 1 million jobs.5 Two thirds of those are outside London, including jobs in asset management in Edinburgh, transaction processing in Bournemouth and insurance in Norwich. Being at the heart of the global financial system also broadens the investment opportunities for the institutions that look after British savings, and reinforces the ability of UK manufacturing and creative industries to compete globally. Not to mention that financial services represent one of the UK�s largest exports. More broadly, London�s markets serve a vital global role. London acts as Europe�s window to global capital; is a centre of emerging market finance; and can play an important role in the financial opening of China. The UK�s financial sector can be both a global good and a national asset � if it is resilient. It is not for the Bank of England to decide how big the financial sector should be. Our job is to ensure that it is safe. The UK can host a large and expanding financial sector safely, if we implement a reform agenda that extends well beyond domestic banking. That is not to suggest that the focus on reforming domestic banks has been misplaced. Following the crisis, it was imperative to fix first the fault lines at the core of our system, with initiatives ranging from rebuilding the capital of major UK banks and building societies, to changing the structure of compensation and the responsibilities of senior officers. In tandem, some major banks are working to change their cultures.6 But reforms of domestic banking are far from sufficient for a global hub like London. Now is the time for a greater focus on what�s needed for resilient international banking and robust global markets. This will require sustained international engagement. Unlike in the early days of the FT, the UK can no longer dictate standards. Rather than ruling the waves, we must spur collective action through a demonstrated commitment to openness and the promotion of better ideas in Europe and at the G20 via the Financial Stability Board (FSB).     5     As Andy Haldane has noted, the methodology used to calculate output statistics related to financial services is likely to     overstate their true contribution, especially when compensation for risk is high. See �The contribution of the financial sector:     Miracle or Mirage?�, http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2010/speech442.pdf. As banks�     balance sheets have shrunk since the crisis this effect is likely to have lessened. 6     Martin Wheatley spoke yesterday about fairness and the importance of cultural reform, arguing that �the financial world is     responding to the cultural change around it�; see http://www.fca.org.uk/news/the-fairness-challenge.     2                                                                                                       BIS central bankers� speeches More fundamentally, such engagement would be timely because globalisation itself is under siege. Cross-border capital flows have fallen sharply since the crisis. Multilateral trade liberalisation has stalled, to the detriment of global prosperity. If we are to stem this tide towards financial fragmentation we must make global finance more resilient. That serves both national and global interests. Accordingly, I will concentrate today on three core elements of the Bank of England�s new Financial Stability strategy: creating resilient global banks, building robust markets and conducting central banking for global markets. These initiatives support a fourth leg of our strategy: improving the supply of finance in the UK. You will hear more about supply-side initiatives, aimed for example at rebuilding securitisation and supporting SME lending, in coming months.  2.      Strengthening the resilience of international banking Making international banks safer is fundamental to a renewed globalisation. To this end, new global standards for capital and liquidity have been agreed. The major global banks have raised $500 billion of new equity over the past few years and are on course as a group to meet the Basel III standards more than four years in advance of the deadline. In the UK, all major banks and building societies now have in place credible plans to achieve the Bank of England�s thresholds for capital and leverage. To finish the job, international regulators need to agree over the next year new rules for capital to be held in banks� trading books, a simple leverage ratio and a guideline which governs the stability of banks� funding. Alongside these efforts to increase resilience, our focus is on solving the problem of banks that are too big to fail. Systemic resilience depends on being able to resolve failing banks in a way that does not threaten the entire system. Fairness demands the end of a system that privatises gains but socialises losses. And simple economics dictates that the UK state cannot stand behind a banking system that is already many times the size of the economy. Moreover, without a credible means to resolve failing banks, regulatory Balkanisation will continue as national regulators seek to protect their own interests, threatening the efficient operation of the international financial system and accordingly London�s competitiveness. To avoid these risks, we need to make the resolution of global banks a real option. Successful cross-border resolution requires coordination and cooperation between authorities across multiple jurisdictions. This will only work if all authorities are confident that global resolutions will deliver domestic financial stability and protect local services. Cross- border cooperative agreements will help, but fine words must also be backed up by harsh economic incentives. Operating structures of banks must be made consistent with resolvability and, above all, banks must have substantial loss-absorbing capacity that cascades through their group structures. At the St Petersburg summit in September, G20 leaders mandated the FSB to develop these proposals. The Bank of England is now working intensively with other authorities and the financial industry. Our aim is to complete the job by the next G20 Summit in Brisbane. By increasing the resilience of banks and tackling too big to fail we can help make London a safe global banking centre. But that is far from sufficient; we must also dramatically improve the resilience of global markets.  3.          Creating robust markets To do so, we need first to consider how measures to increase the resilience of banks affect the functioning of markets. For example, the combination of higher capital held against    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                     3 trading books, the new leverage ratio, and the proposed Volcker restrictions on proprietary trading have already combined to reduce dealer inventories across a range of securities.7 With dealers less willing to deploy capital against large market moves, volatility has increased and liquidity fallen in the face of shocks such as the potential shift in US monetary policy earlier this year. On the other hand, with limited proprietary positions, banks generally emerged from a summer of stress unscathed. Certainly, no one wants to return to the days when major dealers� trading books were crushed under the weight of worthless leveraged super senior debt. To strike a balance between making banks safer and maintaining adequate market liquidity, we need to draw lessons from the financial crisis, when contagion from stressed banks spread rapidly through the global financial system via counterparty credit concerns, liquidity hoarding and mass deleveraging. In this environment, core funding and OTC derivative markets seized up and conditions were set for the panic that ensued. By contrast, markets with greater transparency and more robust trading and settlement infrastructure, such as equity markets and exchange-traded futures and options, performed rather better. Prices were not always to participants� liking, but these markets remained open. London should lead the way in ensuring that fixed income and derivative markets meet such standards. At the FSB, the Bank of England is helping to devise reforms that increase transparency, build more robust infrastructure and encourage better collateral management. Since collateral management is a cornerstone of resilient markets and goes to the heart of central banking, let me take a few minutes to expand on it.8 Collateral reduces credit risk between market participants and supports market-based sources of credit to the real economy. It is central to the functioning of OTC derivatives markets and the funding of the shadow banking system. Since market-based finance needs good collateral to grow sustainably, its availability directly influences the supply of finance to British households and businesses. The use of collateral is not without risks. When collateral values rise, fixed haircuts allow banks and non-banks to borrow more, pushing up asset values further. The reverse is also true. This inherent pro-cyclicality exposes the system to sharp corrections in collateral values. In extremis, a sell-off in financial markets leads to higher haircuts, a run on repo and ultimately a market freeze. To reduce these risks, the FSB has proposed minimum regulatory standards for collateral valuation and management as well as a schedule of numerical haircut floors to repo transactions. The FSB also now requires central clearing of �standardised� derivative transactions to limit exposures between counterparties, promote efficient netting of positions and moderate collateral cycles. New minimum capital and margining requirements for bilateral OTC derivative trades will similarly protect banks from defaults of their counterparties while reducing procyclicality in the system. The combination of such reforms and the experience of the crisis will mean that institutions both need more collateral and need to manage it better.9 Fortunately financial markets know   7     The ratio of US primary dealer fixed income holdings to bonds outstanding has fallen by between 70% and 85% since 2007.     This measure includes US investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, non-agency MBS and commercial paper, and     excludes government securities and Agency MBS. 8     For a more detailed review of the issues considered here see �The future of repo: �too much� or �too little�?�, a speech by     Andrew Hauser, available at http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2013/speech665.pdf. 9     Estimates reported by the Basel Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) suggest that the combined impact of     liquidity regulation and OTC derivatives reforms could generate additional collateral demand to the tune of $4 trillion.     Depending on the data used, that amounts to at least a third of the high quality collateral in active circulation today. But it is    4                                                                                                         BIS central bankers� speeches how to innovate. Investor expectations for liquidity are changing and models for risk intermediation should evolve in ways that reduce balance sheet usage.  4.          Central banking in global markets Central banks need to keep up. In particular, we can catalyse more efficient and effective private collateral management by backstopping private markets. 140 years ago in Lombard Street, Walter Bagehot expounded the duty of the Bank of England to lend freely to stem a panic and to make loans on �everything which in common times is good �banking security�.� Bagehot was particularly scathing on the Bank�s failure at that time to state a �clear and sound policy� on this general topic writing �...until we have on this point a clear understanding with the Bank of England, both our liability to crises and our terror at crises will always be greater than they would otherwise be.�10 140 years on, the Bank has a clear and sound policy. It is set out in a revised Sterling Monetary Framework (SMF), published today.11 The new framework builds on the lessons learned throughout the financial crisis and draws on the recommendations made by Bill Winters in his review of our system.12 Five simple words describe our approach: we are open for business. Our facilities are not ornamental. They are there to be used by banks to access money and high-quality collateral. We are offering money and collateral for longer terms. The range of assets we will accept in exchange will be wider, extending to raw loans and, in fact, any asset of which we are capable of assessing the risks. And using our facilities will be cheaper. In some cases the fees are being more than halved. Banks can be confident that, when they want to use our facilities, they will be allowed to access them. Because we are both the supervisor and the central bank, the strong presumption is now that, if a bank meets the supervisory threshold conditions to operate and has signed up to our framework, it will be able to use our facilities. Our Discount Window will be open every day for those firms requiring a bespoke facility with lagged disclosure. Its price will be lower. We will hold monthly repo auctions to provide predictable and regular access to high-quality collateral in exchange for a very broad range of collateral. And in times of actual or prospective stressed conditions we stand ready to provide cheap, plentiful money through more frequent auctions. None of this means financial institutions are excused from the need to manage their balance sheets prudently. But as Bill Winters observed, more exacting liquidity requirements mean the conditions for using central bank facilities can be less stringent (and more effective). This is one example of the synergies that arise from the return of banking supervision to the central bank. With our announcements today, we are building a liquidity framework for the markets of tomorrow. In the markets of today, initial usage of these facilities is likely to be limited. The MPC�s stock of asset purchases and the Funding for Lending Scheme currently provide all the liquidity and collateral that the sterling system needs. But as these operations are wound         small relative to the global supply of assets capable of meeting this demand. As the CGFS has recently shown, the stock of      non-cash collateral eligible for derivatives transactions is some $50 trillion, and the supply of AAA� and AA� rated      government bonds alone has risen by nearly $11 trillion since 2007. See the CGFS report, �Asset encumbrance, financial      reform and the demand for collateral assets� available at http://www.bis.org/publ/cgfs49.pdf. 10      Bagehot, W. (1873) �Lombard Street�, particularly pages 205�207. 11      See �Liquidity insurance at the Bank of England: developments in the Sterling Monetary Framework�, available at      www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/Documents/money/publications/liquidityinsurance.pdf. 12      The Winters Review is available on the Bank�s website at      http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/news/2012/cr2winters.pdf.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                                5 down over time, we expect to see banks making increasing use of our new permanent facilities. While today�s announcement is significant, it does not mark the end of history for the Bank of England�s market operations. We will continue to evolve our approach as the financial sector changes. In particular, we need to respond to two big questions. First, should the Bank of England allow non-banks to have access to our regular facilities? After all, our responsibilities for financial stability run much wider than the banking sector. Institutions that play a central role in markets, like broker-dealers, are obvious first candidates. We will also consider the case for opening them to other participants including financial market infrastructures. If the scope of access to central bank facilities increases, the scope of regulation can be expected to expand in a proportionate manner.13 Backstopping the collateral management of a range of institutions should reduce the need for the Bank to act as a Market Maker of Last Resort.14 Second, given that we host an international banking system and global markets, to what extent should the Bank of England provide liquidity in currencies other than sterling? As markets evolve, banks and markets here may need backstops in other currencies in our time zone before business opens for the Federal Reserve and after it has closed for the Bank of Japan. Although the Bank of England can supply limitless quantities of sterling, we rely on other central banks for access to their currencies. In response to the crisis, a network of swap agreements between advanced economy central banks was established giving us the ability to provide a range of currencies to UK-based institutions. This network of swap lines should not necessarily be limited to the G7 economies. In June, the Bank of England signed such an agreement with the People�s Bank of China, reflecting the growing international role of the Renminbi. That dovetails with the possibility of establishing a Renminbi clearing bank in London and our decision to include branches of Chinese banks in our broader policy of openness to hosting foreign wholesale banking activities. Helping the internationalisation of the Renminbi is a global good, consistent with London�s historic role. But rest assured that the Bank will act in a manner consistent with our domestic responsibilities. As my colleague Andrew Bailey said last week, our risk appetite for foreign branches will largely be determined by whether their activities in the UK are covered by credible recovery and resolution plans.15 As always, renewing globalisation and building resilience go hand in hand.  5.          Conclusion After perhaps the worst financial crisis in the FT�s long lifetime, it is reasonable to expect financial services will again grow in importance. The process of financial deepening in emerging markets is only beginning. In Europe, there is a strong case for greater reliance on robust financial markets relative to weakened banks. The UK stands to benefit because of London�s place at the heart of the global financial system. Properly structured, this creates investment opportunities for British savers, reinforces trading ties for UK firms and improves access to credit for the real economy   13      See the FSB�s �Policy Framework for Strengthening Oversight and Regulation of Shadow Banking Entities�,      http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_130829c.htm. 14      Nevertheless, there can sometimes be a case for such action, and the Bank will be considering what it should stand ready      to do and in what circumstances. Clearly the Bank should not support any market that would otherwise be unviable. But we      have, for example, intervened in the corporate bond market, buying and selling bonds to maintain the market during the      crisis until it again became self-sustaining. 15      See http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2013/687.aspx.    6                                                                                                   BIS central bankers� speeches across this country. London�s international markets in turn provide a valuable service to the global economy. These benefits, on both sides, will be greatest as part of an open, integrated global financial system. The Bank of England�s task is to ensure that the UK can host a large and expanding financial sector in a way that promotes financial stability. Only then can it be both a global good and a national asset. To those ends, we are working to complete the jobs of making banks more resilient and tackling too big to fail. We are making markets more robust in order to turn the shadow banking system from a source of risk to a pillar of resilience. And we are changing how we backstop private firms� liquidity management. These efforts will help set the stage to improve further the supply of credit within the UK. Let me put my point more succinctly, in the style of the FT 125 years ago. The Bank of England today is the friend of resilient banks, continuous markets, and good collateral; and we are the enemy of taxpayer bailouts, fragile markets and financial instability. Our circle of friends � like the FT�s readership in its infancy � is expanding. As it does, the UK is helping to renew globalisation to the benefit of all.

2013-12-11	"Mark Carney: The spirit of the season Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, to the Economic Club of New York, New York City, 9 December 2013.                                                  *     *      *  Accompanying charts can be found at the end of the speech.  It is always a pleasure to be in New York during the festive season. At this time of year in this city everything seems possible. However for some time now, appearances have deceived. The hopes and dreams of the holiday season have gone unfulfilled as the bright lights of December have given way to the grim realities of January. Around this time every year policymakers, investors and economists take stock. For four of the past five years, perhaps caught up in the seasonal spirit of goodwill, they have rendered the same verdict: the outgoing year was disappointing but the incoming one will be better (Chart 1). This year is no different. The IMF, the Bank of England and private forecasters all predict faster growth in the advanced and global economies in 2014. Will such hopes again be dashed once the New Year dawns? More profoundly, as the string of disappointments lengthens, some are raising deeper questions. It is being suggested that a malign spirit, a spectre of Christmases past, haunts our future. In particular, no less an authority than Larry Summers has raised the prospect that �secular stagnation� could be the root cause of past excess and current weakness. Today, I want to explore those deeper questions and what they mean for policy. But before raising the pessimists� challenge, let me first keep with recent practice by setting out this year�s reasons for optimism.  Grounds for optimism The news from the UK is positive. Inflation has fallen, from more than 5% in 2011 to 2.2% now, jobs are being created at a rate of 60,000 per month, and growth is � for the moment � the strongest in the advanced world.1 This recovery is relatively recent, having started in earnest during the second quarter of the year. Its timing and pace caught most unawares. Certainly, the cumulative run of economic surprises has dwarfed those of the other major advanced economies (Chart 2). With the wisdom of hindsight, there were three main drivers of the recovery: a marked reduction in extreme uncertainty (Chart 3); significant progress on repairing the core of the financial system, with risk-weighted capital ratios doubling in recent years; and a marked improvement in household balance sheets, where debt to income ratios have fallen by about 30 percentage points. Together, improved access to finance and raised expectations of future prospects led to a reduction in precautionary savings by households, a modest recovery in consumer spending, a revival in housing investment from very low levels and an increase in business confidence to a 15-year high. The American and British experiences underscore that recovery is not possible without a meaningful and transparent re-capitalisation of the banking system, and that households need to de-lever before they have the confidence to consume again.     1     60,000 jobs per month in the UK is roughly the equivalent of monthly increases in US non-farm payrolls of     300,000.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                              1 The question now is whether such progress is sufficient for durable, strong and balanced recoveries over the medium term.  Growing pessimism The pessimists would argue that it isn�t. Their case starts from the observation that advanced economy growth rates remain below pre-crisis trends, despite the scale of the fall and years of emergency monetary stimulus. More fundamentally, pessimists point to the pre-crisis period when (retrospectively) loose financial conditions did not generate a boom in output and associated inflation. They ask: could stagnation be the new normal? Today I want to consider two possible explanations for why advanced economies may have entered a low growth phase. First, on the demand side, they could be in a persistent liquidity trap, making it difficult for resources to be fully utilized, and second, there may have been a persistent deterioration in the supply side such that full utilisation of resources is consistent with slower growth.  1.       Persistent liquidity trap A liquidity trap occurs when the short-term nominal interest rate hits the zero lower bound. Typically in a liquidity trap, the equilibrium real interest rate is negative, creating a persistent inability to match aggregate demand and supply. Before proceeding, I should make clear what I mean by the equilibrium (or natural) real interest rate. Let me use Roger Ferguson�s definition: it is the level of the real policy rate that, if allowed to prevail for several years, would place economic activity at its potential and keep inflation low and stable. For small open economies, like the UK, that equilibrium real rate is determined at the global level by the balance of the supply of savings and demand for investment. In the run-up to the crisis, that balance had shifted decisively as what Chairman Bernanke christened a �savings glut� from emerging economies developed. The flipside of that was low demand for advanced economy exports and low domestic demand in emerging economies. Only very low global real interest rates could spur sufficient domestic demand in advanced economies to maintain activity at its potential level. The problem of course was that the expansion of demand in advanced economies largely took the form of unsustainable consumption rather than business investment. The ensuing financial crisis pushed the equilibrium real interest rate down further and, with nominal interest rates stuck at zero and inflation low, monetary policy was unable to push actual real rates to a level low enough to maintain full employment. The danger in such a situation is that it can become unstable as weak demand and uncertainty cause companies to hold back investment and households to postpone spending. With the balance of savings and investment deteriorating, the equilibrium real interest rate falls even further. At the same time, wages and prices are forced down, pushing actual real interest rates higher. A deflationary spiral results. That is not the only danger. Attempts to reach a very low or negative equilibrium real interest rate � both through conventional reductions in short-term interest rates and through unconventional asset purchases � can risk generating unbalanced, unsustainable demand. In particular, as my predecessor Mervyn King has emphasised, by encouraging spending to be brought forward from the future and debt to be accumulated in the present, a greater shortage of demand tomorrow will develop unless the income of those who have taken on     2                                                                              BIS central bankers� speeches the debt picks up.2 If it does not, monetary policy will have to �double down� in order to sustain demand. Such compounding stimulus could promote financial vulnerabilities through an indiscriminate search for yield, a compression of risk premia to unsustainable levels or via extrapolative expectations of future asset prices. Perceptions of a �central bank put� � where the market interprets all bad news as good news because it will be met with more central bank stimulus � can reinforce these risks. When the inevitable correction finally occurs, the shortfall in demand and scale of the liquidity trap is insurmountable. To what extent does this sketch resemble the current situation in the UK? As its policy stance reflects, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) judges that the equilibrium real interest rate has been, and continues to be, negative. Despite very low interest rates, resources are not fully employed. 850,000 more people are out of work than in the years before the crisis and GDP is around 20% below an extrapolation of its pre-crisis trend. As bad as these figures are, the scale of the mismatch between aggregate supply and demand has not been large enough to generate a deflationary spiral. Despite persistently weak nominal wage growth, rising import prices and weak productivity growth have meant that the UK�s problem has been the need to bring inflation back to the target from above. In this regard, there has been welcome progress. Headline inflation has fallen back much sooner than we expected at the start of the year, and core inflation measures are running close to but slightly below the 2% target. What then of the risks of unbalanced growth? This is more delicate. Despite admirable progress by British households in recent years, aggregate debt levels remain high at 140% of incomes. In addition, housing activity is picking up and price growth appears to be gaining momentum. Moreover, the UK current account deficit is near record levels. These developments merit vigilance but not panic. The housing recovery could reflect higher future income expectations, prompted by the nascent recovery, and better credit conditions. Although the current account position underscores the need for the recovery to shift over time towards investment and export growth, it would be unreasonable to expect that to have happened already. Recoveries are seldom led by investment and strong demand from the UK�s major trading partners, including the euro zone, appears some way off. Ultimately, a sustained recovery in the UK will require a more robust and balanced global recovery. In summary, the UK has been in a situation where the equilibrium real rate of interest has been negative, but with monetary policy gaining traction, there is early evidence that the liquidity trap will be escaped over time. That is not to suggest the warnings are without merit, that interest rates can return to normal soon, that the risks to financial stability arising from the emergency stance of monetary policy are not real, or that escape would bring the freedom to grow at historic rates. It is in this last respect that the second story for a �secular stagnation�, persistently weak supply, is most relevant.  2.          Supply pessimism In many advanced economies, despite persistently disappointing output growth, unemployment rates have remained surprisingly low. Based on a simple Okun relationship, the current UK unemployment rate would be expected to be closer to 14% and the US rate to be around 10%. In fact, they are 7.6% and 7.0% respectively (Chart 4).     2      A point emphasised by Mervyn King, for example here: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/      Documents/speeches/2012/speech613.pdf.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                       3 These discrepancies have reinforced the worries of some that weak potential supply growth will constrain the pace of recovery. Possible explanations for such weakness range from demographics to a slowing in the rate of technological progress. It seems unlikely that communicating in 140 characters � useful discipline though that is � represents the apex of human progress. Nor should central banks always and everywhere take supply as exogenous. Central banks can affect people�s decisions about how much to work and firms� decisions about how much to invest. When the outlook is particularly uncertain, as it is in the wake of a major financial crisis, this influence could affect potential supply. Monetary policymakers must consider the extent to which their decisions affect, not just depend on, the path of output.3 In the US this question has been the subject of much debate. A recent Federal Reserve Board paper argues that potential supply growth is likely to respond to demand as the economy recovers, for example through capital deepening, as well as the behaviour of the labour market.4 The rise in unemployment here in the US has been tempered by a fall in the rate of labour force participation and a slowdown in productivity growth (Charts 4 and 5). It is quite possible that, with a recovery in demand, those discouraged from looking for work will return to the labour force. Given the risks of hysteresis, that is more likely to happen the more quickly demand recovers. This dynamic suggests scope for a strong recovery in which falls in unemployment are much more limited than usual. Potential growth in the UK could also be pro-cyclical but for different reasons. In Britain, the employment rate has fallen only a third as much as in the US (Chart 6). The flipside of that strength has been exceptionally weak productivity growth (Chart 7). Will UK productivity growth pick up alongside demand? The fundamentals are promising. Given the flexibility of its labour market, the continued openness of the economy and the credibility of macro policy, it is hard to think of any reason why there should have been a persistent deterioration in the rate of potential growth in Britain. This hypothesis holds particularly now that the UK financial system is beginning to function more effectively. Until recently, the weakness of the banking system limited the reallocation of capital and labour from less to more productive activities. Indeed, whereas half of all productivity growth at the economy-wide level in the years prior to 2008 occurred through this channel, reallocation appears to have made no contribution to productivity growth in recent years.5 There are other reasons to think that growth itself should bring a supply side improvement. As the economy recovers, investment should pick up and part-time workers should shift into more productive full-time work. With the sharp fall in real wages during the recession (Chart 8), employees effectively priced themselves into low-productivity work at a time of weak demand. To the extent that this allows skills to be retained and reduces costs of replacing     3     In economists� jargon, the extent to which potential supply is endogenous. This opens the possibility of there     being �multiple equilibria�, something my colleague David Miles has reminded us was a central message of     Keynes but that has been lost to much of the latest generation of New Keynesian modelling.

It would be unreasonable to expect these positive outcomes to materialise immediately. Weak growth may have meant that companies have missed out on productivity advances that would otherwise have been made through learning by doing. Skills have atrophied through underemployment rather than unemployment. The recovery will therefore need to be sustained for a period before productivity � and real wage � gains can resume in earnest. That picture is borne out in the latest UK data, which show that the early phase of recovery has been accompanied by some productivity gains but also by further strong employment gains. In summary, while the UK�s experience does not rule out the possibility that supply growth has slowed, the thesis is only beginning to be tested. And the nature of the slowdown, particularly in the labour market, suggests that supply will likely increase with demand for some time.  Policy implications The risks to supply and the risks associated with the liquidity trap imply that central banks need to deploy a wide range of policies in a coordinated fashion. The most obvious implication is that monetary policy should respond aggressively. To prevent the liquidity trap from becoming a coffin, central banks have set monetary policy at emergency levels by reducing short-term interest rates to their lowest feasible levels, undertaking large-scale asset purchases, and pursuing targeted interventions to ease funding and credit conditions. The possibility that potential supply will itself depend on the speed of recovery reinforces this policy bias. Forward guidance is integral to the response. It reduces uncertainty by providing reassurance that monetary policy will not be tightened prematurely before the recovery is sufficiently entrenched to sustain higher rates. This helps give households and businesses the confidence to spend and invest. And, by setting a threshold for the unemployment rate, guidance helps us to test the endogeneity of supply. If supply responds to recovering demand, unemployment will fall more slowly than otherwise and the point at which we will re-evaluate the stance of monetary policy will come later. What of unbalanced growth? The Bank of England is alive to the risks of extended stimulus, and given its responsibility for macro-prudential policy, it can act in a timely fashion to mitigate them. The Bank demonstrated this flexibility recently with a package of measures targeted at the housing market, and it has outlined a broad range of additional tools if further action were required. The synergies of combining the monetary and macro-prudential authorities in one institution could be considerable. By sharing analysis and clearly assigning a hierarchy of responsibilities between them, the Bank�s MPC and its financial policy equivalent, the FPC, are ensuring that measures are timely, proportionate and targeted. For example, the Bank�s Funding for Lending scheme, originally put in place for monetary policy purposes, was refocused from household to small business lending for financial stability purposes. Similarly, both committees have made it clear that monetary policy is the last line of defence against financial stability risks, thereby establishing clear lines of responsibility and accountability. This coordination is particularly important if either of the �secular stagnation� stories is relevant. By addressing risks to financial stability, the Bank�s FPC helps ensure that monetary policy can remain as stimulative as necessary for as long as necessary to achieve its objectives. In doing so, it reduces the risk of a deepening liquidity trap caused by compounding debt-fuelled consumption. And it helps to lay bare more clearly the underlying growth potential of the economy.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  5 The third aspect of the policy response is better financial regulation and supervision. In both the US and UK, the repair of the financial sector was a prerequisite for recovery. Indeed, one of the reasons behind a persistently negative equilibrium real interest rate has been the restricted supply of credit from a damaged banking system. Going forward, financial reforms will help guard against excessive pro-cyclicalities that could emerge in a �low for long� environment. But financial reform is about much more than fixing the failings in advanced economies; it is one of the keys to rebalancing the global economy. The global savings glut will not disappear in the absence of further financial liberalisation in China. That will only proceed if there is a transparent, resilient global financial system worth joining, and will only be completed by further internationalisation of the renminbi. Those realities are key reasons why the Bank of England is so engaged in the work of the Financial Stability Board and has moved to support London as a hub for renminbi clearing.  Conclusion For the first time in a long time it seems reasonable to expect the hopes and dreams of the holiday season to be fulfilled. The Ghost of Christmas Present is a cheerful spirit. As uncertainty diminishes, credit conditions improve and balance sheet repair progresses, monetary policy is gaining traction. The strength of the UK recovery and the fall in its unemployment rate suggest that the equilibrium real interest rate is now rising gradually back towards zero. The Ghost of Christmas Past should not be forgotten. A recovery may be gaining pace but our economies are a long way from normal. Leverage is still high and weak demand for advanced economy exports could persist for some time. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come suggests that it is unlikely that equilibrium interest rates will return to historically normal levels any time soon. This prospect puts a premium on macro-prudential policies and financial reforms to manage the associated risks without abandoning the need to keep interest rates in line with the equilibrium level. So while it is unsurprising that the ideas behind secular stagnation are being revived, it would be a mistake to rush to a more extreme macroeconomic response. There is a long history of pessimism in economics, from Thomas Malthus through Alvin Hansen to Robert Gordon. Such worries have proven misplaced in the past and scepticism is warranted now. Don�t forget that the US economy is more than 13 times larger than when Hansen first formulated his ideas. Similar performance must again be possible. Central banks are playing a catalytic role to help deliver it but their contribution will ultimately be limited. The most important drivers of long term prosperity will be measures taken by others to increase the growth of supply, particularly those that reinforce an open, global economy. Such good deeds will truly merit the goodwill of all men and women.

2013-12-18	"Mark Carney: Polymer banknotes Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Bank of England, London, 18 December 2013.                                              *   *    *  Ensuring public trust and confidence in money is at the heart of what central banks do. Money can only play its invaluable role in our economy if that trust and confidence is maintained. That motivates the Bank of England�s core objectives of price stability, so that people can be confident of the value of their money over time, and financial stability so that they will be able to access and use money when they want to. It is also why we place such importance on maintaining confidence in our banknotes, the most tangible form of money. Our job is to ensure that the banknotes people use are high quality and genuine. We also recognise that banknotes are an important national symbol and a source of national pride. Our banknotes must therefore be secure from counterfeiting, resistant to damage, and designed in a way that inspires broad public support and fosters legitimacy. We are continually working to ensure that our notes meet those requirements. That is why I am pleased to announce today that the next Bank of England notes will be printed on polymer, rather than cotton paper. The first polymer note will be the �5 note featuring Sir Winston Churchill, and will be issued in 2016. It will be followed around a year later by a polymer �10 note featuring Jane Austen. The decision to move to polymer for these notes follows a three-year review and a broad public consultation exercise. Our research has shown a compelling case for polymer notes. Polymer notes bring three main benefits: �           They stay cleaner than paper banknotes because they are resistant to dirt and             moisture; �           They are more secure because they incorporate advanced security features that             make them difficult to counterfeit; �           And they are more durable, lasting at least 2� times as long as paper banknotes,             ensuring that notes in circulation remain of high quality. Because replacements are             needed less often they are both cheaper over time, and more environmentally             friendly. These advantages mean that a switch to polymer is a natural step in the evolution of banknote design. But you don�t have to take our word for it. Nearly 13000 people have told us what they thought, in surveys and at over 40 events up and down the UK, and 87% � the vast majority � were in favour of polymer notes, especially once they had a chance to see and handle prototype notes. After that public consultation, we�re confident that the switch to polymer will have broad public support. For those who might be concerned about the change, let me reassure you that the new polymer notes will retain the familiar look of Bank of England banknotes, including of course the portrait of Her Majesty the Queen, as well as depictions of historical characters of national significance. That continuity of design helps explain why people who have had a chance to handle specimen notes were even more likely to view polymer favourably. The depiction of historical characters will remain an integral feature of our banknotes, providing an opportunity to celebrate individuals that have shaped the United Kingdom. In     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                 1 order to ensure public confidence in banknotes, it is essential that the choice of characters commands broad public respect and legitimacy. That is why in July, at the same time as announcing that Jane Austen would feature on the new �10 note, I promised that we would review the way in which the characters featured on banknotes are selected. Today we are announcing a new set of principles to guide the choice of characters and a new process to ensure that those principles are, and are seen to be, followed. The new principles for character selection state clearly and positively the Bank�s aims in using historic characters on our notes. They put diversity and inclusivity at the heart of the selection criteria. And they make clear our intention to portray a diverse range of characters over time, with each new decision taking into account previous choices. The new process will be open, transparent and inclusive. There will be greater input from the public and from external experts in the form of a new Advisory Committee with a majority of independent members. That body will recommend a broad theme � for example scientific achievement � before the public are invited to nominate characters within that theme. The Advisory Committee, with input from public focus groups, will narrow down the field to a final shortlist of characters and the Governor will make the final choice from that shortlist. These changes will ensure that the characters on our banknotes are fully representative of the history and diversity of this great nation, while having the necessary public respect and legitimacy. Our polymer notes will combine the best of progress and tradition. They will be more secure from counterfeiting and more resistant to damage while celebrating the history and tradition that is important both to the Bank and the nation as a whole. By consulting widely on the switch to polymer, and by putting in place a new process for selecting banknote characters with much more public input, we have reinforced the commitment to openness and transparency which lies at the heart of the Bank of England�s commitment to accountability. Together, these announcements ensure that our banknotes will remain both a national symbol and a source of national pride.     2                                                                         BIS central bankers� speeches"
2014-01-24	"Mark Carney: Global economic outlook, financial reform and UK monetary policy Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Davos CBI British Business Leaders Lunch, Davos, 24 January 2014.                                             *    *   *  When a banker invites a regulator to a meeting on a mountainside, the regulator gets suspicious. At 5000 feet, �cliff effect� takes on a whole new meaning. That�s one of the reasons why I am pleased to have so many distinguished witnesses here today. While Douglas Flint may have had terminal velocity in mind for me, I am more interested in discussing the prospects of the global and British economies achieving escape velocity. In physics, escape velocity refers to the speed necessary to escape from a planet�s gravitational pull. The economic analogue is the momentum necessary for an economy to escape from the many headwinds following a financial crisis. A few quarters of above-trend growth driven by household spending represent a good start, but they aren�t sufficient. It will take sustained growth, more balanced demand and a recovery in the supply side for advanced economies to break free into a more normal universe. Today, I would like to speak to the contribution of central banks to make this happen.  1.          Global economic outlook Over the past year, the global economy has picked up and tail risks have decreased. After rising to an expected 3.5 percent this year, global growth could finally re-attain its pre-crisis trend of 4 percent in 2015. Three quarters of this acceleration is expected to be driven by advanced economies, with the US and the UK leading the pack. And this isn�t the best case scenario. Even in the euro area, risks have become two-sided, albeit around a modest growth rate of about 1%. None of this is to suggest that current levels of economic activity are acceptable or that the world economy is no longer under strain. After the Great Moderation and the Great Recession, there are several reasons why it will be years before any superlatives are attached to this recovery. First, for all the talk of austerity and deleveraging, the aggregate debt burdens of advanced economies have actually increased; with their total non-financial sector debt rising by 25% relative to GDP since 2007. Balance sheet repair in the public and private sectors will exert a persistent drag on major economies for some time. Second, the need to rebalance demand from deficit to surplus countries endures. Given the adjustment pressures on the former, without progress on rebalancing, robust and sustainable global growth will remain an aspiration. Third, confidence, while improved, remains subdued. Recognising that the end isn�t nigh is far from marking the normalisation of business and consumer sentiment. Given past shocks and modest prospects, business investment in particular remains hesitant across the advanced world. On balance, corporations remain more focused on reducing operating expenditures than increasing capital expenditures. This focus is helping to contain inflationary pressures in the near term. Indeed, across advanced economies, wage growth remains weak and labour markets soft. Reflecting the combination of improving, but still subdued, demand and considerable, if uncertain, slack, monetary policy remains exceptionally stimulative. Recall that the recent    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                   1 decision of the Federal Reserve to begin tapering asset purchases meant only slowing the rate of additional stimulus. And that the 7% unemployment rate in the UK is merely the point at which the MPC begins to even think about adjusting policy. The key question for central banks is the expected evolution of the supply side of their economies. This is unusually uncertain at present. We know that our economies are operating well below their, admittedly unsustainable, pre-crisis trends, but we don�t know how much capacity was destroyed following the crisis. We know that depressed business investment is limiting productivity growth in the short term, but we don�t know to what extent and whether such shortfalls can be caught up. From a longer perspective, we know that total factor productivity growth has slowed over the past decade, but given the incredible flourishing of innovation, we don�t know whether this is due to lags, measurement errors or more fundamental factors. Statistical trend measures of labour productivity growth suggest it has slowed in the United States, the euro area (both core and periphery), the UK and even Korea. By this point, buffeted by gloom and uncertainty, you may be considering joining the bankers in pushing me off the mountainside, so let me begin to outline how we can address these challenges. We can start by recalling that the global economy has been in similar circumstances before. Everyone knows that the 1930s marked the depressing aftermath of a great financial crisis. Less well-appreciated was that it also marked a period of intense innovation that laid the groundwork for post-war growth, particularly in the United States. Alexander Field in his book �A Great Leap Forward� contends that the 1930s were the most technologically progressive decade of the 20th century. He notes the development of chemical-based materials like Teflon, Nylon and synthetic rubber; the development of the Television, and the expansion of the public road network that paved the way for advances in distribution and transportation. In the 1930s, the collapse of demand meant mass unemployment and slow adoption of new technologies. It took a recovery in aggregate demand after the Great Depression, partly spurred by mobilisation for the Second World War, for many innovations to be applied and new markets to develop. Demand was persistently weak in the 1930s because policy mistakes were legion. A protectionist backlash closed global markets and ended global finance. Policies favouring liquidation led to widespread bank failures. Monetary policy was tightened dramatically. This time, thus far, is different. Protectionism is being resisted, banks recapitalised, and the global financial system rebuilt. In parallel, monetary policy is highly accommodative. As the global economy gains momentum, staying the course on these policies will be decisive to achieving escape velocity. The United Kingdom is at the centre of these decisions. Let me expand.  2.       Financial reform In recent years, protectionism has been the dog that didn�t bark. Although gently mocked, the G20 pledge to resist protectionism has been largely respected. In contrast, some major trade deals have been signed (such as between Canada and Europe), and other even more significant ones are in train. The UK can help spur on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership discussions on wide ranging free trade between the EU and the US. In tandem with keeping the global trading system working is the re-founding of an integrated, open global financial system. As the leading global financial centre, the UK will be central to completing the job of financial reform. The UK financial system is both a global good � it supports an open global system � and a national asset. To realise its potential, we need our system to be safe, fair and to act   2                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches with integrity. Without those foundations, the innovation for which finance in the UK is renowned will be meaningless. A safe system means resilient banks and markets that together can absorb rather than amplify shocks. Much has been achieved in recent years to repair the core of the banking system. Minimum capital requirements for the world�s largest banks have been increased seven-fold. These banks are on course to meet these new requirements five years before the deadline, having raised more than half a trillion dollars of new equity. In the UK alone they have raised �140bn. To ensure that this is sufficient, the Bank of England will begin annual concurrent stress tests of major institutions this year. The Bank is also working with international peers to tackle worryingly large differences in bank risk models through tighter supervision, more standardised approaches and better disclosure. To make markets safer, funding and derivatives markets are being overhauled. Recognising that this will transform the use and importance of collateral, the Bank is reforming our market operations. We are also working to develop market-based sources of finance so that the real economy can be less reliant on banks. To make the system fairer, the days when banks privatised gains but socialised losses must end. The Bank is at the forefront of international efforts to agree common standards to create classes of debt holders that can be bailed in to recapitalise failing institutions. By complementing this so-called gone concern loss absorbing capacity with cross border agreements, plans on resolution, and new derivative contracts with automatic stays, we can create the situation where the incentives of shareholders, management, bondholders, and citizens are aligned. Firms that take excessive risks will bear the full consequences of the market; consumers, businesses and taxpayers who rely on critical banking services will not. It is not the Bank of England�s role to champion the City. By making it safer and fairer we can put in place the conditions for it to thrive. But whether or not it thrives will rest on the efforts of individuals and organisations to re-establish the system�s reputation for integrity. While regulators will fix the mechanics of benchmarks in markets ranging from LIBOR to FX, only private individuals and institutions can reform the behaviour that has made such changes necessary. Changes to the structure of compensation will better align the incentives of bank staff and their shareholders, but not every risk can be anticipated. Even if such a package could be devised it would not internalise the impact of individual actions on systemic risks, including on trust in the banking system. For the system to operate with integrity, penalties for misconduct cannot be seen as a cost of doing business. Rather, banks must recognise that only exemplary behaviour can confer social licence to global financial capitalism. More fundamentally, integrity cannot be legislated, and it certainly cannot be bought. Only a perspective which takes into account the wider implications of actions can guide proper behaviour. And while regulators can promote competition, end the subsidy enjoyed by institutions that are too big to fail, and determine the appropriate split of remuneration between fixed and variable elements to limit risks to financial stability, only society, not regulators, can determine whether the absolute and relative levels of compensation are acceptable.  3.          UK monetary policy Measures to make the system safer, fairer and to operate with more integrity are re-founding a more resilient, open global financial system. This sets the stage for monetary policy to support a supply side recovery. Ben Bernanke once said to Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, �You [were] right, we [the Fed] did it [caused the great depression]. But thanks to you, we won�t do it again.� Thanks in   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                        3 part to Chairman Bernanke�s leadership, central banks have pursued the opposite strategy to the 1930s to great effect. While the human cost since 2008 has been considerable, it is dwarfed by the experience of the Great Depression. Central banks haven�t done it again, but that doesn�t mean they should be satisfied. There remains still considerable, if uncertain, slack in their economies. I say uncertain because obvious measures of slack, such as unemployment, are much lower than we would have expected given the scale of the fall in demand. Supply side performance in advanced economies has been surprisingly poor. Before the crisis, the growth in potential supply was largely predictable (technically a stationary trend). As a consequence, central bankers responded to movements in demand around that trend. The issue now is the extent to which the fall in demand has itself eroded potential supply and whether that could be reversed as economies recover. In the US, the question is whether labour force participation rates will pick up. In the UK, the question is whether labour productivity will reverse any of its poor performance. These questions mean it makes sense for policy to test the extent to which supply performance is �endogenous� to demand.1 This is one of the main advantages of the forward guidance employed by both the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve. Last August the Bank�s Monetary Policy Committee made an easy call: we wouldn�t even begin to think about raising interest rates until the unemployment rate fell to 7%. Given the weakness of the UK recovery and the flexibility of the labour market, we could expect that considerable slack would ensure that the MPC was not taking undue risks with inflation as policy encouraged faster output and employment growth. To be clear, the Bank continues to be mindful of the risks posed by sustained exceptionally loose monetary policy. In some advanced economies like the UK, these risks relate mainly to housing markets. In emerging market economies, they centre on the volatility of capital flows. Across the financial sector, a low for long environment risks complacency, excessive risk taking and undisciplined underwriting. In all cases, authorities can and should look to macro- prudential policy tools to manage these risks so that monetary policy can remain focussed on its objective of establishing the conditions for a sustained recovery while maintaining price stability. Given the powers and remit of the Financial Policy Committee, the Bank of England is exceptionally well-positioned to coordinate macroprudential and monetary policies. Since August, inflation has fallen back to target (for the first time in 5 years) and unemployment has fallen rapidly towards 7%, so what have we learned on the journey towards our threshold? With the wisdom of hindsight, there have been three main drivers of the recovery thus far: a marked reduction in extreme uncertainty, the repair of the core of the financial system and significant deleveraging by households. These have driven a recovery in consumer spending and housing investment, which together have accounted for almost all the GDP growth in the year to Q3. As my colleague Ian McCafferty outlined earlier this week, there are also early signs of a recovery in business investment. The less good news is that the recovery has not � as measured at least � been accompanied by meaningful productivity growth. Given the continued openness of the economy and the credibility of macro policy, it is hard to think of any reason why there should have been a persistent deterioration the UK�s    1     My MPC colleague Ben Broadbent discussed these issues extensively in September 2013 in a speech at the     London Business School, �Conditional guidance as a response to supply uncertainty�.    4                                                                                   BIS central bankers� speeches productivity performance. In fact there are several reasons to expect productivity growth to pick up as the recovery proceeds. For example, until recently, the fragility of the banking system limited the reallocation of capital and labour from less to more productive activities. Indeed, whereas half of all productivity growth at the economy-wide level in the years prior to 2008 occurred through this channel, reallocation appears to have made no contribution to productivity growth in recent years. With the progress made in fixing the banking system, this negative should become a positive. Second, it is possible that with the sharp fall in real wages during the recession employees effectively priced themselves into low-productivity work at a time of weak demand. To the extent that this allows skills to be retained and reduces costs of replacing particularly skilled employees as the recovery takes hold, the recovery could generate greater productivity as it proceeds. Third, traditional pro-cyclicalities in productivity growth such as learning-by-doing and economies of scale should begin to operate. Finally, accelerating business investment, evident in surveys and increasingly necessitated by the recovery itself, should increase output per hour. Nevertheless, it appears that the recovery will need to be sustained for a period before productivity gains can resume in earnest. The latest data show that more than a quarter of a million jobs were created in a three-month period � the biggest increase since records began in 1971. As a result, unemployment seems to be falling at a pace that will reach our 7% threshold materially earlier than we had expected. Crucially, unemployment remains above the level that is likely to be consistent with maintaining inflation at the target in the medium term. It is not just that nearly three quarters of a million more people are out of work than before the crisis; another three quarters of a million more people are involuntarily working part time. The effect of this slack in the labour market is evident in wage inflation, which is at around 1% so that, even with weak productivity, unit labour cost growth remains below 2%. The fact that underemployment is exerting downward pressure on costs also reflects better than expected performance on the supply side of the labour market. In the jargon, the extent to which high unemployment has caused hysteresis seems to have been less than in past recessions. It now seems likely that the rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation in the medium term is somewhat lower than the MPC assessed back in August.2 In part that is because rates of transition into jobs, even for those who have been unemployed for more than a year, have been sustained at high rates, minimising the extent of skill atrophy. In addition, other measures of slack in the labour market, such as involuntary part-time working remain high.     2     �Monetary policy, trade-offs and forward guidance� Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee, August     2013, p 34. �Since the medium-term equilibrium unemployment rate depends on the composition of     unemployment, it will change over time�That medium-term equilibrium unemployment rate is a different     concept from the long-run equilibrium unemployment rate: the latter is the rate to which unemployment will     trend towards in the long run once all of the short and medium-term effects have dissipated. That long-run     equilibrium rate will reflect the institutional features of the labour market, such as the degree of labour market     flexibility, and the extent to which potential employees are aligned with vacancies in terms of skills, location     and occupation. Over time, the medium-term equilibrium unemployment rate should converge towards the     long-run rate. Current estimates of the long-run equilibrium rate are significantly below estimates of the     medium-term equilibrium rate.�    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                       5 This suggests that, even though unemployment is falling faster than expected, the recovery has some way to run before it would be appropriate to consider moving away from the emergency setting of monetary policy. It is widely recognised that our 7% threshold is not a trigger for raising Bank Rate. Last August, the MPC said that when the 7% unemployment threshold was reached, there should be no assumption of an immediate, automatic change to its policy stance. It would assess the prevailing economic conditions, including wider measures of slack and inflationary pressures, before deciding the appropriate stance for monetary policy. That the attainment of the 7% threshold will not be associated with any immediate need to raise Bank Rate is reinforced by recent developments suggesting that UK inflation pressures are more contained. In particular, inflation has fallen from 5% in 2011 back to the target for the first time since 2009. Global inflation is subdued, with both euro area and US consumer price inflation now less than 1%; oil prices have fallen by 4% relative to a year ago; other commodity prices have fallen by more than 10%, and sterling has appreciated by almost 9% since last summer. All of these developments will hold back imported inflation pressures that have to a great extent explained the above-target inflation over the past five years. The Bank�s assessment of how to evolve guidance to changing circumstances will begin in our February Inflation Report. The MPC will consider a range of options to update our guidance, recognising both what we have learned about the behaviour of aggregate supply in the economy as well as the more benign inflation outlook. The MPC has noted that when the time eventually comes to begin to move away from emergency settings of policy, any such move would be gradual. The degree of stimulus will remain exceptional for some time. That should help reassure British business that the path of interest rates will be consistent with a sustained recovery � that is, with escape velocity. This recognises that many of the headwinds holding back the economy will remain for some time yet. Public and private balance sheets continue to be repaired. World demand remains weak and the appreciation of sterling will hold back the expansion of net exports. And there remain strains in the financial system despite good progress on post-crisis repair. These persistent headwinds mean that, even in the medium term, the level of interest rates necessary to sustain low unemployment and price stability will be somewhat lower than before the crisis. In the jargon, the equilibrium real interest rate, which has been negative for much of the period since the crisis, will eventually turn positive again, but it is likely to remain well below historical norms. Escape velocity won�t come cheap. The Bank of England is helping to build the foundations for Britain�s future success: the conditions for recovery while maintaining price stability; a financial system that is safe and does not impose losses on the taxpayer. On those foundations, Britain�s businesses can build again, through investment and innovation, the country�s future prosperity.     6                                                                              BIS central bankers� speeches"
2014-01-29	"Mark Carney: The economics of currency unions Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, at a lunch hosted by the Scottish Council for Development & Industry, Edinburgh, 29 January 2014.                                             *    *    *  It is a pleasure to be in Scotland today and to have the opportunity to hear directly from businesses about the economy. The recovery that began in Scotland has now taken hold in the UK with the economy growing at its fastest rate since 2007. Although a few quarters of above-trend growth driven by household spending represent a good start, they aren�t sufficient. Even though employment is growing and unemployment has fallen � particularly so recently in Scotland � the recovery has some way to run before it would be appropriate to consider moving away from the emergency setting of monetary policy. The Monetary Policy Committee has noted that, when the time eventually comes to increase interest rates, any such move would be gradual. That should help to reassure businesses in Scotland and all around the UK that the path of interest rates will be consistent with achieving a sustained and balanced recovery in the face of the remaining headwinds stemming from the financial crisis. Scotland is a land rich in history and ideas, and one to which I owe a great debt. Scots built the very foundations of my native land, Canada, whose first Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald was born in Glasgow. Scots have shaped the modern world through their contributions to culture and science. The pioneering work of Scottish economists from Adam Smith to Sir James Mirrlees has had great influence on my profession. Among them is David Hume, born just a short walk from here and a great friend and collaborator of Smith. While better known as a philosopher, Hume�s essay �Of the balance of trade� set out the theory of how trade imbalances between nations sharing a currency (gold) would self-correct as inflows of money to surplus countries raised their prices and reduced their competitiveness. As an empiricist, Hume would doubtless admit that recent euro area experience of persistent current account deficits leading not to self-correction but instead to crisis requires a more elaborate explanation. Fortunately economists have over the years obliged with substantial work on the economics of currency unions. Given the recent focus here on the currency and the fundamental role of the Bank of England in maintaining monetary and financial stability across the United Kingdom, I want to draw on that body of economics today to review some of the most important issues with respect to monetary union. I will stick rigidly to what Thomas Carlyle described as the dismal science. Any arrangement to retain sterling in an independent Scotland would need to be negotiated between the Westminster and Scottish Parliaments. The Bank of England would implement whatever monetary arrangements were put in place. What follows is not an assessment of whether Scotland will be overall better or worse off under independence � that is a multi-faceted judgement for the Scottish people. It does not pass judgement on the relative merits of the different currency options for an independent Scotland, but instead draws attention to the key issues. This is a technocratic assessment of what makes an effective currency union between independent nations.  The costs and benefits of currency areas Let me begin by outlining the basic rationale for sharing a currency.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  1 Economist Robert Mundell first wrote about what determined an �optimum currency area�1 Spurred by the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system and the move to floating exchange rates as well as by the formation of the European Monetary Union, others have elaborated and extended his work. We now have a fairly comprehensive sense of the costs and benefits of sharing a currency. For Mundell, the main benefit was that it eliminates the transactions costs associated with using, and switching between, different currencies. The European Commission estimated the size of these direct benefits for Europe to be almost 0.5% of GDP every year.2 Sharing a currency can promote investment by reducing uncertainty about currency movements and giving businesses access to deeper, more liquid financial markets.3 It can also reduce borrowing costs for countries with a history of high inflation and currency devaluation. By tying themselves to the mast of the monetary policy of others they can import credibility. This is exactly what the UK and other European countries aimed to do in joining the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Sharing a currency also helps promote integration. It does so by eliminating one of the barriers between markets, improving transparency of pricing and increasing competition. Sharing a currency can also help to increase the mobility of labour and capital, raise trade in goods and services, and improve the flow of technology and ideas.4 In these ways, members of a currency union can exploit more fully comparative advantage and ensure greater dynamic efficiency. Set against these benefits are the potentially large costs of giving up an independent monetary policy tailored to the needs of the region and a flexible exchange rate that can help absorb shocks. A flexible exchange rate acts as a valuable shock absorber when domestic wages and prices are sticky.5 For example, suppose demand for a country�s exports falls. All else equal, its output will fall, unemployment increase and current account deteriorate. With an independent currency, exchange rate depreciation can dampen these effects by improving competitiveness, and monetary policy can become more accommodative, supporting demand and employment. However, if the country were part of a currency area with its foreign market, its exchange rate would by definition not change, putting the full weight of adjustment on wages and unemployment � a significantly more protracted and painful process. In addition, the responsiveness of monetary policy to weak demand in that country would be diluted by the needs of the broader membership. Being in a currency union can amplify fiscal stress, and increase both the risks and consequences of financial instability. In the situation just described, fiscal policy would ideally help smooth adjustment to the external shock. But its ability to do so could be limited by the budgetary impact of the falls in output, prices and wages. To maintain credibility, fiscal policy    1     Mundell (1961). 2     Commission of the European Communities (1990). 3     The elimination of currency risk within the area reduces uncertainty over future prices for firms and consumers,     helping them to make better decisions about how much to produce, invest and consume. These benefits are     hard to quantify, but probably important. It also avoids inefficiencies that can arise when the exchange rate     fluctuates for non-fundamental reasons (Mundell 1973, Buiter 2000). 4     A substantial literature has sought to measure the impact of currency unions on trade flows, starting with Rose�s     (2000) surprising estimate that they are associated with a tripling in trade flows. Subsequent work suggests     smaller impacts. In relation to the Eurozone, a survey by Rose (2009) concludes that �EMU has raised trade     inside the Eurozone by at least 8% and perhaps 23%�. De Grauwe and Mongelli (2005) survey the broader ways     in which currency unions promote integration. 5     If wages and prices can adjust instantaneously then the adjustment to shocks can happen costlessly via     movements in prices and wages, so there is no cost to losing exchange rate flexibility.  2                                                                                         BIS central bankers� speeches may even become pro-cyclical, with the resulting austerity exacerbating the initial fall in demand. In the extreme, adverse fiscal dynamics could call into question a country�s membership of the union, creating the possibility of self-fulfilling �runs� on bank and sovereign debt absent central bank support.6 Such adverse feedback loops turned recessions into depressions in several European countries in recent years.  What makes a successful currency union? The success of a currency area hinges on whether its features mitigate the costs of losing the flexibility that comes from an independent monetary policy. These features generally promote the alignment of economic cycles, and the maintenance of price and financial stability within the union. The most obvious feature is the degree of similarity amongst members. Similar economies won�t suffer from a �one size fits all� monetary policy.7 Surprisingly, a review of major currency areas suggests that similarity is neither necessary nor sufficient for success. For example, the industrial structures of the core and periphery of the euro area are more similar than those of the constituents of Canada or the US (table 1). Yet few would argue that the euro area is the most effective currency union of the three. Conversely, the Canadian monetary union works well despite having substantially larger industrial variation than even the US.8 The similarity of the industrial structure of Scotland and the rest of the UK depends on how offshore oil is allocated. With oil split on a per capita basis Scotland and the rest of the UK look about as similar as the core and periphery of the euro area; but with oil split on a geographic basis they look about as diverse as the United States (table 1). Despite any differences, the close integration of the Scottish and rest of UK economies has helped ensure that their economic performance has been very similar over a long period � output growth is highly correlated (chart 1).9 So theory notwithstanding, being similar doesn�t necessarily help and being different doesn�t necessarily hinder. This suggests we should look elsewhere for the ingredients of a successful union: to the mobility of labour, capital and goods; to institutional structures promoting financial stability; and to institutions that mutualise risks and pool fiscal resources.  An economic union with free movement of labour, capital and goods The �five tests� formulated by the UK Government to analyse the merits of joining the euro in 2003 were crafted in large part around the degree of integration of the UK and the euro area.10 That is because greater openness and integration within a currency union not only enhances     6      These dynamics were in operation in the recent euro area crisis, until the announcement of the ECB�s Outright      Monetary Transactions. 7      Members are similar when they experience similar shocks and respond to the same shock in similar ways. That      reduces the likelihood of a shock affecting one part of the currency union, and hence reduces the need for the      exchange rate to adjust. Kenen (1969) argued that more diversified economies were better candidates to join      currency unions because industry-specific shocks were less likely to have macroeconomic effects, reducing the      need for exchange rate adjustment. 8      See Carney (2013). 9      Moreover unit labour costs in Scotland and the UK as a whole have moved closely together (chart 2), whereas      large relative movements in the Eurozone imply divergences in competitiveness (chart 3). 10      The five tests focused on the degree of convergence between the UK and the rest of Europe, the degree of      flexibility to adjust without moves in the exchange rate, and on whether joining would promote investment,      financial services, and growth, stability and employment (HM Treasury 2003).  BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                  3 the benefits of a shared currency but can also mitigate the cost of losing exchange rate flexibility.11 Mundell originally argued that currency areas should coincide with regions which had high internal factor mobility.12 The idea was that by moving from areas where demand has fallen to those where it has risen, workers help moderate changes in wages and unemployment.13 There are clear practical impediments to labour mobility within the euro area including language and culture. As a consequence, it has the lowest cross-border mobility of the five currency unions in table 2.14 This has contributed to the need for painful internal devaluation for some countries in the euro area to restore competitiveness. Given that more than 700,000 Scots live in the rest of the United Kingdom and over 500,000 from the rest of the UK live in Scotland, one would be tempted to assume that labour mobility between the two is high.15 In fact gross migration flows between Scotland and the rest of the UK are lower than in the constituent parts of some other currency areas (table 2). That probably in part reflects the fact that economic conditions in Scotland and the rest of the UK have been very similar, such that the incentive for migration is relatively limited. It is reasonable to think that the similarities between Scotland and the rest of the UK mean that there is the potential for higher labour mobility should that become necessary. Given differences in industrial structure, this would put a premium on ensuring barriers to mobility are not allowed to develop if monetary arrangements were to change. It is not just an integrated labour market that helps adjustment within a currency union. Openness to trade and free movement of goods also assists in diluting the effect of shocks by spreading them across the union. If one part of the union imports a large share of what it consumes from other parts, changes in demand will be quickly transmitted. This helps to align economic cycles and makes a common monetary policy more appropriate. 16, 17     11      The classic early contribution on this point was made by McKinnon (1963), who argued that the more open the      economy, the more flexible would be domestic prices and wages so that movements in the exchange rate would      have little impact on competitiveness, and would be less effective as a stabiliser. In that case moving to a fixed      exchange rate would be less costly. 12      Mundell (1961). 13      Some, including Bean (1992), have expressed scepticism that factors of production could in fact move over a      shorter timescale than that over which prices and wages adjust. 14      This is consistent with evidence that labour moves less in Europe in response to regional shocks than is the      case in the US � see Blanchard and Katz (1992) for the US, and Decressin and Fatas (1995) who apply the      same methodology to Europe. The latter find that participation reacts by more to a labour demand shock, and      migration by less in Europe than the US. 15      Office for National Statistics, 2011 Census. 16      Frankel and Rose (1998) found that countries with closer trade links tend to have more tightly correlated      business cycles. Since joining a currency area promotes trade integration, it also is also likely to help align      international business cycles. That means one of the key optimum currency area criteria is endogenous to the      decision to join. Rose�s (2009) more recent meta-analysis also finds a significant effect of trade on the      synchronisation of business cycles.      De Grauwe (2000) provides a discussion of how closer integration may affect the likelihood that countries      experience asymmetric shocks. On the one hand closer trade links could result in greater specialisation, leaving      currency union members more prone to asymmetric shocks. On the other, it could result in more intra-industry      trade, increasing the likelihood that countries will experience similar shocks, and thereby helping to align      business cycles. 17      A high degree of openness also means that the adjustment required to boost net exports is somewhat lower. A      much weaker adjustment in prices and wages is necessary to raise net exports by a given share of GDP if both      exports and imports are a large share of GDP than if they are a small share, Krugman (1992). However Adrian      and Gros (2004) observe that open economies are correspondingly more vulnerable to external shocks.  4                                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches Scotland and the rest of the UK are highly integrated. 70% of Scottish exports are destined for, and 74% of imports into Scotland come from, the rest of the UK (table 3). A word of caution applies here. There is a body of evidence that national borders can influence trade flows, even between otherwise highly integrated economies.18 The high degree of integration between Scotland and the rest of the UK may in part depend on their being part of the same sovereign nation. Mobility of capital can also promote necessary adjustment to shocks. Moreover, if capital in one part of a union is owned by those in other parts, the effect of a given shock is diluted across the union. Simply put, risks and rewards are shared. Similarly, the ability to borrow from other parts of the currency union in deep and liquid cross-union credit markets or integrated banking systems allows one part of a union to smooth out temporary falls in incomes.19 However, free movement of capital can be a mixed blessing. If the funds provided by one part of a union to another can be withdrawn easily, these outflows can � if the right structures are not in place � undermine financial and economic stability of all members. This brings me to the second feature of a successful currency union � banking union.  Banking union Effective currency unions need a wide range of institutions to support an integrated and efficient financial sector. These are often referred to as a �banking union� and include: �           Common supervisory standards, �           Access to central bank liquidity and lender of last resort facilities, �           Common resolution mechanisms, and �           A credible deposit guarantee scheme. Without a banking union, cross-border capital flows can be restricted, the effectiveness of monetary policy impaired and, in the extreme, the viability of the union itself undermined. It is as difficult to separate the institutions that support banking union from national fiscal arrangements as it is to separate the creditworthiness of banks and sovereigns. Let me explain. In recent years, doubts about the resilience of major financial institutions have created expectations of sovereign support. The scale of these potential liabilities can in turn generate doubts about public finances undermining the resilience of both banks and sovereigns. When such concerns emerge, the consequences can be dramatic. The banking systems of peripheral European countries experienced outflows of between 10% and 85% of total deposits from elsewhere in the euro area in the three years following June 2010 (chart 4). Bank funding spreads in those countries ballooned by 5 percentage points from the beginning of 2010 to the     18      Borders seem to matter. Trade between countries tends to be much more limited than trade within countries, as      shown for Canada and the US by McCallum (1995). There is also evidence for a border effect for financial      integration � there is more risk sharing through financial markets within countries than between countries (see      e.g. Crucini 1999). Rose and van Wincoop (2001) assess to what extent national currencies are a barrier to      trade, and find that trade barriers associated with national borders are halved when countries join a currency      union. 19      Mundell (1973). Asdrubali et al (1996) estimate that for the US risk-sharing in private markets is quantitatively      important in stabilising output at the state level.  BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                     5 middle of 2012 (chart 5). Bank lending to the real economy collapsed and credit conditions tightened massively (see charts 6�7).20, 21 Clearly something must be done. It is in the interests of all countries to sever the link between banks and sovereigns by ending too big to fail. Governments must put in place regimes that impose losses on bank management, shareholders and creditors rather than taxpayers. That is exactly what is established by the UK�s recent Banking Reform Act, and the recently agreed European Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive. The Bank of England is at the forefront of efforts to establish the common global requirement that is needed to finish the job. While ending too big to fail should mean that taxpayers no longer have to bail out banks, it will not fully break the bank-sovereign loop, for three reasons. First, banks hold substantial amounts of their national government�s debt in order to manage liquidity, meet collateral obligations and hedge exposures � European banks hold more than �1trn of home country sovereign debt amounting to 5% of total assets. Second, confidence in deposit guarantee schemes relies on a national backstop.22 The European process illustrates the difficulty of building the institutional arrangements for a common insurance scheme across sovereign states. This is unsurprising since mutualised deposit guarantee schemes imply a pooling of risk and loss of sovereignty. All member states must be persuaded that they won�t simply be left with the bill for the mistakes of others. Third, a currency union requires a common fiscal backstop for its central bank. Central banks must be able to act as Lender of Last Resort, both to financial institutions that are solvent but experiencing an unwarranted loss of confidence and to provide bridging finance to institutions that are being recapitalised using new resolution regimes. Under the current governance arrangements in the UK, these operations require an indemnity from, and the approval of, the Chancellor, because they would put substantial public funds at risk. The existing banking union between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has proved durable and efficient. Its foundations include a single prudential supervisor maintaining consistent standards of resilience, a single deposit guarantee scheme backed by the central government, and a common central bank, able to act as Lender of Last Resort across the union, and also backed by the central government. These arrangements help ensure that Scotland can sustain a banking system whose collective balance sheet is substantially larger than its GDP. The euro area has shown the dangers of not having such arrangements, as well as the difficulties of the necessary pooling of sovereignty to build them. An independent Scotland would need to consider carefully how to develop arrangements with the continuing United Kingdom that are both consistent with its sovereignty and sufficient to maintain financial stability.     20      That in turn contributed to the divergence in output growth between core and periphery (chart 8). In the UK the      share of mortgage lending in Scotland has been essentially flat through the crisis period (chart 9), suggesting      that there has been little if any divergence in credit conditions between the UK and Scotland. 21      This downward spiral of confidence can be most acute in countries with large banking sectors relative to their      economies � Iceland, Ireland and Cyprus all had banking sectors exceeding 600% of GDP in 2007 (table 4). In      the extreme, doubts about the sustainability of a nation�s membership of the currency union can only be relieved      by massive external support. 22      In theory these could be pre-funded. For small countries with large, concentrated banking systems, pre-funded      schemes are unlikely to be realistic in the short-term. Protected Scottish retail bank deposits are over 100% of      GDP, compared to around 50% for the rest of the UK. New European rules mandate deposit guarantee funds to      be built up only slowly over a decade and even then only to less than one per cent of insured deposits.  6                                                                                          BIS central bankers� speeches Fiscal arrangements While banking union requires common fiscal backing, there are two broader justifications for shared fiscal arrangements within a currency area. The first is that deeper fiscal integration between members can play an important role in smoothing shocks that affect only part of the currency area.23 It is no coincidence that effective currency unions tend to have centralised fiscal authorities whose spending is a sizeable share of GDP � averaging over a quarter of GDP for advanced countries outside the euro area (table 5). That offers scope for a significant degree of stabilisation, much of it happening automatically as slowing growth in one part of the union causes tax revenues there to fall and welfare spending to increase. Those automatic fiscal stabilisers are important within the UK � it is estimated that for every �1 that output falls the reduction in taxes and increases in transfers are together worth about 50 pence.24 What matters for individuals is the extent to which this risk sharing insulates their disposable income from shocks. In the UK there is evidence that around a fifth of variation in regional personal income relative to the national average is stabilised by central government transfers. That is probably an important factor in accounting for the close harmonisation of economic performance within the UK. The degree of stabilisation in France and the US is similar, with a slightly lower figure for Canada.25 Fiscal stabilisation is particularly important in a currency union because it helps mitigate the loss of exchange rate flexibility. But being in a currency union can amplify fiscal stress for individual nations, limiting their ability to perform this valuable role just when it is most needed. So it makes sense to share fiscal risks across the whole currency area. A localised shock is less likely to stretch the fiscal position in a larger more diversified currency area, especially if it shifts demand between different parts of the area. That makes a given shock to Nova Scotia less severe than the equivalent to Portugal. The second justification for shared fiscal arrangements is that problems in one country are very likely to spill over to others. For example, the threat of default by one country may trigger a generalised crisis, particularly if the liabilities of the crisis country are held by the banking system of the broader currency area. It will be in the interests of other countries in the union to bail out a country in crisis, and that reduces the incentives for countries to run their finances prudently in the first place. At a minimum, this �moral hazard� problem suggests the need for tight fiscal rules, to enforce prudent behaviour for all in the union, although credible sanctions for breaking those rules are hard to develop.26 There is an obvious tension between using robust fiscal rules to solve this problem, and allowing national fiscal policy to act as a shock absorber. This reinforces the need for fiscal risk sharing between nations. As the Presidents of the European Council, European Commission, Eurogroup and European Central Bank argued in their report, European monetary union, which has so far relied on fiscal rules, will not be complete until it builds mechanisms to share fiscal sovereignty.27 Possible   23      Kenen (1969). 24      This refers to a fall in output relative to potential output. See Chamberlin et al (2013). 25      These estimates are reported in Melitz and Zumer (2002). 26      The Delors Committee (1989) report, which provided the foundation for monetary union in Europe, recognised      that market discipline would not be sufficient to ensure that participating countries followed sound fiscal policies,      and that fiscal constraints would therefore be required. Beetsma and Uhlig (1999) provide a formal motivation for      the resulting stability and growth pact as a device to internalise the costs of inflation that might otherwise result      from imprudent fiscal policies. See also Chari and Kehoe (2007). Recent experience demonstrates that over-      indebtedness can also have costly spillovers through financial crises. 27      See Barroso et al (2012).  BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                         7 options range from a transfer union to a pooled employment insurance mechanism. Whatever is ultimately chosen, the degree of fiscal risk sharing will likely have to be significant. Similarly, in a monetary union between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK the two Parliaments would have to agree on whether fiscal rules were sufficient or whether similar risk- sharing mechanisms were necessary.  Conclusion The Scottish government has stated that in the event of independence it would seek to retain sterling as part of a formal currency union. All aspects of any such arrangement would be a matter for the Scottish and UK Parliaments. If such deliberations ever were to happen, they would need to consider carefully what the economics of currency unions suggest are the necessary foundations for a durable union, particularly given the clear risks if these foundations are not in place. Those risks have been demonstrated clearly in the euro area over recent years, with sovereign debt crises, financial fragmentation and large divergences in economic performance. The euro area is now beginning to rectify its institutional shortcomings, but further, very significant steps must be taken to expand the sharing of risks and pooling of fiscal resources. In short, a durable, successful currency union requires some ceding of national sovereignty. It is likely that similar institutional arrangements would be necessary to support a monetary union between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK. I suspect you have reached your limits of endurance of the dismal science, so you�ll be relieved to know that economics can take us no further. Decisions that cede sovereignty and limit autonomy are rightly choices for elected governments and involve considerations beyond mere economics. For those considerations, others are better placed to comment.     8                                                                            BIS central bankers� speeches References Adrian, T., and D.

Promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom Text of the 30th Mais Lecture by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at Cass Business School, City University, London, 18 March 2014.                                                             *      *     *  It is a great honour to be invited to give the 30th Mais Lecture. This lecture series has charted the evolution of UK macroeconomic policy through the eyes of leading policymakers, including my four predecessors as Governor. The Mais Lectures span a period during which the focus of macroeconomic management was firmly on monetary policy. They helped establish a broad consensus for the primacy of price stability as well as the institutional framework necessary to deliver it. This focus initially made sense since one of the greatest challenges for macroeconomic policy in the late 1970s and 1980s was the fight against inflation.1 That fight culminated in the adoption of an inflation target, which helped secure 15 years of price stability and sustained economic growth. However, with time, a healthy focus became a dangerous distraction. The financial crisis that exploded the Great Moderation was a powerful reminder that price stability is not sufficient to maintain macroeconomic stability. Words which had alluded to such risks were not followed by actions that might have prevented them being realised. Lessons have since been learned. In the wake of the crisis, the Bank of England would be promised enormous new powers and responsibilities. In the past year those promises have become realities with the statutory Financial Policy Committee (FPC) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) formally joining the Bank. The question now is how we use our powers to fulfil our responsibilities. In response, the Bank of England is today launching a transformative strategic plan to fulfil its broader mission. We have a new leadership team. We are setting out fifteen initiatives to reshape the institution. Behind that plan is a vision for the Bank that I want to set out this evening. It is: A Bank with many and varied responsibilities, but a single timeless mission; An institution that works as One Bank to exploit the synergies and complementarities across our policy functions; A Bank that draws on its long history of intellectual leadership and international engagement to shape an open, resilient global system; And a Bank that builds on the immense successes of the past quarter century in combining clear objectives, good governance and constructive transparency.  A single timeless mission Let me begin by asking a simple question: what is the Bank of England for? The Bank�s founding charter of 1694 explains that its original purpose was to �promote the publick Good and Benefit of our People��. What that meant in practice at the time was    1     �The fight against inflation� was the title of Geoffrey Howe�s 1981 lecture.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  1 pithily summarised by the diarist John Evelyn, who recorded the event 320 years ago in the following terms: �A publick bank... set up by Act of Parliament� for money to carry on the war�. The war in question was against France, and in return for the monies raised the Bank received both income and banking privileges: it was soon the only bank allowed to be constituted as a joint stock company, and had an effective monopoly of the note issue in the London area.2 Its size � partly resulting from its unique joint stock status � meant that, by the first half of the 19th Century, the Bank had become the dominant part of the financial infrastructure. Its notes had become an accepted means of settlement between banks, and as the provider of those notes the Bank acted as banker to other banks. Commercial banks held Bank of England notes in place of gold, relying on the Bank of England�s credibility for ultimate convertibility. Despite the Bank�s founding aim of public service, criticism persisted until after the middle of the 19th Century that it was acting in its own rather than the public interest by protecting its gold reserves at times of financial stress, to the detriment of its customers. That criticism faded as the Bank gradually assumed the role of lender of last resort, adopting Bagehot�s principle that it should lend freely against good collateral at penalty rates in times of crisis.3 By the end of the 19th Century the Bank of England had informal responsibility for a broad range of policy areas. It remained the fiscal agent for the government. It maintained monetary stability through the operation of the Gold Standard. And it promoted financial stability through its role as the effective lender of last resort, and more generally � through the judicious exercise of the Governor�s eyebrows � as the institution which managed and resolved financial crises.4 While the Bank�s responsibilities varied over the following century they remained broad and largely informal until 1997. The transformative changes that year gave birth to a modern Bank with a narrower focus on price stability grounded in clear statutory objectives, and with the operational independence to pursue them. Independence was the solution to the time inconsistency problem, which causes policymakers who promise low inflation � but then go for faster growth � to get neither. Removing political considerations from the conduct of monetary policy made possible a credible commitment to low inflation. Strong accountability mechanisms and transparency were put in place to legitimise that independence. Those changes reflected the belief that price stability was the best contribution a central bank could make to macroeconomic stability and by extension to the broader public good. This represented a deconstruction of the old model of central banking.5 In my view, while there were enormous innovations of enduring value during this period, the reductionist vision of a central bank�s role that was adopted around the world was fatally flawed.     2     Other banks were restricted to partnerships of up to 6 members. 3     During the 1866 and 1878 crises the Bank lent freely to the system but allowed the insolvent Overend Gurney     and City of Glasgow Bank to fail. And in 1890 it used a �lifeboat� approach to rescue Barings which was     perceived to be solvent. Note however that there is no definitive evidence that an explicit set of Lender of Last     Report (LOLR) principles was accepted by the top of the Bank and its directors. The emergence of the Bank�s     LOLR role in this period is discussed in Collins (1988), Capie (2002) and Dornbusch and Frenkel (1984). 4     In the late 19th Century the banking system was relatively unregulated (and partly self-regulated) � the Bank     did not have an explicit supervisory infrastructure or system of prudential control until 1979. Nevertheless the     scope of the Bank�s responsibilities was arguably as broad then as it is now, albeit that the mix was different. 5     See Padoa-Schioppa (2011).    2                                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches In particular, it failed to recognise that financial stability is as important an objective of macroeconomic policy as price stability, and it downplayed the interrelationships between the two. And it failed to recognise that central banks have a vital role to play in maintaining financial stability because of the deep underlying connection between it and monetary stability. Both are fundamentally about maintaining the public trust and confidence in money and financial intermediation that are essential for them to oil the wheels of commerce. That trust and confidence can be undermined through a loss of certainty about the future value of money, a loss of confidence in financial intermediaries, or ultimately a loss of faith in the financial system. Central banks have a primordial responsibility to act as guarantors of trust and confidence in money because of their status as monopoly issuers of currency. This naturally gives them control over the quantity of money and interest rates � monetary policy. It also means that a core part of financial stability policy � acting as lender of last resort to private financial institutions at times of financial stress � falls naturally to central banks. Other instruments of financial stability policy seek to prevent the build-up of vulnerabilities in the first place. Microprudential supervision aims to maintain the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions by ensuring they are adequately capitalised and have sufficiently resilient funding and liquidity. Macroprudential policy seeks to safeguard the stability and resilience of the financial system as a whole both by using prudential policy for macroeconomic ends � for example in managing the financial cycle � and by addressing risks related to structural features of financial institutions and markets. In the latter regard, the priorities range from ending too big to fail to improving the resilience of financial market infrastructure. The Bank of England has now been tasked by Parliament with operating these prudential tools. Our broad range of responsibilities now include: supervision and regulation of financial market infrastructures; acting as lender and market maker of last resort; the design and operation of macroprudential tools; recommendations on core elements of financial reform; and the resolution of failing financial institutions. A return to a broad role is welcome. The best answer to the question of what the Bank of England is for is given by the original 1694 founding charter: promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom. That mission is timeless. The understanding of what we should do to achieve it has evolved. In 1694 promoting the good of the people meant financing a war with France. During the Great Moderation, it meant price stability. Today, reflecting the lessons of the ensuing financial crisis, it means maintaining both monetary and financial stability. We don�t intend to fail. Going back 320 years to refresh our purpose is part of building on the best of our history, but we are not seeking to reconstruct the central bank of the past. Instead through our strategic plan we are building the 21st Century central bank. Here�s how.  One Bank: complementarities, synergies and economies of scope The broad range of responsibilities we have been given creates the potential to exploit the complementarities and synergies between them. It is our duty to do so because the effectiveness of each function influences that of the others. In other words, we have to maximise our impact by working together.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                   3 That imperative is the core of our new strategic plan which stresses that our contribution to the public good will be greatest if we work as One Bank. Complementarities might be operational, arising when putting two functions together is more efficient by allowing faster decision making in a crisis, improving the coherence of communication, or taking advantage of the common skills, information or analyses required to operate the policies.6 Or they might be economic, arising when there are strong interactions in the way the policies have their effect, or when one policy affects another. It then makes more sense to have them operated by one institution so that shared analysis and information leads to consistency of decision making and so that trade-offs between objectives can be managed effectively, and in a timely manner, to achieve better outcomes. There are strong complementarities between all four of the core functions of the Bank: monetary policy, markets, macroprudential policy and microprudential regulation.7 Each affects overall monetary and financial conditions and therefore has the capacity to affect the achievement of both monetary and financial stability. They in turn help maintain confidence in the currency, which we also support by issuing high-quality banknotes that people can use with confidence. More generally we are conscious that everything we do affects the trust and confidence in the Bank and by extension the financial system.  Monetary and macroprudential policy The interaction between macroprudential and monetary policy is central to the Bank�s success in achieving its dual objectives of monetary and financial stability. The case for discharging these responsibilities in a coordinated way is very strong. I am delighted that Ben Broadbent has today been appointed as the next Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy. In that role, he will be central to co-ordinating these functions and his experience in academia, financial markets, and as an external Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) member, makes him extremely well qualified to do so. The transmission channels of monetary and prudential policy overlap, particularly in their impact on banks� balance sheets and credit supply and demand � and hence the wider economy.8 Monetary policy affects the resilience of the financial system, and macroprudential policy tools that affect leverage influence credit growth and the wider economy. In turn, financial stability is a pre-requisite for monetary stability � for example systemic banking crises are likely to be deflationary. In reducing the frequency and severity of financial crises, macroprudential policy therefore helps to preserve the role of money as a store of value.9 While price and financial stability are clearly connected, achieving both can be difficult. As we saw so clearly in the run-up to the financial crisis, the credit and business cycles operate on different time horizons, with the former as much as twice as long and twice as big.10 In   6      Decision-making should be quicker with fewer agencies involved, and when trade-offs can be internalised      rather than being subject to negotiation. 7      Blinder (2010) argues that, because of economies of scope, the Federal Reserve should be both the systemic      risk regulator and should supervise because preserving financial stability is closely aligned with the objectives      of monetary policy and is likely to require lender of last resort powers. 8      Monetary policy affects banks� balance sheets for example by changing the return on their assets; through its      impact on the economic cycle and the amount of bad loans; through its impact on credit demand; and by      affecting the value of their collateral and hence funding conditions. 9      Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2013). 10      See Aikman et al (2014), Drehman et al (2012).    4                                                                                            BIS central bankers� speeches pursuing price stability, monetary policy can contribute to the gradual build-up of financial vulnerabilities through its effect on the degree of risk-taking in the economy.11 For example the period of low and predictable interest rates before the financial crisis helped drive a �search for yield� and leverage cycle, even with inflation subdued. It doesn�t take a genius to see that similar risks exist today. That tension between monetary and financial stability is best managed in a coordinated way in a single institution. The use of macroprudential tools can decrease the need for monetary policy to be diverted from managing the business cycle towards managing the credit cycle. This enhances the credibility of the inflation target. That in turn may reduce the need for sharp or persistent moves in interest rates, which themselves might threaten financial stability. Similarly, macroprudential policy can more effectively focus on its primary goal of systemic stability by recognising that, while it affects the economic cycle, it is not suited to managing it. Instead its effects on the economic cycle should � like fiscal policy � be taken into account in setting monetary policy, which is the primary and most effective tool of demand management. Taken together with the synergies from sharing information and analysis, these are strong arguments for operating monetary policy and prudential policy in the same institution. In the short time the Bank has been responsible for both, we have already seen the benefits of operating them in a coordinated way. For example, our forward guidance framework for monetary policy reflects a clear division of responsibilities. Although monetary policy has an important role to play in mitigating financial stability risks, it does so only as a last line of defence. This is important because vulnerabilities can emerge from a long period of unusually low interest rates, as complacency sets in about the future path of policy and asset prices. There have been signs of such behaviour across the housing markets in advanced economies. In anticipation of similar risks arising in the UK the Bank�s MPC and FPC have met jointly to review them. The FPC has identified a graduated range of macroprudential tools available to it for a coherent, proportionate response to these risks, and has taken initial, prudent steps. As the housing market evolves and macroprudential policy responds the FPC and MPC will continue to work together to understand the collective impact of measures on residual vulnerabilities and macroeconomic outcomes. That co-ordination, the shared monitoring of risks, and clarity over the FPC�s tools allows monetary policy to keep Bank Rate as low as necessary for as long as appropriate in order to support the recovery and maintain price stability. For example expectations of the future path of interest rates � and hence longer-term borrowing costs � have not risen as the housing market has begun to recover quickly.  Macroprudential and microprudential policy There is also a natural complementarity between macro and microprudential policy because, in essence, macroprudential policy uses prudential policy tools for macroeconomic ends, specifically the mitigation of risks that could in time undermine price and financial stability. 12 So the two will often operate through the same channels � albeit towards different objectives.    11      See Adrian and Shin (2010), Jimenez et al. (forthcoming). 12      For example, the Basel III framework for capital regulation combines microprudential and macroprudential      elements. Tougher minimum requirements and institution-specific add-ons will be the responsibility of      microprudential supervision. The system-wide counter-cyclical buffer will be the responsibility of      macroprudential policy.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                              5 Those objectives are themselves generally mutually reinforcing. While ensuring the safety and soundness of individual institutions is not sufficient for systemic stability, it surely helps.13 Meanwhile macroprudential policy seeks to reduce systemic risks and in doing so is likely to improve the resilience of individual firms.14 At times there may be a conflict. This is most likely to arise at a turning point in the cycle when macroprudential policy � perhaps in pursuit of its secondary objective to support growth and employment � may mandate a loosening of capital requirements in order to support credit supply and broader economic conditions. A microprudential supervisor at the same time may understandably be more concerned to maintain large capital buffers. The question best answered in a single institution is which dominates � risks from a paradox of thrift or those from weakened institutions? The obvious overlaps in tools and objectives mean that combining the two arms of prudential policy in one organisation makes sense. That will also help to share knowledge and expertise, and to help avoid conflicting messages to firms. And, to the extent conflicts occur, they are likely to best be resolved within a single institution through shared analysis and mutual understanding of reaction functions.15 Our strategy will be to conduct supervision as an integrated part of the central bank and not as a standalone supervisory agency that happens to be attached to a central bank. The benefits that close cooperation can bring were demonstrated in 2013 as the PRA and the FPC worked closely together to bring clarity both to banks� existing capital positions, and the standards expected of them. The FPC mandated the exercise with a view to establishing a system-wide, transparent standard of resilience that would boost confidence and allow the banking system to contribute to economic recovery. The PRA � under Andrew Bailey�s leadership � delivered the recommendation for each of the major institutions. The resulting increase in capital ensured the core of the financial system was on a sound footing and made an important contribution to securing economic recovery. There were clearly lessons to learn from that exercise, most notably the importance of clarity of early communication by the Bank to financial institutions about the standards to which they would be held. Those lessons are being applied now in the first of the Bank�s annual stress- testing exercises, which will bring together the microprudential standards for banks with a macroprudential assessment of the risks to which they must be resilient. As with monetary policy, expectations matter and the system will be more resilient if the Bank�s moves can be anticipated.  Market operations and prudential policy The synergies I have identified so far explain why it makes sense for monetary policy and prudential policies to be operated by a single institution, but there are also complementarities between prudential policy and the way a central bank uses its balance sheet and controls the supply of high-powered money.     13      In a concentrated banking system such as the UK�s the resilience of a subset of large institutions has a      disproportionate effect on the resilience of the system. One might think that microprudential regulation is then      enough to guarantee systemic stability. But that is not so when there are systemic externalities or financial      accelerator effects. The latter operate through feedbacks in the macroeconomy, and would depend (among      other things) in the short run on the response of monetary policy. A macroprudential authority � with a      macroeconomic viewpoint � therefore complements microprudential supervision even in a concentrated      banking system. 14      See Bank of England (2009) for a discussion. 15      Blinder (2010) makes this argument in the context of potential conflicts between safety and soundness      considerations and monetary policy.   6                                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches The design and operation of our liquidity facilities have important synergies with prudential policy. The terms on which we supply liquidity in times of stress affects the level of self- insurance banks choose. If we are too strict, banks have to over-insure at significant cost by holding an excess of low-yielding liquid assets rather than loans, and markets will freeze too quickly in crises. But overly permissive terms create a moral hazard risk in the form of banks running excessive liquidity mismatches in normal times.16 Prudential supervisors can mitigate the moral hazard risk by imposing minimum liquidity requirements. But there is no point in setting those requirements at a very high level when the central bank is prepared to lend freely against good collateral to solvent institutions. So it is important to coordinate liquidity requirements and banks� reliance on liquidity insurance from the Bank of England. Striking an efficient balance is most likely when responsibility for prudential policy also lies with the central bank.17 And it explains why we are announcing management changes today to enhance that coordination, with Paul Fisher � the Bank�s Executive Director for Markets � moving to become Deputy Head of the PRA. The Bank exploited those synergies in August 2013 when, recognising the greater availability of liquidity insurance provided through our facilities, and banks� improved capitalisation, we reduced the required level of banks� liquid asset holdings to help support lending to the real economy. And in October last year we overhauled our facilities, offering money and collateral for longer terms against a wider range of assets, at lower cost. We could do so because, as both supervisor and provider of liquidity insurance, we can manage any resulting moral hazard risk.18 More importantly these changes recognise and support the evolution of markets and the growing importance of collateral that in turn stems from financial reform. We have the opportunity through the design of our facilities to help support more diverse forms of finance and more resilient markets � to the benefit of financial stability. There is another important operational complementarity. The Bank can use supervisory information and insight to make quicker, better informed judgements about whether to lend to banks at times of crisis.19 It is clear that there is a strong case for central banks to have a broad role. Monetary and financial stability are core objectives of macroeconomic policy, and central banks are uniquely well positioned to contribute to their achievement. There are significant complementarities between the broad range of the Bank�s policy responsibilities, and that has already translated into significant mutually reinforcing support to the UK economic recovery. Our strategic plan cements our commitment to work as One Bank to exploit those synergies. It breaks down barriers between areas within the Bank through a reorganisation that puts greater emphasis on joint working and moves key senior staff between areas; it aids staff movement between areas by promoting a unified culture; it sweeps away a proliferation of internal committees that held up decision-making; and it gives responsibility to the new Chief Economist and Governors both for a coordinated research agenda spanning all aspects of central banking and focusing in particular on the intersections between policy areas, and for ensuring the Bank makes better use of the data we have across the organisation in tackling all of the policy challenges we face.     16      See Farhi and Tirole (2012). 17      See Rochet and Vives (2004). 18      See http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/Documents/money/publications/liquidityinsurance.pdf. 19      See Ferguson (1999).    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                          7 International engagement to shape an open global system In an era of renewed globalisation securing monetary and financial stability requires more than a purely domestic focus. To realise globalisation�s promise and deliver strong, sustainable and balanced growth, policymakers must re-build an open, integrated and resilient global financial system. As the leading global financial centre, the UK will be central to this task. There are two elements that are particularly important. First, the Bank of England�s actions will help shape the functioning of core markets. The combination of the eventual exit from Quantitative Easing and new liquidity regulations will shape demand for central bank reserves. A host of financial reforms, such as those to derivative markets, will fundamentally change the role of collateral, to which the Bank of England�s facilities must respond. And most fundamentally, given the serious issues raised by the Libor and foreign exchange scandals, changes must be made to both the hard and soft infrastructure of core markets to ensure they are fair, effective and efficient. These are massive issues which require focus, discipline and innovation. Those are some of the reasons why we have created a new Deputy Governor role for Markets and Banking and why my colleagues and I are thrilled that Minouche Shafik has accepted this extraordinarily important task. Minouche brings immense international, managerial and economic experience from a career that has spanned academia, the public service and the IMF. She will help lead the Bank�s efforts to reshape core markets and the Bank�s relationship to them. Second, through its intellectual leadership and international relationships, the Bank can help complete the G20�s ambitious programme of financial reform including building resilient financial institutions, ending too big to fail, making derivative markets safer and transforming shadow banking to market based finance. Sir Jon Cunliffe, one of the original architects of the Financial Stability Board, is leading this effort. The job is too big for one person and requires a well-resourced and focused international strategy that draws on all areas of the Bank. That is why we are pooling our prudential policy teams in a single directorate and bringing together our international teams to increase insight and impact. By acting as One Bank we can increase our international impact and ensure that the UK�s financial sector can be both a global good and a national asset.  Building on the success of the past 25 years On the face of it the recent enlargement in the Bank�s responsibilities represents a return to the broader role of the Bank of the past. If there are some similarities in roles, how we will discharge them will be fundamentally different. The age of informal responsibilities, nods, winks, secrecy and instinct is long past.20 In no small part due to the Mais Lectures of my predecessors, particularly Mervyn King, we have today a regime for monetary policy that is both democratically legitimate and highly effective. It rests on clear ultimate objectives delegated by Parliament, on sound governance arrangements to support independence, and on transparency of policymaking. We are extending this sound framework with our strategic plan. We will reinforce these foundations in monetary policy. And we will broaden them to financial stability. The case for the independent operation of monetary policy is firmly established around the time-inconsistency of governments with horizons dictated by the electoral cycle. That time- inconsistency argument applies even more strongly to both microprudential and macroprudential policy given the large potential size and long duration of credit cycles. The   20      That approach is perhaps best captured by Montagu Norman�s remark in 1930 when pressed by the      Macmillan Committee to explain the Bank�s actions: �Reasons, Mr Chairman? I don�t have reasons, I have      instincts�.    8                                                                                    BIS central bankers� speeches avoidance of potentially unpopular measures to boost the resilience of the financial system today can have disastrous consequences many years later. Moreover, being tough and avoiding crises has no obvious reward. It is hard to be given credit for a counterfactual. The Bank�s independence must be supported by good governance arrangements. Now that Parliament has developed them, we must make them work. The model used for monetary policy of decisions being made by a committee made up of both Bank of England executives and independent experts has been expanded to financial stability with the creation of both a Financial Policy Committee and a Board of Prudential Regulation. As I have argued, those policy committees will be more effective if they have access to the broadest range of the Bank�s analysis and information and are as well informed as possible about each other�s reaction function. The now very wide range of the Bank�s responsibilities also creates a need to strengthen the oversight arrangements for the Bank as a whole. For delivery of our statutory objectives, the Bank is accountable to the public, through Parliament�s Treasury Committee. That accountability is being reinforced. Parliament has created an Oversight Committee of 8 non-executives who are in the Bank but not of the Bank. The Government has today announced the appointment of Anthony Habgood to lead the Bank�s Court of Directors and the Oversight Committee. I welcome the appointment of someone of his depth and breadth of corporate experience. Independent oversight by the committee he will chair can strengthen the Bank�s legitimacy and effectiveness. The Oversight Committee has access to internal papers, is able"
2014-05-28	"Mark Carney: Inclusive capitalism � creating a sense of the systemic Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Conference on Inclusive Capitalism, London, 27 May 2014.                                                    *     *     *  Introduction Inclusive capitalism is fundamentally about delivering a basic social contract comprised of relative equality of outcomes; equality of opportunity; and fairness across generations. Different societies will place different weights on these elements but few would omit any of them. Societies aspire to this trinity of distributive justice, social equity and intergenerational equity for at least three reasons. First, there is growing evidence that relative equality is good for growth. 1 At a minimum, few would disagree that a society that provides opportunity to all of its citizens is more likely to thrive than one which favours an elite, however defined. Second, research suggests that inequality is one of the most important determinants of relative happiness and that a sense of community � itself a form of inclusion � is a critical determinant of well-being. 2 Third, they appeal to a fundamental sense of justice. 3 Who behind a Rawlsian veil of ignorance � not knowing their future talents and circumstances � wouldn�t want to maximise the welfare of the least well off?  The problem: the growing exclusivity of capitalism This gathering and similar ones in recent years have been prompted by a sense that this basic social contract is breaking down. That unease is backed up by hard data. At a global level, there has been convergence of opportunities and outcomes, but this is only because the gap between advanced and emerging economies has narrowed. Within societies, virtually without exception, inequality of outcomes both within and across generations has demonstrably increased. 4 The big drivers of globalisation and technology are magnifying market distributions. 5 Moreover, returns in a globalised world are amplifying the rewards of the superstar and, though few of them would be inclined to admit it, the lucky. 6     1     See Ostry, Berg and Tsangarides (2014). 2     See Alesina, Di Tella and MacCulloch (2004); Wilkinson and Pickett (2009). 3     In 31 of the 39 countries surveyed by Pew Research in 2013, half or more of the population believed inequality     to be a �very big problem� in their societies (Pew Research Center, 2013). 4     The Gini coefficient pertaining to household disposable income rose from 0.26 in 1961 to 0.36 in 2008 in the     UK, and from 0.39 to 0.46 over the same period in the US, according to data collected by Atkinson and Morelli     (2014). Those data show this to be a common pattern across many advanced economies. In emerging     markets, Gini coefficients remain high relative to the average for OECD countries, and rose between the     1990s and 2000s for India, China and the Russian Federation, though falling for Brazil (OECD, 2011a). The     share of income received by the top 1 per cent of the population has also risen since the 1980s across many     industrialised countries, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States (Atkinson and     Morelli, 2014). 5     See Autor, Katz and Krueger (1998) and Autor, Katz and Kearney (2008). For example the last 60 years have     seen US returns to education rise despite a large increase in the supply of more educated workers. And there     is evidence that increases in the employment of more skilled workers between the 1970s and the 1990s were     greater in more computer intensive industries.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                   1 Now is the time to be famous or fortunate. There is also disturbing evidence that equality of opportunity has fallen, with the potential to reinforce cultural and economic divides. For example, social mobility has declined in the US undercutting the sense of fairness at the heart of American society. 7 Intergenerational equity is similarly strained across the advanced world. Social welfare systems designed and enjoyed by previous generations may prove, absent reform, unaffordable for future ones. 8 And environmental degradation remains unaddressed, a tragic embarrassment now seldom mentioned in either polite society or at the G20. To maintain the balance of an inclusive social contract, it is necessary to recognise the importance of values and beliefs in economic life. Economic and political philosophers from Adam Smith (1759) to Hayek (1960) have long recognised that beliefs are part of inherited social capital, which provides the social framework for the free market. Social capital refers to the links, shared values and beliefs in a society which encourage individuals not only to take responsibility for themselves and their families but also to trust each other and work collaboratively to support each other. 9 So what values and beliefs are the foundations of inclusive capitalism? 10 Clearly to succeed in the global economy, dynamism is essential. To align incentives across generations, a long-term perspective is required. For markets to sustain their legitimacy, they need to be not only effective but also fair. Nowhere is that need more acute than in financial markets; finance has to be trusted. And to value others demands engaged citizens who recognise their obligations to each other. In short, there needs to be a sense of society.  Social capital has been eroded These beliefs and values are not necessarily fixed; they need to be nurtured. My core point is that, just as any revolution eats its children, unchecked market fundamentalism can devour the social capital essential for the long-term dynamism of capitalism itself. To counteract this tendency, individuals and their firms must have a sense of their responsibilities for the broader system. All ideologies are prone to extremes. Capitalism loses its sense of moderation when the belief in the power of the market enters the realm of faith. In the decades prior to the crisis, such radicalism came to dominate economic ideas and became a pattern of social     6      As Michael Lewis has remarked, �Success is always rationalized. People really don�t like to hear success      explained away as luck � especially successful people. Lucky [to] live in the richest society the world has ever      seen, in a time when no one actually expects you to sacrifice your interests to anything.� Lewis (2012). 7      See for example Corak (2013), who finds that the elasticity of a son�s adult earnings with respect to his      parents� earnings � the �intergenerational elasticity� � rose from 0.3 to around 0.55 between 1950 and 2000 in      the US, indicative of a decline in social mobility. Corak has also shown that the intergenerational earnings      elasticity tends to be higher in more unequal countries; a phenomenon termed the �Great Gatsby Curve� by      Alan Krueger (2012). 8      Government spending has increased in most countries around the world since the 1960s, reflecting increased      spending on social protection, education and healthcare (IMF, 2014). And, looking forward, all OECD      countries face increased budgetary pressure due to expected increases in age-related healthcare, long-term      care and pensions (OECD, 2011b, Table 1.1). Merola and Sutherland (2012) analyse long-run fiscal      sustainability in the context of these budgetary pressures. 9      E.g. Putnam (2001). 10      For a similar list see Shanmugaratnam (2013).    2                                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches behaviour. 11 As Michael Sandel argued, we moved from a market economy to a market society. 12 Market fundamentalism � in the form of light-touch regulation, the belief that bubbles cannot be identified and that markets always clear � contributed directly to the financial crisis and the associated erosion of social capital. Ensuing events have further strained trust in the financial system. Many supposedly rugged markets were revealed to be cosseted: �           major banks were too-big-to fail: operating in a privileged heads-I-win-tails-you-lose             bubble; �           there was widespread rigging of benchmarks for personal gain; and �           equity markets demonstrated a perverse sense of fairness, blatantly favouring the             technologically empowered over the retail investor. 13 Such practices widen the gap between insider and outsider returns and challenge distributive justice. More fundamentally, the resulting mistrust in market mechanisms reduces both happiness and social capital. We simply cannot take the capitalist system, which produces such plenty and so many solutions, for granted. Prosperity requires not just investment in economic capital, but investment in social capital. It is necessary to rebuild social capital to make markets work. This is not an abstract issue or a naive aspiration. I will argue that we have already made a start with financial reform and that by completing the job, by returning to true markets, we can make capitalism more inclusive.  What then must be done? There are a wide range of policies to promote inclusive capitalism from early childhood education, training and the importance of differentiated pathways and mixed-income neighbourhoods. These are all fundamentally political issues. As an economist who should know the importance of comparative advantage, I will spend the balance of my time focusing on what central banks can do to support inclusive capitalism. The Bank of England�s mission �to promote the good of the people of the UK by maintaining monetary and financial stability� suggests that central banks have an important role to play in supporting social welfare. Central banks can contribute in two areas. First, our core macroeconomic objectives promote social welfare. Second, we can help to create an environment in which financial market participants are encouraged to think of their roles as part of a broader system. By building a sense of responsibility for the system, individuals will act in ways that reinforce the bonds of social capital and inclusive capitalism. Some of this is straightforward. Inflation hurts the poor the most and the real costs of financial instability � unemployment and the seizure of credit � are likely to be felt most     11      Padoa-Schioppa (2010). 12      Sandel (2012). 13      See Martin (2012), also Lewis (2014).    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                   3 acutely by the poor. 14 Conversely monetary and financial stability are cornerstones of strong, sustainable and balanced growth and therefore directly affect distributive justice. Some is more nuanced. While to not have acted would have been catastrophic for all, the distributional consequences of the response to the financial crisis have been significant. Extraordinary monetary stimulus � both conventional, through low short-term interest rates, and unconventional, through large scale purchases of assets � raised a range of asset prices, benefiting their owners, and lowered yields, benefiting borrowers at the expense of savers. 15 Central banks are not blind to these issues. Rather we recognise that decisions to redistribute wealth are rightly political, as are most policies that promote social mobility. It is only in extreme circumstances, such as in the wake of a financial crisis, that we can have some limited influence on social mobility and intergenerational equity. That is because the depth and duration of recessions can profoundly affect the opportunities over the rest of the lives of affected workers. For example, a rise in unemployment by 5 percentage points is estimated to imply an average initial loss of earnings for new college graduates of around 9 per cent, an effect which is estimated to fade only after a decade. 16 The persistent effects from adverse labour market conditions are much larger for individuals in the first year of their careers than for those with a few years of experience. And losses are magnified for those whose earnings are predicted to be lower, based on their college major. The current situation in many advanced economies is very challenging: over 40% of recent graduates in US are underemployed 17 and youth unemployment is around 50% in the worst affected countries in the Euro area. With clear risks of a misplaced if not lost generation, to the extent appropriate under our mandates, the monetary policy response has represented a race against long-term (or hysteretic) unemployment. As Janet Yellen remarked, �the risk that continued high unemployment could eventually lead to more-persistent structural problems underscores the case for maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.� 18 In Britain at least, these risks have been sharply reduced. The Bank of England has used a range of policies first to stimulate and then to secure the recovery. These have helped support the strongest job growth on record including record-high transitions back into employment by the longer-term unemployed. Longer-term social mobility will benefit from this track record. Looking ahead, improvements in policy frameworks should help to reduce � but not eliminate � the incidence of financial crises. A core lesson of the recent episode is the need to think of    14      For example, using data on over 30,000 households in 38 countries, Easterly and Fischer (2001) find that the      poor are more likely than the rich to mention inflation as a top national concern. Moreover, higher inflation is      associated with greater income inequality in cross-country data (Albanesi, 2007). Financial crises in      developing countries are associated with an increase in poverty and, in some cases, income inequality � see      for example Baldacci, de Mello and Inchauste (2002). OECD (2013) documents an increase in market income      inequality over the period 2007�2010 across developed countries, and reports with respect to the top and      bottom 10% of the income distribution that �lower income households either lost more from income falls or      benefitted less from the often sluggish recovery.� In general it is likely that adverse income and employment      shocks hurt the poor the most, for example because they lack the ability to hedge against these shocks and      may lack access to credit markets to smooth them. Even if crises have a neutral effect on income inequality,      the poor are much less able to absorb a cut in income (Honohan 2005). 15      For an assessment of the distributional effects of the Bank of England�s asset purchases, see      http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/news/2012/nr073.pdf. 16      See Oreopoulos, von Wachter and Heisz (2012). 17      See Abel, Deitz and Su (2014). 18      Yellen (2012).    4                                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches the system as a whole. That is now reflected in the Bank of England�s responsibility to bring a macroprudential perspective to financial stability policy.  Financial reform and rebuilding social capital Central banks� greatest contribution to inclusive capitalism may be driving financial reforms that are helping to re-build the necessary social capital. In doing so, we need to recognise the tension between pure free market capitalism, which reinforces the primacy of the individual at the expense of the system, and social capital which requires from individuals a broader sense of responsibility for the system. A sense of self must be accompanied by a sense of the systemic. Consider four financial reforms that are helping to create this sense of the systemic and thereby rebuild trust in the system.  First, ending Too-Big-To-Fail Perhaps the most severe blow to public trust was the revelation that there were scores of too-big-to-fail institutions operating at the heart of finance. Bankers made enormous sums in the run-up to the crisis and were often well compensated after it hit. In turn, taxpayers picked up the tab for their failures. That unjust sharing of risk and reward contributed directly to inequality but � more importantly � has had a corrosive effect on the broader social fabric of which finance is part and on which it relies. By replacing such implicit privilege with the full discipline of the market, social capital can be rebuilt and economic dynamism increased. The leaders of the G20 have endorsed measures to restore capitalism to the capitalists by ending too-big-to-fail and, in response, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has identified systemically important institutions; made them subject to higher standards of resilience; and developed a range of tools to ensure that, if they do fail, they can be resolved without severe disruption to the financial system and without exposing the taxpayer to loss. This is the year to complete that job. Governments must introduce legislative reforms to make all systemically important companies, including banks, resolvable. Jurisdictions must also empower supervisors to reach agreements for credible cross?border resolution plans. The FSB is developing proposals, for the G20 summit in Brisbane, on total loss absorbing capacity for institutions, so that private creditors stand in front of taxpayers when banks fail. In addition, we are working with industry to change derivative contracts so that all counterparties stay in while resolution of a failing firm is underway.  Second, creating fair and effective markets In recent years, a host of scandals in fixed income, currency and commodity markets have been exposed. Merely prosecuting the guilty to the full extent of the law will not be sufficient to address the issues raised. Authorities and market participants must also act to re-create fair and effective markets. In the Bank of England�s view, changes to both the hard and soft infrastructure of markets will be required. Examples of the former include reforming the calculations of benchmarks such as Libor or the daily foreign exchange fixes. The upcoming FSB report on these issues, co-chaired by the Financial Conduct Authority�s (FCA) Martin Wheatley and the Fed�s Jeremy Stein, will be decisive in this regard. Consideration should also be given to increasing pre- and post-trade transparency in a host of fixed income markets and accelerating the G20 pledge to move the trading of all standardised derivatives onto electronic exchanges and platforms.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                   5 Such changes are vital, but they cannot anticipate every contingency or discipline every miscreant. The scandals highlight a malaise in corners of finance that must be remedied. Many banks have rightly developed codes of ethics or business principles, but have all their traders absorbed their meaning? A first step to restore trust in markets might be to rely on traders� intuitive understanding of what makes a true market. Consideration should be given to developing principles of fair markets, codes of conduct for specific markets, and even regulatory obligations within this framework. There should be clear consequences including professional ostracism for failing to meet these standards. The basic point is that all market participants, large and small, should recognise that market integrity is essential to fair financial capitalism. Confidence in the integrity of those markets needs to be reinforced alongside genuine competition to ensure that the needs of end customers are properly and effectively served. Doing so will reinforce the City�s well- deserved reputation as the world�s leading financial centre, with the most effective and efficient markets.  Third, reforming compensation Dominic Barton and Mark Wiseman (2014) have detailed the need for long-term thinking by concentrating on shareholder incentives. A related lesson of the crisis was that compensation schemes that delivered large bonuses for short-term returns encouraged individuals to take on too much long-term and tail risk. In short, the present was overvalued and the future heavily discounted. To align better incentives with the long-term interests of the firm � and, more broadly, society � major changes are underway. At the request of G20 Leaders, the FSB has developed the principles for sound compensation practices to align incentives with long-term risks. Here in the UK, the Bank of England has adopted a new code for banks prescribing deferred variable performance payments, introducing the ability to reduce deferred bonuses when subsequent performance reveals them not to have been fully deserved, and paying bonuses in stock rather than cash. The deferral of bonuses awarded today allows them to be reduced before they are paid if evidence emerges of employee misconduct, error, failure of risk management or unexpectedly poor financial performance by the individual, their team or company. We are continuing to refine our approach. The Bank has just completed a consultation on a requirement for variable remuneration to be clawed back after payment and will consult later in the year on new standards for bonus deferrals. These provisions will apply not only to employees who are judged culpable directly, but also to others who could reasonably have been expected to identify and manage risks or misconduct but did not take steps to do so, and senior executives who could reasonably be deemed responsible by establishing the culture and strategy of the organisation. Where problems of performance or risk management are pervasive, bonuses should be adjusted for whole groups of employees. Of course, no compensation package can fully internalise the impact of individual actions on systemic risks, including on trust in the system. 19 To do so, market participants need to become true stakeholders. That is, they must recognise that their actions do not merely affect their personal rewards, but also the legitimacy of the system in which they operate.     19      More fundamentally, to think that compensation arrangements can ensure virtue is to miss the point entirely.      Integrity cannot be legislated, and it certainly cannot be bought. It must come from within. See Carney (2013).    6                                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches Fourth, building a sense of vocation and responsibility To build this sense of the systemic, business ultimately needs to be seen as a vocation, an activity with high ethical standards, which in turn conveys certain responsibilities. It can begin by asking the right questions. Who does finance serve? Itself? The real economy? Society? And to whom is the financier responsible? Herself? His business? Their system? The answers start from recognising that financial capitalism is not an end in itself, but a means to promote investment, innovation, growth and prosperity. Banking is fundamentally about intermediation � connecting borrowers and savers in the real economy. In the run-up to the crisis, banking became about banks not businesses; transactions not relations; counterparties not clients. New instruments originally designed to meet the credit and hedging needs of businesses quickly morphed into ways to amplify bets on financial outcomes. When bankers become detached from end-users, their only reward becomes money. Purely financial compensation ignores the non-pecuniary rewards to employment, such as the satisfaction from helping a client or colleague succeed. This reductionist view of the human condition is a poor foundation for ethical financial institutions needed to support long-term prosperity. To help rebuild that foundation, financiers, like all of us, need to avoid compartmentalisation � the division of our lives into different realms, each with its own set of rules. Home is distinct from work; ethics from law; the individual from the system. 20 This process begins with boards and senior management defining clearly the purpose of their organisations and promoting a culture of ethical business throughout them. Employees must be grounded in strong connections to their clients and their communities. To move to a world that once again values the future, bankers need to see themselves as custodians of their institutions, improving them before passing them along to their successors. In the UK, two important initiatives are in train to help accomplish these ends. The first is a new regime for regulating the senior-most managers of banks. That regime, proposed by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards and now being established by the Bank of England seeks to reverse the blurring of the link between seniority and accountability that has developed over the years. Its underlying principles are relevant across the financial sector. People who run major firms should have clearly defined responsibilities and behave with integrity, honesty and skill regardless of whether they work for global investment banks, regional building societies or insurance companies. We are now considering a similar regime for senior persons in the insurance sector. This does not mean applying the banking regime indiscriminately. For one thing there is no statutory provision for applying a �reverse burden of proof� in insurance. For another, Solvency II requires us to monitor the fitness and propriety of a broader range of staff than in banks. In coming months we will build on the provisions of legislation to produce a regime that in spirit is aligned with the standards to which we hold bankers, but that in practice is a tailored approach for insurers. It will combine accountability with efficiency. Ultimately, of course, social capital is not contractual; integrity can neither be bought nor regulated. Even with the best possible framework of codes, principles, compensation   20      As the CEO of TD Bank, Ed Clark, observed, �Bank leaders created cultures around a simple principle: if it�s      legal and others are doing it, we should do it too if it makes money. It didn�t matter if it was the right thing to do      for the customer, community or country.� See Clark (2012).    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                            7 schemes and market discipline, financiers must constantly challenge themselves to the standards they uphold. A meaningful change in the culture of banking will require a true commitment from the industry. That is why a second initiative, the creation of the Banking Standards Review Council (BSRC), is particularly welcome. 21 This new independent body, again proposed by the Parliamentary Commission, is designed to create a sense of vocation in banking by promoting high standards of competence and behaviour across the UK industry. The BSRC will complement the work of regulators by setting out a single principles-based code of practice, based on the high-level principles now being considered by the Prudential Regulation Authority and FCA. Among other things, this should aim to guide behaviour in the face of conflicts of interest or of moral ambiguity. It will also identify activities where voluntary standards of good practice would be in the public interest, and work with industry to develop them. And it will engage with banks to establish good practice in developing the competence and training requirements of staff covered by the Certified Persons regime. A prime objective of the BSRC will be to help individual banks and building societies to drive up standards of behaviour and competence through a process of internal and external assessment. It will work with banks to encourage a process of continuous improvement, and regularly assess and disclose the performance of each bank under the three broad headings of culture, competence and development of the workforce, and outcomes for customers. The BSRC is an important sign of banks� recognition of the need for change. Its impact over time will be a crucial test of the industry�s commitment to that change.  Conclusion By encouraging enterprise and rewarding individual initiative, market-based economies provide the essential conditions for economic progress. But social capital must be maintained for that progress to be consistently delivered. The combination of unbridled faith in financial markets prior to the crisis and the recent demonstrations of corruption in some of these markets has eroded social capital. When combined with the longer-term pressures of globalisation and technology on the basic social contract, an unstable dynamic of declining trust in the financial system and growing exclusivity of capitalism threatens. To counter this, rebuilding social capital is paramount. Financial reform is now helping. Globally systemic banks are simplifying and downsizing. Some are de-emphasising high-profile but risky businesses that benefited employees more than shareholders and society. Authorities are working feverishly to end too-big-to-fail. The structure of compensation is being reformed so that horizons are longer and rewards match risk. Regulation is hard-wiring the responsibilities of senior management. And new codes are seeking to re-establish finance as a true profession, with broader societal obligations. A welcome addition to these initiatives would be changes to the hard and soft infrastructure of financial markets to make them dynamic and fair. Through all of these measures, finance can help to deliver a more trustworthy, inclusive capitalism � one which embeds a sense of the systemic and in which individual virtue and collective prosperity can flourish.     21      Sir Richard Lambert�s Review was commissioned by the Chairmen of Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Nationwide,      RBS, Santander and Standard Chartered in response to the recommendations of the Parliamentary      Commission on Banking Standards.

2014-06-13	"Mark Carney: Speech at the Mansion House Bankers and Merchants Dinner Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Lord Mayor�s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London at the Mansion House, London, 12 June 2014.                                            *    *   *  Introduction My Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen. A year ago when my predecessor Lord King delivered his final Mansion House speech, he noted �clear signs that a recovery in the UK, albeit modest, [was] underway.� That recovery was due in no small part to measures he and his colleagues had initiated including extraordinary monetary stimulus, recapitalisation of the banking system and innovative support for lending. The task a year ago was to secure that recovery in the face of continued domestic frailties and ongoing international weaknesses. At home, unemployment and underemployment remained elevated, productivity growth was anaemic, and debt levels were high. Abroad, the European crisis had moved only from its acute to its chronic phase and financial markets were demonstrating their fragility during the �taper tantrum�. With this backdrop and with real wages around 10% below their pre-crisis levels, it was not surprising that consumer confidence, though improved, remained low. Business confidence was similarly shaken by past shocks and current scepticism about the ongoing strength of demand. The Bank responded to these challenges. Forward guidance gave households and businesses confidence that Bank Rate would not be raised at least until jobs, incomes and spending were growing at sustainable rates. Guidance encouraged businesses to hire and spend, and helped keep expected interest rates low, even as the economy recovered strongly. In parallel, we encouraged banks to continue repairing their balance sheets. Changes to the Bank�s liquidity policy further supported lending. The core of the financial system is now on a sound footing and making an increasingly important contribution to the recovery. We are now faced with the challenge of turning that recovery, which has steadily gained momentum and breadth over the past year, into a durable expansion. To do so, we need balance. Its absence can have serious consequences. One has only to look back to 1931 when Britain�s economic prospects were strained by high unemployment, a large budget deficit and a deteriorating balance of payments. In the ensuing crisis sterling was forced off the gold standard and the government of the day resigned.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                              1 And the Governor? With the uncanny foresight of a central banker, Montagu Norman had already left the scene �to get a bit of rest [in Quebec]�, he said, �for I have had a very hard time of it lately and I have not been so well as I would like to be.�1 However tempting, I will lean on Canada not for restoration but for a nautical analogy to describe how we can address the challenges we now face. Rather than appeal to the stately Duchess of York on which my predecessor sailed, I will look to the trusty canoe � a craft that can navigate the most rapid and treacherous waters�provided its paddlers work in sync. Those economic currents are flowing swiftly, with the economy expanding at an annualised rate of 4% and jobs growing at a record pace.2 But there are rapids ahead, with old imbalances persisting and new ones emerging. The economy is still over-levered. The housing market is showing the potential to overheat. And the current account deficit is now at a record level. Navigating these hazards requires close coordination between all those in the boat; that is, between fiscal, monetary and prudential authorities. Tonight I want to explain the Bank�s contribution to delivering a durable expansion characterised by balance in the macroeconomy, the housing market, and the financial sector. Before doing so, I would like to join the Chancellor in paying tribute to two individuals. The first is Sir David Lees, who as Chairman of Court has overseen the transformation of the governance and responsibilities of the Bank. David, I am extremely grateful for your support during my first year as Governor. I�m also enormously grateful for the wise counsel of Charlie Bean during the past year. Always working, Charlie is tonight discharging his duties as President of the Royal Economic Society. Throughout his career, at the Treasury, in academia and at the Bank, Charlie has been a leading thinker and practitioner in the pursuit of macroeconomic balance. Internationally he has inspired countless policymakers, myself included. On behalf of all colleagues past and present, I would like to echo the Chancellor by thanking Charlie for his exceptional period of public service and the enormous contribution he has made to the economic well-being of this country.  Macroeconomic balance The UK economy is currently unbalanced internally and externally. Internally, there is wasteful spare capacity � an output gap � concentrated in the labour market. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) currently estimates this gap to be around 1�1�% of GDP, though we caution against false precision as there are wide confidence bands around this central view. The MPC�s current guidance makes clear that we will set monetary policy to meet the inflation target while using up that spare capacity. This has implications for the timing, pace and degree of Bank Rate increases. There�s already great speculation about the exact timing of the first rate hike and this decision is becoming more balanced. It could happen sooner than markets currently expect.   1     As reported in the Montreal Gazette, August 17, 1931. The Financial Times of the same day reported Norman as     saying �I feel I want a bit of a rest, because I have had a very hard time lately. I haven�t been quite as well as I     would like, and I think the trip will do me good�. 2     Bank staff project annualised growth of 4% for the current quarter. That incorporates expected upward revisions     to early official estimates.  2                                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches But to be clear, the MPC has no pre-set course. The ultimate decision will be data-driven. At this point it is safest to conclude, as the MPC has, that there remains scope for spare capacity to be used up before policy is tightened and that a host of labour market, capacity utilisation and pricing indicators should be watched closely to determine how that slack is evolving. Growth has been much stronger and unemployment has fallen much faster than either we or anyone else expected at last year�s Mansion House dinner. So far this has been largely matched by indicators which suggest that there is more supply capacity in the labour market than we had previously thought. As a result of these two welcome developments, despite rapid jobs growth, pay pressures and unit labour cost growth have remained subdued.3 The MPC expects the rate at which slack is being eroded to slow during the second half of this year as output growth eases and productivity growth recovers. But thus far there are few signs of a deceleration in output growth. And a challenge in deciding when to begin normalising policy is that actual output can be observed but potential supply cannot. That is why the MPC is monitoring a broad range of indicators including coincident ones such as the behaviour of wages and prices. Of course navigating the upcoming bend in the river isn�t the end of the journey. The MPC has rightly stressed that the timing of the first Bank Rate increase is less important than the path thereafter � that is, the degree and pace of increases after they start. In particular, we expect that eventual increases in Bank Rate will be gradual and limited. That is because the economy will face the ongoing challenges of public and private balance sheet repair, a 10% appreciation of sterling over the past year or so, and muted growth in our main export markets. In addition, in the medium term, higher capital, liquidity and other prudential requirements can be expected to lead to higher spreads between borrowing rates and risk-free rates than before the crisis. Moreover, a highly indebted private sector is particularly sensitive to interest rates.4 Caution over the path of rate increases once they begin is also needed because we start at a point from which interest rates cannot easily be reduced. The effects of an excessive or an excessively rapid tightening of monetary policy could prove damaging and difficult to undo. Perhaps for these reasons, financial markets expect Bank Rate to rise to only 2�% over the next three years and, on that basis, the MPC expects the economy to move towards internal balance � almost closing the output gap � in the same period. Just achieving internal balance will not be enough to guarantee a durable expansion. It matters how we do so. Excessive reliance on consumption or non-tradable sectors, such as housing, all financed by borrowing abroad at an overvalued exchange rate would prove only temporarily satisfying. The UK�s current account deficit is at a record level. The perennial trade deficit has been reinforced by the fact that the UK is growing much faster than its main trading partners. More    3     In May 2013, the MPC projected annual growth of 1.7% for 2014Q1, only half of the rate at which it now     estimates the economy to have grown over that period. Meanwhile the 2014Q1 outturn for unemployment, at     6.8%, was some 0.8ppt below the MPC�s May 2013 central projection. Despite these upward surprises to activity,     annual earnings growth in 2014Q1 was 0.5ppt weaker than expected in May last year. That contributed to annual     unit wage costs growth around 1ppt below the MPC�s May 2013 central projection. 4     Private non-financial sector debt is 163% of GDP. Around two thirds of bank loans to individuals and more than     half of loans to businesses are at variable interest rates.  BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                 3 recently the sharp fall in the returns we earn on our investments abroad has led to a negative 3% swing in our net investment income. This is not an immediate cause for alarm. As the world and particularly Europe recovers, demand for our products and returns on our investments should increase. More competitiveness gains from the past depreciation may yet be realised, and in any event, unlike for much of Montagu Norman�s time, our exchange rate will remain flexible. Nonetheless, sustained borrowing from abroad to consume at home is hardly a recipe for a balanced and sustainable expansion. Borrowing to invest, improve productivity, competitiveness and incomes is. Amidst much commentary about an unbalanced recovery, it should not be forgotten that business investment has accounted for more than a quarter of GDP growth over the past six months. The MPC�s forecasts rely on continued rapid growth of business investment over the next few years, leading to a revival in productivity and real wages, which in turn will allow consumption to grow without an unsustainable decline in household savings. Creating the right conditions for investment is thus essential. In a world of corporate caution this will likely require interest rates consistent with our guidance. The Bank is well aware that such a monetary stance could encourage other risks to develop. For instance, there is evidence of growing vulnerabilities in financial markets. Across asset classes, implied volatilities are well below their long-term averages. Spreads in high yield and peripheral bond markets have collapsed. And covenant-light loans are the new normal. While the banking system is much more robust to spikes in volatility, end investors may not have fully absorbed the extent to which financial reforms will distribute shocks across the financial system. This may be a case of still waters running deep � often the most dangerous time on the river. That is why an essential counterpart to our monetary stance is macroprudential vigilance and activism. Nowhere is the need for that more acute than in the housing market.  Balance in housing Across the country, house prices have risen by around 10% over the past year, approaching their early 2007 levels. Price inflation has broadened and accelerated across regions. Expectations that prices will continue to rise are now most marked outside London. There have been some signs of a slowdown in activity, with mortgage approvals falling back to their mid-2013 levels. The Bank is watching closely to determine the extent to which this reflects an underlying slowing of housing demand. However, some of this likely stems from lenders adjusting to the Financial Conduct Authority�s (FCA) tough new Mortgage Market Review underwriting requirements. More worryingly, surveys suggest some slowing could reflect would-be sellers holding back properties from the market in anticipation of higher future prices � an early sign of extrapolative price expectations. The underlying dynamic of the housing market reflects a chronic shortage of housing supply, which the Bank of England can�t tackle directly.5 Since we are not able to build a single house, I welcome the Chancellor�s announcement tonight of measures to increase housing supply.    5     Ten years ago, former MPC member Kate Barker estimated that construction of around 260,000 homes a year     would be necessary to contain real house price growth at 1 per cent per annum (Barker, 2004). Far fewer have in     fact been built in the years since � just 110,000 in 2013. Because housing demand tends to rise more than one- 4                                                                                        BIS central bankers� speeches To be clear, the Bank does not target asset price inflation in general or house prices in particular. It is indebtedness that concerns us. This is partly because over-extended borrowers could threaten the resilience of the core of the financial system since credit to households represents the lion�s share of UK banks� domestic lending. It is also because rapid growth in or high levels of mortgage debt can affect the stability of the economy as a whole. An economic expansion is more precarious if there are a large proportion of heavily indebted households. History shows that the British people do everything they can to pay their mortgages. That means cutting back deeply on other expenditures when the unexpected happens, potentially slowing the economy sharply. That�s why recessions that follow rapid credit growth tend to be deeper and longer lasting. It is for these reasons that the Bank of England�s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) is mandated to address systemic risks arising from unsustainable levels of debt, leverage or credit growth. In this regard, the UK starts from a vulnerable position with household debt at 140% of disposable income.6 There are some signs that underwriting standards are becoming more lax, with the proportion of new mortgages at high loan-to-income ratios now at an all-time high.7 The increase in house prices in the past year means we can expect the proportion of high loan-to- income mortgages to grow further in the coming year even if the housing market begins to slow. This is concerning because a durable expansion requires mortgages to be serviceable over their lifetime not just when interest rates are at record lows. The vulnerabilities associated with debt build up over longer periods than the ups and downs with which monetary policy is usually concerned. In that sense, the credit and business cycles are distinct. Using monetary policy now to target indebtedness would risk undershooting the inflation target and damaging growth. For all of these reasons, monetary policy is the last line of defence against financial instability. Raising interest rates today would be the wrong response to this potential vulnerability tomorrow. Fortunately, we are not up the proverbial creek without a paddle. We have many of them which we can use to steer towards two objectives. The first is to ensure that the banking system is resilient. To that end, the Bank is conducting a stress test to assess how well major banks and building societies can withstand a sharp housing market correction during a prolonged and painful recession. The results and any consequences that flow from them will be announced later this year. The second objective is to reduce the risk of excessive indebtedness itself by taking out insurance. Given recent experience, few can now believe that the right policy is to wait to mop        for-one with income, supply constraints are likely to put increasing pressure on prices in a now rapidly-growing     economy. 6     That is high relative to other advanced economies. Household debt stands at between 105% and 115% of     disposable income across the Euro-area, US and Japan (IMF, 2014). 7     By latest estimates, around 40% of new mortgages were at LTIs of at least 3.5x. 25% at were at LTIs of at least     4x. 10% were at LTIs of at least 4.5x.  BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                   5 up the consequences of debt-driven busts after they crystallise. That is even more obvious when Bank Rate is at its effective lower bound. In other words, when you hear the thunder of the falls, it is wise to get off the river. Measures to take out insurance can be graduated and proportionate if action is taken sufficiently early. We can limit risks tomorrow by acting against a loosening in underwriting standards in new mortgage lending today. The value of acting early is reinforced by uncertainty around the precise impact of macroprudential tools. While these have proven effective in other countries, they are still relatively novel here.8 By acting, assessing, and if necessary re-calibrating, we are more likely to strike the right balance to support durable growth over the medium term. That�s why authorities have already moved. Last autumn we took our foot off the accelerator by removing capital relief for banks on new mortgages and, with the Treasury, by re-focussing the Funding for Lending Scheme away from mortgages towards business lending. Those steps were followed by the implementation in April of the Mortgage Market Review to reinforce banks� underwriting standards and the stress test to underpin their capital discipline. The FPC has a wide range of other tools if further action is justified. We can direct lenders to raise capital held against mortgages or against all credit. Thanks to the FCA, we are now able to recommend a tougher interest rate stress to which new borrowers are subjected when banks assess affordability. We can also make prudential recommendations about the share of high loan to income, loan to value and long tenor mortgages in banks� and building societies� new lending. In this regard, I applaud the Chancellor�s intention to grant the FPC additional directive powers in relation to these aspects of mortgage portfolio composition. I also welcome the Chancellor�s commitment to adjust the Help to Buy Mortgage Guarantee Scheme to comply in full with any FPC actions. When we meet later this month, the FPC will weigh carefully recent and prospective changes in activity, prices and credit as well as the merits of graduated and proportionate actions to mitigate the potential vulnerabilities arising from what is the greatest risk to the domestic economy.  Balance in financial markets The housing market is not the only market at risk of losing balance. Confidence in some core financial markets has been buffeted by revelations of manipulation of interest rate, FX and commodity benchmarks. There have been too many such episodes to think each is an aberration. We are working to restore balance through reforms based on the firm belief that the City�s strength is founded on markets. To restore the primacy of true markets, authorities are already seeking to:     8     Lim et al (2011) use data from 49 countries from 2000�10 to examine the efficacy of various macroprudential     measures, including loan-to-value and debt-to-income caps, on mitigating systemic risk. They find that caps on     loan-to-value ratios, caps on debt-to-income ratios, ceilings on credit or credit growth, reserve requirements,     countercyclical capital requirements and time-varying/dynamic provisioning help to dampen pro-cyclicality. See     also Dell�Ariccia et al (2012).  6                                                                                        BIS central bankers� speeches �           End too big to fail. I thank many of you who are engaged with the Bank and the             Treasury to help make this the year we complete the job. �           Align risk and reward by developing a new remuneration code. This is not about the             societal question of the level of pay, but about the prudential question of its structure.             To properly align risk and reward, the Prudential Regulation Authority will be             prescribing deferral of variable remuneration, the ability to reduce deferred bonuses             when subsequent performance reveals them to be undeserved, and the ability to claw             back bonuses after payment. But as the Chancellor stressed tonight, we must do more. Recent events have shown the necessity of measures to ensure the fairness and effectiveness of core markets. That is why I welcome wholeheartedly the Fair and Effective Markets Review announced tonight by the Chancellor, and to be led by the Bank�s new Deputy Governor, Minouche Shafik. Through that Review, we will build true markets: �           Markets that are open and transparent; �           Markets where access extends beyond a privileged few; �           Markets where all who wish to trade have common information and commonly             accessible prices; and �           Markets where the informational integrity of key benchmarks is beyond question. Some of this will require changes to the way markets work, including changes to how benchmarks are calculated and the implementation of reforms currently underway to create greater pre- and post-trade transparency of standardised derivatives. Some can be delivered, as the Chancellor announced, by bringing more activities within the scope of regulation. And some may require new codes of conduct. Specific codes for professionals in markets will complement broader efforts to raise standards in banking by the new Banking Standards Review Council. For those in markets we need a simple approach that recognises a fundamental principle of the City: namely that true markets are the source of dynamism, prosperity and progress. Seeking to manipulate, game or profit from unfair access transgresses that principle. It weakens the effectiveness of markets for all. It holds back prosperity. It should thus have clear consequences, including professional ostracism. We must work together to ensure that everyone on every trading floor understands that dealing in a market means serving the needs of clients, investors and customers fairly and effectively. I am delighted that one of the City�s most experienced professionals and proven leaders, Elizabeth Corley, has agreed to chair a panel of market practitioners that will inform the Review. Now, recognising the centrality of markets doesn�t mean the Bank has a na�ve faith that all markets always function smoothly. The City�s markets are not those of a textbook. We all know that real markets can seize up in crises of confidence, threatening financial stability and the wider economy. Just as there will be times when central banks must backstop the banking system, there are also times when they should backstop core markets in a way that supports their contribution to the real economy but doesn�t encourage excessive risk taking.   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                     7 That need was behind the recent transformation of the Bank of England�s sterling market framework for banks, and it is why I can announce that, in the coming year, the Bank will widen access to our facilities to include the largest broker-dealers regulated in the UK and to those central counterparties authorised to operate in UK markets. We will also look into whether we should further develop our capacity to lend in currencies other than sterling.  Conclusion As tonight�s announcements demonstrate, promoting a durable and balanced expansion will sometimes require coordination between the Bank, the Treasury, other public authorities and the private sector. The Bank will also have to act on its own by using all of its tools in as complementary a fashion as possible. The FPC is considering using macroprudential tools to insure against potential vulnerabilities associated with the housing market. Doing so could reduce the need for monetary policy to be diverted to address a sector-specific risk. However, macroprudential policy is not a substitute for monetary policy. If it is used for insurance it won�t necessarily affect the path of interest rate increases. The need for internal balance � to use up wasteful spare capacity while achieving the inflation target � will likely require gradual and limited interest rate increases as the expansion progresses. The start of that journey is coming nearer. Unlike a canoe trip, the quest for economic balance never ends. With economies and markets always moving between equilibria, it is the journey that matters. By working together we can make that journey as pleasant and as prosperous as possible. The need to work together extends beyond policymakers to all in the City. So I am delighted to take up co-presidency of Heart of the City with you, Lord Mayor. This umbrella group for City charities, co-founded by Eddie George fourteen years ago, is a great example of how cooperation and social responsibility can be at the heart of business, building the social capital necessary for vibrant and inclusive capitalism. Fiona, you are to be commended for the energy and enthusiasm you have brought to your role � as well as the excellent hospitality you have provided tonight. So let me invite everyone here to rise and join me in a toast of good health and prosperity to �The Lord Mayor and the Lord Mayor�s Consort�, Fiona and Nicholas Woolf.

2014-07-29	"Mark Carney: Winning the economic marathon Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Commonwealth Games Business Conference, Glasgow, 23 July 2014.                                                  *    *       *  Accompanying charts can be found at the end of the speech.  It is a pleasure to be in Glasgow for the opening of the 20th Commonwealth Games. For the athletes, the games represent the culmination of years of training. For fans they are a chance to witness great sporting achievements. I remember attending the 1978 games in my hometown of Edmonton and being mesmerised by one of its stars: Scotland�s Allan Wells. At just 26, Wells burst onto the scene, winning silver in the 100 metres, beating the reigning Olympic champion in the process. He spurred Scotland to gold in the 4x100 metres, won the 200 metres outright and set the stage to become the fastest man in the world two years later at the Olympics. The UK economy has also had some sprint success of late and is the current holder of the �fastest growing advanced economy in the world� title. That is welcome after some difficult years, but what really matters is what comes next. The bigger prize is winning the economic marathon by achieving a durable expansion. We must replicate the sprint success of Wells over longer distances, taking our lead from Scotland�s Liz McColgan, who memorably won gold in the 10,000 metres last time the Games were held in Scotland, before going on to win the New York, Tokyo and London marathons. To understand how we � and by �we� I mean the UK, the Commonwealth and the world � can win the economic marathon, I want to draw on three less athletic, but nevertheless great, Scots, each of whom points us to an essential ingredient of economic success: the right policy framework; an open trading system; and fair and effective financial markets. In all these respects, the UK is leading the way.  The right policy framework The UK�s current policy framework has its origins in the work of William Paterson of Skipmyre, Dumfriesshire. More than three centuries ago Paterson proposed the establishment of the Bank of England to �promote the publick Good and Benefit of our People�� 1 At that time the public good meant financing a war with France. Over the ensuing centuries, as objectives evolved, Paterson�s bank would have many guises including government banker, lender of last resort, bank supervisor and monetary authority. Today, having learned the lessons of the crisis, we understand that the Bank of England can best serve the public good by maintaining monetary and financial stability. Let me briefly explain how we are pursuing those objectives which are building blocks of a balanced and sustainable expansion. As I mentioned earlier, the UK economy has been growing rapidly. Over the past year, job creation has been the quickest on record, pushing unemployment down to 6.5 per cent. The economy is finally producing as much as it did on the eve of the crisis in 2008, and inflation is back near its 2 per cent target. In short, the UK economy is starting to head back to normal.    1     Bank of England founding charter, 1694.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  1 As the economy normalises, Bank Rate will need to start to rise in order to achieve the inflation target. But the MPC has no pre-set course and the timing of any increases in interest rates will be determined by the data. In this regard, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is balancing the implications for inflation of hard evidence of sustained economic momentum against conflicting signals over the degree of slack in the labour market. While some indicators such as wages suggest that there was more labour supply than we had previously thought, it is also true that spare capacity is being used up a bit more rapidly than we had expected. A key judgment for the MPC is when and to what extent these developments will translate into real wage growth, and in turn that wage growth into price pressures. Next month�s Inflation Report provides the next opportunity to update our thinking on these important questions. A durable expansion rests ultimately on moving from anaemic to strong productivity growth. Only that can improve export competitiveness and underpin consistent increases, rather than falls, in real wages. To generate needed productivity growth will require recent strong business investment growth �10% over the past year � to be sustained. The MPC is supporting investment through clear guidance that it expects increases in Bank Rate, once they begin, to be gradual and limited. From my own experience visiting businesses up and down the country, including some in Glasgow earlier today, I know that businesses understand this message. This guidance puts all the short-term noise about when the first rate rise will be into its proper context and it encourages firms to hire and invest with an eye to the medium term. Why does the MPC expect Bank Rate increases, once they begin, to be gradual and limited? This is in part because the headwinds facing the economy are likely to take some time to die down. These headwinds include public balance sheet repair, a highly indebted private sector likely to be particularly sensitive to interest rates, as well as the drag from a 12% appreciation of sterling over the past year and the persistent muted demand from our main export markets. Over the medium term, several dynamics are likely to keep rates lower than in the past. UK rates could be restrained by continued imbalances between global saving and investment, together with potentially lower rates of global productivity growth. The MPC can also be expected to accommodate with lower risk-free rates the higher spreads that are likely to result from new regulatory requirements. All of these factors likely mean that, even when spare capacity is used up, Bank Rate will need to be materially lower than in the past in order to keep the economy operating at its potential and inflation at its target. The Bank is well aware that a prolonged period of historically low interest rates could encourage other risks to develop. In the UK, the biggest risks are associated with the housing market, which is why last month the Bank�s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) took graduated and proportionate actions. The Bank�s role is not to control house prices. Nor can the Bank do anything to address the severe structural problems across the UK caused by a chronic lack of new housing supply. Our job is to mitigate the risks to the broader economy that arise from these underlying challenges. It is the prospects for household indebtedness that concern us. UK households start from a vulnerable position, with debt at 140% of disposable income and the share of riskier mortgage lending rising markedly over the past year. Housing debt can represent a major risk because mortgages are both the largest asset of UK banks and the largest liability of UK households.   2                                                                            BIS central bankers� speeches The FPC does not believe that household indebtedness poses an imminent threat to stability. Underwriting standards are more responsible than in the past. But we have seen time and again how quickly responsible can turn to reckless, creating risks that ultimately derail the economy. Allow me to explain why this matters to everyone from Land�s End to John O�Groats, even those who do not own homes. History shows that the British people do everything they can to pay their mortgages. That means cutting back deeply on expenditures when the unexpected happens. If a lot of people are highly indebted, that could tip the economy into recession. Recessions that follow periods of rapid credit growth tend to be deeper and longer lasting. Since we start from a vulnerable position, we need to be especially careful. To insure today against such risks in the future, the Bank has introduced both new affordability tests for borrowers and a cap on the proportion of any lender�s new residential mortgages at high multiples of borrowers� incomes. By acting early, the Bank can reduce the need for more drastic action later on. And by acting as we have, we can encourage a broadening of the housing market recovery. We recognise that there are large differences in housing markets across the UK. Around one in five new London mortgages are extended at or above 4.5 times borrower income, compared to one in ten across the UK as a whole, and one in twenty in Scotland. Capping the riskiest borrowing means that for every high ratio mortgage six must be extended at lower ratios. This helps spread lending capacity across the country, further contributing to balanced growth and a sustained economic expansion.  Trade Good domestic policy cannot, on its own, guarantee balanced growth in an open economy like the UK�s. Our fortunes are also tied to those of our trading partners. In recent years those fortunes have been modest. Demand from the UK�s traditional markets, such as Europe, is a staggering 25% below a continuation of its pre-crisis trend. This is because the UK relies heavily on the slow-growing advanced economies (Chart 1). In contrast, the Commonwealth countries, which account for only a tenth of UK exports, have grown over three percentage points faster on average each year than our major trading partners between 2008�13. The need to diversify trade to faster-growing economies in the Commonwealth and emerging markets is clear. This will require both the continued initiative of UK businesses and a determined trade strategy. In short, we all need to be inspired by another great Scottish figure, David Hume. Hume brilliantly showed that free trade was beneficial to all; that it acquainted nations �with the pleasures of luxury, and the profits of commerce�, spurring them on �to further improvements in every branch of domestic and foreign trade.� 2 His ideas helped usher in the first great era of globalisation during the 19th century. In this wave, the British economy grew twice as fast as during the preceding century (Table 1). Almost exactly a century ago, the outbreak of the First World War brought this incredible period of prosperity to an end. It would take almost half a century for it to start to be rebuilt and another 30 years before it fully gathered steam.     2     David Hume, �Of Commerce�, Selected Essays, Oxford University Press, 1993.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  3 Now globalisation is again under threat with the financial crisis raising the spectre of protectionism. G20 leadership has thus far prevented this from happening, but the G20�s commitment to resisting protectionism is ultimately a defensive agenda. The UK can help lead a more positive one by spurring on new deals such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the EU and the US. And trade diversification can be promoted through the pursuit of more bilateral initiatives such as those underway with India and China. Likewise the rich diversity of economies across the Commonwealth provides opportunities for all parties to gain from greater international trade.  Fair and effective financial markets Open trade requires open finance. To secure the latter requires nothing less than the re- founding of the global financial system. Since the crisis, globalised finance has been under siege. Cross-border capital flows have fallen sharply. There are constant pressures to Balkanise financial systems � myopic attempts to protect one country that weaken us all. As the leading global financial system, the UK will be central to completing the job of financial reforms that support an open and integrated system. To do so, we must make global finance more resilient and fair. To make the system more resilient, funding and derivatives markets are being overhauled. Formerly risky areas of shadow banking, such as securitisation, are being transformed into sustainable market-based sources of finance. Financial institutions are being made stronger, with a seven-fold increase in the minimum capital requirements for the world�s largest banks. In the UK alone, major banks have raised over �140 billion in new capital over the past few years and the Bank of England is now regularly testing their resilience to severe shocks. To make the system fairer, we should look to the insights of a third great Scottish figure, Adam Smith. Smith was a great advocate of competition. Its frequent absence in financial services has been corrosive. The most prominent examples are large, complex banks which privatise gains but socialise losses. The G20 summit later this year in Brisbane will be decisive in determining whether we can end too-big-to-fail. A more pernicious development has been the widespread rigging of some financial markets for personal gain. This has both diminished the effectiveness of markets and undermined trust in markets themselves. Adam Smith emphasised the importance of conduct, or what he referred to as �the established rules of behaviour,� by which �many men behave very decently, and through the whole of their lives avoid any considerable degree of blame.� 3 Those established rules of behaviour � social capital � underpin the functioning of the free market. In short, to be effective, markets must also be fair. And we need to invest in social capital just as we invest in economic capital. That is why the Bank, Treasury and Financial Conduct Authority are undertaking a major review to secure true markets. Markets:    3     Adam Smith (1789), The Theory of Moral Sentiments.     4                                                                            BIS central bankers� speeches �           that are open and transparent; �           where access extends beyond a privileged few; �           where all who wish to trade have common information and commonly accessible             prices; and �           where the informational integrity of key benchmarks is beyond question. Some of this will require changes to the way markets work. Some can be delivered by bringing more activities within the scope of regulation. And some may require new codes of conduct. We need a simple approach that recognises that the actions of a few to manipulate, game or profit from unfair access weakens the effectiveness of markets for all. Such actions hold back prosperity. They should therefore have clear consequences. Our approach should deliver true markets which are the greatest source of dynamism, prosperity and progress. Completing this agenda will reinforce the G20�s efforts to rebuild an open and resilient financial system, and in doing so it will support underpin global trade and investment to the benefit of all.  Conclusion The UK, the Commonwealth and the world have always drawn inspiration from great Scots. We must continue to do so if we want to win our economic marathon. Paterson showed us the need for a central bank. Its modern variant is a leading macroprudential institution, well equipped to face the challenges of promoting a balanced expansion. Hume demonstrated the virtues of free trade. The UK, already one of the most open economies, can help lead the development of new EU trade deals as our businesses diversify their markets. Smith showed us the importance of social capital. With a financial system that is a global good and a national asset, the UK is leading financial reforms to build a resilient global financial system with fair and effective markets at its core. And finally Wells and McColgan showed us the enormous pay-offs for hard work, dedication and perseverance. Winning the economic marathon will take similar determination. But the prize of a durable expansion is great and, if inspired by some of Scotland�s many heroes, we should not fail.

2014-09-10	"Mark Carney: Prospects for the UK labour market Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the 146th Annual Trades Union Congress, Liverpool, 9 September 2014.                                              *       *   *  President and Congress. It is a pleasure to be in Liverpool today to discuss the prospects for the UK labour market. The growth and distribution of jobs and incomes matter to everyone. Employment does much more than provide the means to support workers and their families; it is essential to personal fulfilment and human dignity. Part of that dignity is being paid a living wage. Over the past year, the Bank of England has ensured that it pays all of its 3,600 staff at least the living wage. And we have recently brought all our contracted service staff in central London up to the London living wage. We are in the process of our final review. But I can announce today the Bank�s intention to become an accredited Living Wage employer by the time of the next TUC conference. Of course, the Bank of England�s responsibilities for promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom go much further than being a responsible employer. We manage monetary policy to achieve price stability: low, stable and predictable inflation. And we promote financial stability by regulating and supervising financial institutions as well as by taking targeted actions to insure against unsustainable indebtedness, as we did earlier this year for the housing market. By maintaining price and financial stability we put in place the foundations for sustainable job creation and income growth. Stability gives workers the confidence to invest in skills or to change jobs. And it gives firms the confidence to hire new workers, invest in new equipment, introduce new products and pursue new markets. We need workers with the right skills. And we need companies taking strategic initiatives to grow productivity. That productivity is needed to secure real wage increases over the medium term. And as I will explain, the labour market is central to our decisions � decisions which must take into account both short-term fluctuations and the profound changes sweeping labour markets across advanced economies. These changes include: �           Powerful demographic forces, notably the ageing of the workforce, increases in             longevity and rising participation of women in the workplace; �           How globalisation and new technologies are splitting production chains across             companies and across borders; �           How financial risk is being steadily shifted to employees from both employers and             the state through changes to the structure of pensions and benefits, reduced job             security and evolving labour market institutions, including the union movement;     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  1 �             The sharp reduction in the employment share of middle-skilled jobs, relative to             more- and less-skilled jobs; so-called job polarisation. 1 Collectively, these trends have affected the dynamism of labour markets and the spending patterns of families. And they have interacted with the forces unleashed by the Great Recession to challenge the durability of the expansion. The Great Recession led to enormous dislocations in advanced economy labour markets. In many economies unemployment                         and     underemployment           skyrocketed.           Youth unemployment reached perilous levels. Central banks responded with unprecedented monetary stimulus. That was consistent with their price stability mandates. And it recognised the threat that the recession might permanently scar the workforce. As the recovery in many advanced economies has evolved, central banks are assessing the extent of structural changes in labour markets and are grappling with what they mean for monetary policy. The answer is not uniform across major economies. This is one reason why monetary policy in the US, euro area and the UK can be expected to be less synchronised than in recent years.  1.          A tale of three labour markets Indeed, despite common underlying influences, differences in how the labour markets of major economies responded to the Great Recession have been striking (Chart 1).  The US Take the world�s largest economy � the United States � as a benchmark. Unemployment there more than doubled during the recession. While that rate has recently fallen back, that headline is much better than the details. The number of Americans in work has only just returned to where it was before Lehman failed, even though there are now 14 million more people of working age. Much of the fall in the unemployment rate is the result of workers in their prime leaving the labour force. 2, 3     1      See, for example, Acemoglu, D and Autor, D (2011), �Skills, tasks and technologies: implications for      employment and earnings�, Handbook of Labor Economics, Volume 4b, Elsevier. 2      See Yellen, J (2014), �Labor market dynamics and monetary policy�, Remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of      Kansas City Economic Symposium, Jackson Hole. In addition, Erceg and Levin (2013) show that there was a      reduction in US participation rates of around 2�% between 2007�12. Of that, rates fell most markedly among      the young (reflecting higher educational enrolment) and �prime age� adults 25�54 years old. There was a      sharp up-tick in older workers claiming forms of social insurance; but that was partly offset by higher      participation rates among older workers, perhaps reflecting a need to offset lost retirement income. Erceg,      C and Levin, A (2013), �Labour force participation and monetary policy in the wake of the Great Recession�,      IMF Working Paper No. 13/245, July. 3      The 3pp fall in the participation rate is a marked break from its stable level in the preceding decade. Overall      participation was flat at around 66% between 2004�7. It had fallen to below 63% in early 2014 (Bureau of      Labour Statistics). By contrast, before that, and over the longer run, participation rates had been essentially      acyclical � invariant to business cycle conditions (Erceg and Levin, 2013).    2                                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches Far more vacancies remain unfilled than usual, indicating big mismatches in the labour market. And fewer people than normal are switching jobs, suggesting an ongoing reluctance to take risks. The American labour market still is not working as it once did.  The UK Even though times for many families have been tough, relative to that benchmark, the UK labour market has performed well. Despite a recession that was deeper and more prolonged, unemployment did not rise as much and has fallen back sharply since. 4 In contrast to the US, this rapid fall has been accompanied by significantly higher participation rates. There are now over one million more people in work in the UK than at the start of the crisis. Total hours worked are some 4% above their pre-crisis level. That exceptional employment performance has come at a cost, however: wage growth has been very weak. Adjusted for inflation, wages have fallen by around a tenth since the onset of the crisis. To find such a fall in the past, you would have to look back to the early 1920s. The weakness of pay has, in effect, purchased more job creation. It has not resulted in an unusually high level of profits. The burden of the Great Recession has been shared across the UK. Profits have been squeezed almost as much as labour costs. Employees have seen their real incomes reduced, but more people are in work as a result. In the US, the burden has been much more concentrated on those who have lost, and not regained, work. And in contrast to the UK, American companies have increased their profits significantly as a share of national income.  The euro area What makes the UK performance even more remarkable is that we have faced the added challenge of rebuilding competitiveness. In the run-up to the crisis, the UK�s economy had become increasingly imbalanced. When the crisis hit, sterling fell by a quarter. Prices of imported goods rose sharply and that fed through to higher inflation. The squeeze on real incomes was pronounced. And yet there were relatively few calls for higher wages to compensate. As a result of that painful adjustment, the UK is more competitive. And if the world economy returns to a surer footing, there is a real prospect that the UK can properly rebalance its economy. 5    4     Outturns for unemployment have remained some way below what would have been expected given the past     relationship between changes in unemployment and growth (Okun�s law). Year-on-year increases in     unemployment during 2008-9, for example, remained around 1ppt below a simple Okun relationship based on     data since the early 1970s. That is in stark contrast to the experience of the US in that period, where     unemployment outturns were some way above past Okun�s law relationships. 5     See Carney, M (2014), Speech at the Mansion House, June; and Broadbent, B (2014), �The balance of     growth�, Speech at the London School of Economics, January.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                            3 Euro-area countries have needed to make similar � if larger � adjustments to restore competitiveness but with less flexible labour markets and without a flexible currency (Charts 2�4). The results have been dire. Euro-area unemployment has risen sharply over two successive recessions to its current rate of over 11%. It stands at over 14% in Portugal, 20% in Spain, and 25% in Greece. Over 6% of the euro-area labour force is now long-term unemployed and in danger of becoming detached from the labour market. 6 And despite high unemployment, there is evidence of labour shortages. 7 There is a clear danger of a misplaced if not lost generation of workers in the euro area and in the US. Britain�s labour force and trade unions deserve great credit for ensuring that this risk is much lower in the UK. By sharing the burden, our economy is better positioned for the future. The question is whether we will seize the opportunity.  2.          Why the UK labour market outperformed: a labour supply shock Before considering how we can, it is helpful to understand just why the UK labour market has outperformed. When the recession hit, the demand for labour naturally fell. But surprisingly the potential supply of labour appears to have increased as well with an estimated 1.5 million people entering the labour force. The number of additional people wanting to work overwhelmed the longer-term effects of population ageing, which, all else equal, would have been expected to have removed around half a million people from the labour force (Chart 10). This expansion of the workforce is being driven mainly by women and older workers. Before the Great Recession, between 46% and 83% of those in the 50- to 64-year-old age cohort were active. Now it is between 60% and 89% (Table 1). In part this reflects a continuation of past trends within age cohorts, but it goes much further. 8 The greater risks and financial burdens that many are now facing are likely to be important drivers of the recent increase in the labour force. Changes to pension arrangements have encouraged people to work longer. 9 State pension ages are rising, and the default retirement age has been abolished. 10    6      The average of European Commission, OECD and IMF estimates of structural unemployment have increased      from 8.8% in 2008 to 10.3% in 2013, reported in Draghi, M (2014), �Unemployment in the euro area�, Speech      at the annual central bank symposium in Jackson Hole, August. 7      There is evidence of there having been an increase in skills mismatch both in the rightward shift of the euro-      area Beveridge curve and as indicated by skills mismatch indices. See Draghi (ibid.). 8      Since 2007, annual average growth in participation rates has increased by 3 basis points for those between      50 and 59 years old to between 10 and 15 basis points (Table 1). For those over 65, the increase in      participation growth rates has been around 6 basis points. Growth in participation rates also increased by      around 5 basis points for those in age cohorts between 35 and 49 since 2007. 9      Banks et al (2005) find that those in (predominantly final-salary) employer defined benefit plans report      chances of working at age 60 that are, on average, 3 percentage points lower than those of individuals in the      State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme (SERPS), an average-earnings-based defined benefit scheme.      Those with defined contribution pension arrangements report probabilities up to 7 percentage points higher      than those in SERPSs. See Banks, J, Emmerson, C and Blundell, R (2005), �The balance between defined      benefit, defined contribution, and state provision�, Journal of the European Economic Association, 3(2�3):      466�76. 10      Cribb et al (2014) find that women�s employment rates at age 60 increased by around 7 percentage points      when the state pension age was increased to 61. Male partners� employment rates also increased � by around   4                                                                                          BIS central bankers� speeches Reforms to the UK�s welfare system, including attaching job-search conditions to welfare payments, could have prompted those affected to seek work. 11 Sharp falls in wealth and increased uncertainty about future incomes following the financial crisis have undoubtedly changed many people�s retirement plans, making them work longer and retire later in order to compensate. 12 And the scale of the debt accumulated by Britain�s households in the run-up to the recession has encouraged more people to work, and to work longer. 13 Around 40% of households reported being concerned about their levels of debt in 2013. 14 Almost a tenth of households in a recent Bank of England survey said they were working more because of concerns about repaying their debt. So the strong performance of the UK labour market reflects in part people feeling compelled to work for financial or other reasons. When British workers have been challenged, they have not given up (Charts 5�8). Some have taken less productive or lower-skilled jobs. Others are working part-time. Some have become self-employed. Others are prepared to do the same work for less than they would have done. Wage pressures are, on past relationships, as low as if the unemployment rate were around 10%, not the 6.4% it is today (Chart 9). 15 With more workers at competitive wages, companies have been encouraged to hire. They already had reason to favour labour over new capital investment given the higher cost and lower availability of credit following the financial crisis. 16          4 percentage points � perhaps indicating a desire by couples to coordinate their retirement planning. Cribb, J,      Emmerson, C and Tetlow, G (2014), �Incentives, shocks or signals: labour supply effects of increasing the      female state pension age in the UK�, IFS Working Paper No. 13/03. 11      For example, out-of-work lone parents with older children must now claim Job Seekers Allowance, a benefit      with job search conditions attached, unlike previous Income Support. Consistent with these changes, Blundell      et al (2014) find that participation and employment rates appear to have increased strongly (by 8�9%) among      lone mothers who were affected by the 2010 changes. Blundell, R, Crawford, C and Jin, W (2014), �What can      wages and employment tell us about the UK�s productivity puzzle?�, The Economic Journal, 124 (May). See      also Avram, S, Brewer, M and Salvatori, A (2013), �Lone parent obligations: an impact assessment�,      Department of Work and Pensions Research Report No. 845. 12      Blundell et al (2014) examine the effects of the peak-to-trough wealth shocks implied by the financial crisis on      older workers� labour supply. They focus on individuals aged 55�74, and examine whether changes in wealth      help to predict future employment patterns in 2010�11 given employment status in 2006�7. They find      evidence that shocks to housing wealth helped to predict employment status. For example, compared to the      least affected 20% of men, the worst affected 20% of men were 14% more likely to be in work in 2010�1. The      authors caution against taking too strong an interpretation of their results, however. For example, the regional      house price indices used to calculate changes in housing wealth may be capturing wider regional variation in      labour demand. 13      Eggertson and Krugman (2012) illustrate how increased labour supply is one margin through which      households that need to de-lever can do so.

BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                      5 This substitution of labour for capital across the economy has continued to lower productivity per hour worked. That weak productivity growth is not the result of laziness on anyone�s part. It is a natural consequence of so many people wanting to work and companies employing them in place of capital. Since the typical economist asks whether what they have observed can work in theory, the annex shows how a �labour supply shock� results in a lower path for real wages and productivity, higher employment, and greater downward pressure on wage growth at any particular rate of unemployment. Although the adjustment has been painful, trading off lower productivity and wages for much higher employment, on balance it provides a solid foundation for a durable expansion. That is because keeping people in work through a recession maximises the prospects for individuals and the economy. By staying in work, individuals retain and learn new skills. And they are better placed to participate in the expansion when it gathers force. This can make a material difference to an individual�s lifetime earnings. 17 For the economy, maintaining workforce attachment is the best way to ensure that cyclical downturns in aggregate demand for goods and services do not translate into permanent reductions in our economy�s potential to supply them. As a result, Britain has an opportunity, not often seen after a deep recession, to reach and sustain a higher level of employment than in the past. And workers can maximise their pay prospects. But, you rightly ask, when will this start? When will Britain get a pay rise? The expansion of labour supply does not mean permanently weak growth of real incomes. As employment approaches its new higher level, wage pressures should increase and capital investment should continue to recover. Productivity growth should pick up bringing the higher, sustainable pay rises that British workers deserve. 18 Specifically, the Bank�s latest forecast expects real wage growth to resume around the middle of next year and then to accelerate as the unemployment rate continues to fall to around 5�% over the next three years. By the end of our forecast, we see 4% nominal pay growth on average across the economy. This is consistent with our inflation target and the economy�s potential. I will touch at the end of my remarks on how workers and employers can raise that potential. But first let me turn to the implications of all these labour market developments for monetary policy.    17      Oreopoulos et al (2012) estimate that a rise in unemployment by 5 percentage points implies an average initial      loss of earnings for new college graduates of around 9 per cent, an effect which fades only after a decade.      The persistent effects from adverse labour market conditions are much larger for individuals in the first year of      their careers than for those with a few years of experience. And losses are magnified for those whose      earnings are predicted to be lower, based on their college major. See Oreopoulos, P, von Wachter, T and      Heisz, A (2012), �The short- and long-term career effects of graduating in a recession�, American Economic      Journal: Applied Economics, 4(1), pages 1�29. 18      See Barnett, A, Batten, S, Chiu, A, Franklin, J, and Sebastia-Barriel, M (2014), �The UK productivity puzzle�,      Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Q2, for an analysis of the UK�s �productivity puzzle�. The standard view      has been that the UK has suffered from a collapse in the underlying growth rate of productivity. On that basis,      we would not expect there to be significant scope in future for either productivity or real wage growth. The      interpretation of the recent behaviour of the labour market as a labour supply shock has more positive      implications for the future.    6                                                                                            BIS central bankers� speeches 3.          Monetary policy implications One of our roles at the Bank of England is to deliver price stability in a way that supports jobs and growth. Our price stability objective is clear: the inflation target of 2% CPI inflation. Supporting jobs means helping the economy reach the maximum sustainable level of employment. That level changes as the economy changes. That is why, a little more than a year ago, even though inflation had been above the target for most of the past five years and economic growth was poised to accelerate, we did not raise interest rates from their historic low level of �%. We did not because we recognised that the UK had a huge number of unemployed and under-employed workers and that the economy was running below full capacity. We expected inflation to fall back. We saw that confidence might have been returning, but it remained fragile. We knew the nascent recovery was not yet secure. So we used the flexibility in our remit, given to us by Parliament, to return inflation to the target over a longer period than usual in order to support sustainable jobs and growth. To make our intentions clear, the Bank committed not to even think about raising interest rates from historic lows at least until unemployment fell back to 7%. That guidance gave businesses the confidence to hire and invest. It reassured households that the costs of servicing their debts were not about to rise abruptly at a time when they remained particularly sensitive to interest rates. And it evolved with the economy. The effectiveness of that policy has been reinforced by the healing of the financial sector. Prompted by the Bank of England, British banks have raised over �140 billion in new capital in the past few years. They are right-sizing their balance sheets and re-focussing their businesses. The recovery has exceeded all expectations. It has momentum. There has been a sustained and sharp fall in the unemployment rate to 6.4%. Over 800,000 jobs have been created in the past year alone. We expect robust growth of 3�% this year and 3% in 2015. The challenge now is to secure a durable expansion; to make sure the economy realises its full potential. What does that mean for interest rates? With many of the conditions for the economy to normalise now met, the point at which interest rates also begin to normalise is getting closer. In recent months the judgement about precisely when to raise Bank Rate has become more balanced. We have no pre-set course, however; the timing will depend on the data. Moreover, the precise timing of the first rate rise is less important than our expectation that, when rates do begin to rise, those increases are likely to be gradual and limited. Rates will go up only as far and as fast as is consistent with price stability as part of a durable expansion, with the maximum sustainable level of employment. For a variety of reasons ranging from the weakness in the euro area, to ongoing repair of household balance sheets, we are not expecting interest rates to head back to the levels seen before the Great Recession. 19 The actual path of interest rates will be determined by the evolution of the balance of aggregate demand and aggregate supply.    19      See, for example, the Box on page 42 of the August 2014 Inflation Report.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                   7 Before the crisis, monetary policy largely tracked developments in aggregate demand because the structural dynamics of labour supply and productivity growth were relatively consistent. 20 But in the wake of the crisis, the supply side of the economy has been anything but predictable. Originally, we thought the major uncertainties were centred on productivity growth. But as the Bank�s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has seen wages, employment and productivity evolve, we are increasingly of the view that there has been a material labour supply shock for the reasons that I have discussed. So we have been paying increasingly close attention to developments in the labour market. Our forecasts for the next three years, and hence our interest rate decisions, are based on key judgements that: �           the number of people participating in the labour force will continue to rise, reaching             64% of the population later in the year and continuing its upward trend of the past             decade; �           the unemployment rate that the economy can sustain without generating             accelerating inflation will return to where it was before the Great Recession (around             5%), and, at around 5�% now, is currently only a little above that; and �           there is scope for the average hours people work to increase further, reducing by             about half the current gap between actual and reported desired hours. In short, and unlike the US and euro area, the economy is likely to be able to sustain a higher level of employment than in the past. The uncertainty is less the direction of that development and more its magnitude. To assess that magnitude and its implications for inflation, we are tracking a range of indicators, including those of the prospective paths for wages and unit labour costs. Actual wage growth, at just 0.6% since a year ago excluding bonuses, is currently very weak. 21 However, there are some leading indicators that point to a modest pick up over coming quarters. For example, job-to-job flows have been increasing (Chart 11) and some surveys of pay growth have picked up more sharply in the last year. Although the relationship between these surveys and average wage growth has become less robust in recent years (Chart 12), they do offer encouraging evidence of better wage prospects for those changing or finding new jobs. Of course, the pay of existing employees needs to pick up as well. After all, what matters for economy-wide inflation is the average wage relative to economy-wide productivity. 22 To that end, we will be closely monitoring pay settlements that are bunched around the turn of the year and taking a steer from the pay of new hires as a potential leading indicator of broader pay pressures. Some observers have discounted the implications for inflation of the recent weakness of pay growth because it stems from the types of jobs being filled � a �compositional effect�. However, these are real jobs being performed by real people, and an increase in lower- skilled lower-wage jobs is one consequence of working-off the labour supply shock. We also   20      See Broadbent (2014). 21      According to the ONS AWE measure, pay excluding bonuses for employees in the economy as a whole was      0.6% higher than a year earlier. Including bonuses, pay growth was �0.2%. In the private sector, the      equivalent figures were 0.9% (excluding bonuses) and �0.1% (including bonuses). 22      It is the average of real unit labour costs across firms in the economy that matters for inflation.    8                                                                                               BIS central bankers� speeches need to be mindful of the possibility that it represents part of a longer-term trend towards job polarisation. What matters for inflationary pressures, irrespective of the type of job, is the relationship between wages and productivity, as captured by unit labour costs. Across the economy, wage growth is barely above productivity growth. Unit labour costs are currently soft (growing at only around 1% in the economy as a whole), are below the growth rate necessary to meet the inflation target, and indicate that there is further to go before we reach the new sustainable level of employment. In other words, there is still slack in the labour market that must be used up, and the recent revisions to the profile of UK output up to 2012 seem unlikely to change that assessment materially. That slack is wasteful. And if it were to remain, inflation would remain below the 2% target. The MPC�s current best collective judgement is that, while it has narrowed rapidly, this slack is broadly in the region of 1% of GDP. As this margin of slack continues to narrow, we expect wages to pick up slightly faster than productivity, and unit labour cost growth should increase, consistent with meeting the inflation target. However, the MPC expects it will take the better part of three years for this to happen. With inflation at 1.6%, continuing downward pressure from the appreciation of sterling, and with slack remaining, the current inflation environment is benign. But it will not remain benign if we do not increase interest rates prudently as the expansion progresses. Our latest forecasts show that, if interest rates were to follow the path expected by markets � that is, beginning to increase by the spring and thereafter rising very gradually � inflation would settle at around 2% by the end of the forecast and a further 1.2 million jobs would have been created. In other words, we would achieve our mandate. There is, as always, uncertainty about the future. But uncertainty does not mean stasis. You can expect interest rates to begin to increase. The exact path will depend on the economy. Our assessment will undoubtedly change as the economy evolves and policy will of course be adjusted if geopolitical events have a material impact on the outlook. If indicators suggest the economy is moving more slowly towards our goals, we will have learned that we are further from sustainable capacity. Prospective wage and unit labour cost growth will be weaker. Rates will go up later and more gradually. And should we see faster progress, prospective wage and unit labour cost growth will be stronger, which will suggest we are closer to maximum capacity and that the economy can sustain higher rates sooner. In all events, rate rises can be expected to be gradual and limited compared to the experience of the UK in the past.  4.          Conclusion We are under no illusions. The Great Recession was a calamity. Britain�s workers have borne many of the consequences. Our job is to ensure the economy achieves its potential and to maintain price and financial stability, for sustainable growth in jobs and incomes. But monetary policy cannot do it alone. Others � including trade unions, government and businesses � will determine the potential of this economy. You will ultimately determine the size of Britain�s pay rise.

2014-09-26	"Mark Carney: Putting the right ideas into practice Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries General Insurance Conference, Wales, 25 September 2014.                                             *    *    *  Introduction It is an honour to be invited to address you today. Insurance is at the core of the new Bank of England. As regulator, we are tasked with ensuring the safety and soundness of the UK�s insurance companies and the protection of their policyholders. To discharge these responsibilities, we draw on the entire resources of the Bank. Fully one third of our regulatory staff � over 200 supervisors and 50 actuaries � are engaged in supervising insurance companies. But that is just the start. Our supervisors are supported by hundreds of credit risk analysts, scores of monetary policy experts and macro-financial analysts. As a central bank with responsibilities for both monetary and financial stability, we have a view of both the asset and liability sides of your balance sheets. And as a highly active participant in global financial reform, we influence the measures that are reshaping the global system. In all of our actions, we recognise the importance of insurance to the economy. The UK insurance industry makes a major, direct contribution: �25bn to annual GDP and 300,000 high-paying jobs including many of the 14,000 members of the Institute & Faculty of Actuaries. It is a major exporter with about 30% of premiums earned overseas. And the Lloyd�s market underlines London�s status as a world centre for insurance excellence and innovation. But the economic contribution of insurance goes much deeper. By spreading and managing risks, it increases the resilience of corporations, investors and financial institutions. It makes entrepreneurship and trade more viable. And it safeguards companies and individuals from perils they could not otherwise shoulder. From a financial system perspective, insurance companies play a vital role in the efficient allocation of capital. By matching long-term savings and investment, it finances the infrastructure essential to build our economy. The long-term perspective of insurance companies diversifies the financial system and reinforces its resilience. The contribution of the UK insurance industry can�t be taken for granted � especially in a macro-financial environment that challenges traditional business models.  Challenges from the macro-financial environment Of course, relative to the recent past, the economic outlook is much improved. The UK has experienced the strongest growth in the G7 over the past year. Job creation has been the quickest on record. Inflation has fallen below target having been above for most of the past five years. With many of the conditions for the economy to normalise now met, the point at which interest rates also begin to normalise is getting closer. In recent months the judgement about precisely when to raise Bank Rate has become more balanced.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                   1 While there is always uncertainty about the future, you can expect interest rates to begin to increase. We have no pre-set course, however; the timing will depend on the data. Moreover, the precise timing of the first rate rise is less important than our expectation that, when rates do begin to rise, those increases are likely to be gradual and limited. Why does the Bank expect this to be the case? In part, because the headwinds facing the economy are likely to take some time to die down. Demand in our major export markets remains muted. Public balance sheet repair is ongoing. And a highly indebted private sector is likely to be particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates. Over the medium term, several dynamics are likely to keep rates lower than in the past. UK rates could be restrained by continued imbalances between global saving and investment, together with potentially lower rates of global productivity growth. Central banks can also be expected to accommodate with lower risk-free rates the higher spreads that are likely to result from new regulatory requirements. All of these factors likely mean that, even when spare capacity is used up, Bank Rate will need to be materially lower than in the past in order to keep the economy operating at its potential and inflation at its target. The Bank is well aware that a prolonged period of historically low interest rates could encourage other risks to develop. In the UK, the biggest risks are associated with the housing market, which is why last spring the Bank took graduated and proportionate actions. We are also alert to the possibility that financial markets may be mispricing risk. As the FSB concluded last week, �there are increased signs of complacency in financial markets, in part reflecting search for yield amidst exceptionally accommodative monetary policies. Volatility has become compressed and asset valuations stretched across a growing number of markets, increasing the risk of a sharp reversal.� In such circumstances, insurers� proven ability to look through such short term volatility is invaluable. Nevertheless, an abrupt correction in term and risk premia could have a sharp impact on the valuation of securities that are marked to market and reduce the effectiveness and availability of proximate hedging strategies. More fundamentally, by squeezing margins, persistently low interest rates challenge business models. Insurers feel this pressure on both sides of the balance sheet: through muted investment returns; and as long-term obligations to policyholders � most common for life firms but increasingly relevant to general insurers that have Periodic Payment Orders on their books � become more expensive in today�s terms. An understandable response would be to move towards less traditional types of investments � such as infrastructure; into new or more complex types of business � like telematics pricing; or into new geographies like emerging markets. All these strategies bring new risks that must be well understood and prudently managed. Low rates are encouraging inflows of external capital into sectors like reinsurance. In effect, a �soft cycle� in financial markets is reinforcing a �soft cycle� in insurance � a particularly problematic combination. More capital boosts market capacity, but can also test underwriting discipline.  Putting the right ideas to work As supervisor, the Bank of England is monitoring closely how these new risks are being managed and how your business models are evolving.    2                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches At the same time we�ll be implementing reforms. Reforms to promote a more resilient insurance sector without standing in the way of an effective insurance sector, and without imposing unnecessary impediments on your ability to evolve your business models in response to the challenges I described. To borrow the theme of this conference we will be �putting the right ideas to work�. Today I want to highlight three of them: �           Tailored, consistent and robust capital standards; �           Holding the right people to account; and �           Global standards for globally systemic insurers. With those right ideas, we are promoting a resilient, innovative insurance industry that supports the real economy.  Right idea 1: tailored, consistent and robust capital standards The first right idea is to implement tailored and consistent capital standards to ensure the safety and soundness of insurers. Resilience against unexpected losses requires risk-based capital standards and robust valuation practices. The UK�s Individual Capital Adequacy Standards deliver this and were one reason why the UK�s insurance sector weathered the crisis so well. The Bank of England wants the principles behind ICAS to be applied as widely as possible; to establish as level a playing field as possible. That is why we support Solvency II. It embeds across Europe the core principles necessary for sound regulation, namely: �           appropriate market-based valuation methodologies; �           a comprehensive measure of risk and solvency covering all group activities; and �           capital resources of an appropriate quality to absorb loss. Solvency II is the biggest change to insurance regulation in a generation, and it will be live in just over a year. While our shared history with ICAS means the UK insurance industry is relatively well placed, we must not underestimate the scale of the challenge. Even the standard formula, which nine out of ten UK insurers will use to determine their solvency requirements, is significantly more advanced than the Solvency I approach it replaces. Although more demanding, we have worked to ensure the standard formula does not impede your provision of long-term finance to the real economy. Steps have been taken to make Solvency II more accommodative of securitisation. And in parallel, the Bank of England has been working with the European Central Bank to remove other impediments to the revitalisation of securitisation markets, including pushing for revisions to regulatory requirements for banks and for the development of simple, transparent and consistent products. Where the standard formula is not a good fit for a firm�s risk profile, firms will be asked to consider developing a partial internal model; making an application for an undertaking- specific parameter; or adjusting their underlying business model. Many of you in this room are acutely aware of the demands of the Solvency II model approval process.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                   3 This rigour has a purpose. The dangers of using poorly designed models were made all too clear in the banking sector. So the Bank won�t hesitate to withhold approval of inadequate or opaque models. Models must be based on appropriate data and account for all quantifiable risks. Boards have the responsibility to ensure models remain appropriate and to show they are used in practice. Of course, risk-based capital standards are about more than models. Models can never be relied upon in all circumstances or in isolation, nor can they be substitutes for sound judgment. Solvency II recognises this in its three-pillar approach � supplementing a modernisation of the quantitative regime with new supervisory review, governance, risk management and transparency requirements. These requirements, under pillars 2 and 3, build a coherent framework for the future. Tools like scenario testing and the Own Risk Solvency Assessment are therefore fundamentally important. By thinking about the risks that could harm future solvency � and the possible responses to a stress � ORSAs promote the protection of safety and soundness of insurance firms, while providing insights into overall financial stability.  Right idea 2: a regime that holds the right people to account The step-change in regulatory standards under Solvency II has several implications for the industry. Risk professionals like yourselves have a central role to play in building models; in using expert judgment to marry quantitative and qualitative assessments of risk; and in making technical subject matter accessible to Boards. Your work will be vital to making these new standards a reality and thereby to establishing a stronger, more consistent standard of resilience across the EU. But amidst our work to embed new regulatory standards, it must not be forgotten that the responsibility for running insurers rests with their Boards and senior managers. This leads to the second right idea we are putting into practice: the people running insurance companies should be more clearly held accountable for their actions. It is now clear that in some parts of the financial sector, the link between seniority and accountability had become blurred or even severed. The Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards recognised this when they recommended a new regime for the senior- most managers in banks, ensuring their accountability. The principles underlying that regime are more widely relevant. Those individuals that run financial institutions should act with integrity, honesty and skill regardless of whether they work for global investment banks, regional building societies or in the general insurance sector. Solvency II recognises this imperative. It requires both firms and regulators to monitor the fitness and propriety of staff with key responsibilities in the insurance sector. As a consequence, the Bank of England is now working with other regulators to develop a regime for the key people in your industry. That doesn�t mean we are about to extend the banking regime indiscriminately. For one thing, unlike in banking, there will be no statutory provision for applying a �reverse burden of proof� in the insurance sector. In developing a regime tailored to insurance we will also have to consider the particular skills and roles that matter. This includes the central role of actuaries, which is one of the important    4                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches functions specifically recognised by Solvency II. In 18th century London, the title �actuary� was often interchangeable with that of Chief Executive. It�s your role in backing entrepreneurship with science; in ensuring premiums, reserves and capital are prudent; and in scanning the horizon for new risks and opportunities, that means we are minded to include both life and general insurance actuaries within the scope of our updated fit and proper regime for individuals in insurance. By including your profession in the new regime, we recognise the importance of your skills, the range of your contributions, and your personal propriety. Later this year we will consult on a regime that includes the most senior actuaries � alongside CEOs, Chairmen and Chief Financial and Risk Officers � in our senior managers regime, making them directly accountable for how a firm is run, for their decisions, and for their actions. These senior persons will be expected to prove their fitness to regulators before they take up a role, and the onus will be on them to ensure risks are understood, measured and properly considered.  Right idea 3: global standards for globally systemic insurers While much progress has been made on the home front, the focus of the global reform agenda since the crisis has been on putting a third idea into practice: common global standards for systemically important insurers. The goal of this work is to increase systemic resilience; preventing spillovers from the failure of an insurer to the wider financial sector and the real economy. Policymakers agree that traditional insurance activities need not of themselves be a source of systemic risk. Indeed, recent events demonstrated three reasons why insurers are better able to withstand crises than other financial institutions. First, the underwriting cycle is generally not correlated with the business cycle; Second, the inherent resilience of business models that take a long-term view, and Third, an insurer�s production cycle is inverted as they collect premiums today with a view to paying claims tomorrow. This model reduces liquidity risks and immunises insurers against risks of a run. Insolvency takes time to manifest, and wind-down when it happens has historically been more orderly. Given all that, you might ask: why the concern about systemic risk in insurance? The answer is simple: The financial crisis laid bare that the actions of some individual insurers � like AIG � can have broad spillovers; that some insurance markets � like the monolines � are systemic, and that the insurance sector plays a systemic role in diversifying the financial sector thereby reinforcing its resilience. AIG was the extreme case of a systemic insurer. That sorry experience highlights the need to understand all the activities in which insurers are engaged, including on occasion substantial business beyond the boundaries of traditional insurance. Regulators have grouped those activities as �non-traditional� and �non-insurance� � including business involving extensive use of market instruments, like derivatives, and instruments that engage in substantial maturity transformation. Where this type of business is carried out in scale or across borders, risks to the system can be substantial. The crisis also showed how particular insurance markets can affect systemic stability.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  5 The Monolines demonstrated how sub-sectors that are excessively concentrated or undercapitalised can amplify shocks. The failure of multiple insurance companies in response to economic stress can disrupt the provision of critical economic functions. It can also suddenly transfer risks to other parts of the financial system that may be ill-equipped to manage them; or shift assets around in a way that can amplify and spread distress. As I said previously, the insurance sector is systemic in a positive way. Insurance companies have different risk bearing capacities than many other financial institutions. They play a stabilising role by deploying funds over a longer time horizons, in a manner less vulnerable to sudden outflows. The resilience of large insurers is therefore important to safeguard that positive contribution to the global economy. The starting point for the application of global standards has been the identification of systemically-important insurers. More than four-fifths of that assessment rests on the extent of non-traditional non-insurance activities in a firm�s business model and on its interconnectedness to the wider financial system. Nine firms have been designated. It is vital that these systemic insurers, like systemic banks or financial market infrastructure, can be resolved in the event of failure without the need for taxpayer support and without disruption of the wider financial system. That�s why the development of resolution plans is a top priority. Nonetheless, given the externalities from the failure of a systemic insurer, it is of course preferable that their probability of failure is lower. That�s why systemic insurers will be subject to higher global standards. The Higher Loss Absorbency requirements, being developed now by the IAIS, will ensure that all of the activities of a systemic insurance group � but especially non-traditional, non- insurance activities � are backed with an appropriate minimum level of capital resources. Given the patchwork of capital standards across major jurisdictions, the first step towards applying these heightened resilience requirements is the development of the Basic Capital Requirement � an internationally comparable capital measure that will act as the baseline for additional resilience. Last week in Cairns, the FSB approved the final BCR proposal which will be presented to G20 Leaders at the Brisbane summit in November. It is simple and factor-based, contains a common valuation approach, and captures all activities of insurance groups. This is an important milestone � one that takes us further towards embedding the right idea of increased resilience for those few insurers that have the capacity to impact the global financial system. I look forward to your continued support as the IAIS builds on this progress to put into practice the overall package of requirements for systemic insurers by 2019. And we will need your support as we further develop, over time, an International Capital Standard to apply to all internationally active insurance groups. Our aim is nothing less than a standard which embodies the principles which underpin ICAS and Solvency II.  Conclusion The ideas I�ve described today are vital to preserving the positive role of insurance in the financial system and the real economy.     6                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches These ideas � tailored capital standards that promote a level playing field; a framework to hold the right people to account; and global standards for globally systemic insurers � are needed now in practice. The Bank knows that as our reforms are implemented and as your business models evolve we need a regulatory approach that is regularly reviewed, adjusted if necessary; and that takes account of evolving financial conditions, product innovation and changing markets. Robust interaction with the industry is essential to ensuring the right ideas can be put into action now, and for the future. The Institute & Faculty of Actuaries has been at the heart of the insurance industry for over 150 years, and the changes to regulation, the industry and the world around us mean your contribution is more essential than ever. Having the right people putting the right ideas to work has never been more important.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                               7"
2014-10-15	"Mark Carney: Regulatory work underway and lessons learned Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the 29th Annual G30 International Banking Seminar, Washington DC, 12 October 2014.                                              *     *   *  Six years ago when the financial crisis was in full force, the G7 met here in Washington. We backstopped our entire financial systems. The G20 then committed to its fundamental reform. The first objective was to fix the deep and varied fault lines that caused the crisis. We are now in prospect of substantially completing that job at the Brisbane Summit. Core financial institutions are more resilient. Effective bank capital requirements have increased seven-fold. Major banks are on track to meet these requirements five years in advance. And for the first time liquidity standards have been established. There have been fundamental changes to banks� relative incentives to engage in proprietary trading, market-making and lending, as well as restrictions on contingent exposures to off balance sheet vehicles, such as SIVs. Shadow banking is being transformed into resilient market-based financing. Minimum margin requirements have just been agreed for the repo market, and a variety of shadow banking institutions, including money market funds, have been reformed. Derivative markets are safer. Trading is now simpler and more transparent. Central clearing and trade reporting requirements are coming on-stream, backed up in over half of FSB jurisdictions by capital requirements and, from December 2015, margining requirements. Half of interest rates swap transactions are now centrally cleared.  Ending too big to fail Those are significant achievements but the job of fixing the fault lines cannot be complete without ending Too Big to Fail. Operating in a heads-I-win-tails-you lose bubble, the world�s largest banks threatened the stability of the global financial system. Their bail-out using public funds undermines market discipline and goes to the heart of fairness in our societies. This cannot be allowed to continue. It is essential that all systemically important financial institutions can be resolved when they fail: �           Without the need for taxpayer support. �           And without disruption to the wider financial system or real economy. Tackling the rampant moral hazard at the heart of the financial system hasn�t been easy. And our success can never be absolute. Specifically, we can�t expect to insulate fully all institutions from all external shocks, however large.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  1 But we can change the system so that systemically important institutions bear the cost of their own actions and the risks they take. After much hard work, and extensive cross-border co-operation, the FSB is on track to agree proposals that, once implemented, will be decisive in achieving that. The use of statutory resolution powers to resolve global systemic banks will finally be possible. The proposals will be presented to the Brisbane G20 Leaders summit in November. That Summit will be the watershed in ending Too Big to Fail. The first is an internationally agreed standard on the total loss absorbing capacity (or TLAC) that globally systemic banks must hold. It will be based on clear principles. But it will be much more than a list of aspirations. It will include a detailed indicative term sheet that will cover the amount; the type, and the location of that loss absorbing capacity. It will establish a level playing field between global systemic banks, while taking into account differences in national resolution regimes. It will ensure globally systemic banks finally have the quantum of total loss absorbing capacity that extensive analysis show balances the benefit of greater resilience against the higher funding costs for the banks that results from the removal of public subsidies. It will set clear roles for home and host regulators in a resolution. It will give host nations the confidence that they won�t again be side-swiped by the failure of a large foreign bank. And, by removing the implicit subsidy that systemic banks have long enjoyed, it will re- establish market discipline. Once implemented, it will make our financial systems more resilient and our economies stronger. The proposal will be subject to a rigorous consultation and Quantitative Impact Study and market survey in 2015 and will take into account insights from the FSB�s ongoing Resolvability Assessment Process for every systemic bank�s resolution plan. The TLAC agreement will be complemented by another agreement just announced yesterday. This initiative of the private sector sets out the terms under which the 18 largest dealer banks, which represent 90% of derivative activity, would stay cross-border derivative contracts temporarily when a global bank fails. This is a fundamental step to closing off the risk that foreign counterparties take their money and run. By agreeing to a short stay, cross border resolution becomes much more realistic and achievable. Once this agreement is concluded, other market participants must be brought onto similar terms to those of the 18 big dealers, and FSB members must deliver on their commitments to establish regulatory requirements for contractual stays. There is more to do. Resolution plans must be finalised; we must systematically remove remaining legal and operational impediments to resolvability, we must think through mechanisms to ensure firms have adequate funding in resolution, and we must ensure resolution regimes for systemic non-banks are as effective as they are for banks But make no mistake. Brisbane will be the watershed in our collective effort to end Too Big to Fail.    2                                                                            BIS central bankers� speeches Building an open, global financial system Fixing the fault lines behind the last crisis isn�t enough. The second objective of the G20�s efforts is to rebuild trust in an open, global financial system. Trust between financial institutions. Trust between regulators. Trust between industry and finance. And most fundamentally, trust between the public and the financial system. That trust is essential to maintaining a truly global financial system that integrates all major economies. Only that system can serve all economies. Only that system can support the investment and trade necessary for strong, sustainable and balanced growth in advanced and emerging economies alike. Trust can only be restored if completing one job isn�t equated with downing tools. Policymakers must now begin to look beyond how they will reform the core of the system to how they will regulate and supervise it. That approach has three elements. First, intensive co-operation. That is essential if national authorities are to continue to resist temptations to safeguard markets unilaterally through ring-fencing, compulsory subsidiarisation or extra-territorial application of domestic rules. Of course, national authorities need some scope to develop measures tailored to their own jurisdictions. Circumstances sometimes differ across jurisdictions, whether because of the stage of an economy�s development, its degree of integration into the world economy, or specific features of a local legal system. But the impact of these measures must be monitored closely for spillovers to others and � where there are not detailed international standards � authorities must resolve cross-border issues by applying the principle of deferring to each other�s rules where those rules produce similar outcomes. The second involves rigorous and transparent peer review and assessment processes. That commitment is vital not just to ensuring that agreed standards are being applied consistently, but also to allow policies to be adjusted where material unintended impacts are identified. Through such work we�ve already learned about unintended consequences, and are now addressing them. For example, we amended the liquidity coverage ratio to take into account unintended consequences under stress on core markets such as commercial paper and to clarify that liquid asset buffers are there to be used in times of stress. We changed the leverage exposure measure, for example by recognising that cash variation margins are effectively pre-settlement payment of the fair value of the derivative. In doing so, we reinforced banks� incentives to centrally clear their clients� derivative trades. In other words, we simultaneously reduced bank leverage while increasing the robustness of derivative markets.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  3 And we�ve learned about the unintended consequences of prudential capital and retention requirements on the securitisation market. Regulatory changes arguably treat asset-backed securities in ways that appear to be unduly conservative, particularly relative to other forms of long-term funding. Efforts to rebalance these incentives are now a priority. As the Bank of England the ECB have argued, there is a strong case for differentiating between securitisations that are simple, transparent and consistent, and those that are not. The regulatory treatment of those securitisations should reflect their lower risk profile. By making changes, policymakers are applying a mature approach. We�re learning and adjusting. We will continue to do so, in a thoughtful, open, and deliberative fashion. The third element of the new approach is turning our attention to new and emerging vulnerabilities. Work to assess new market developments and co-ordinate responses will become increasingly important as macroprudential risks arise from outside the traditional banking sector. In some economies, such as the UK, the biggest risks are associated with the housing market, which is why macroprudential actions have been taken. More generally, as the FSB has recently concluded: �there are increased signs of complacency in financial markets, in part reflecting search for yield amidst exceptionally accommodative monetary policies. Volatility has become compressed and asset valuations stretched across a growing number of markets, increasing the risk of a sharp reversal.� Those risks arise against a backdrop in which assets managed by investment funds have reached almost 90% of global GDP � more than two thirds the size of the commercial banking system. The growth of the asset management sector brings welcome diversity to financial intermediation. However, there must also be a focus, as there has been with banks, on the systemic risks it could create. Although the sector is becoming more concentrated, the risks don�t simply arise from the size of asset managers. They arise from the particular activities some in the sector undertake. The biggest risks arise from combining high levels of leverage with holdings of illiquid assets and commitments to provide liquidity at short notice. In the current environment, those types of activities need careful monitoring, and possibly a deliberate policy response.  Conclusion There is no doubt that the reforms made thus far, along with a stronger framework for global co-operation mean we are in a better position to face new risks. But as we move to the next phase of post-crisis regulation, many commentators find it tempting to succumb to world-weary arguments. That any reform will be arbitraged That any insurance will promote risk taking That there is a trade-off between stability and growth    4                                                                             BIS central bankers� speeches And that there will always be financial crises. We were right to reject such fatalism when we embarked on reform and we are right to reject it now. While all recognise that future crises cannot be ruled out, the steps taken in the past six years have certainly reduced the likely frequency and severity of such crises. Where banking systems have raised capital and restored trust in their creditworthiness, access to credit has returned. This central lesson from the US and the UK recoveries could not be clearer. Publicly provided insurance is being removed from the system as the Too Big to Fail problem is addressed and the public subsidy for globally systemic banks is eliminated. Market forces are being restored. The system is more transparent. It is clear who bears risk. And the scope for arbitraging new regulation has been reduced through a global approach to reform that has established common standards and encompassed shadow banking. In short, any serious look at the experience of post-crisis reform shows that reform and regulation support � not damage � long-term prosperity. As I said in Washington three years ago: in no other aspect of human endeavour do men and women not strive to learn and improve. The crisis showed that there was ample scope to improve the efficiency and resilience of the global financial system. Through clarity of purpose and resolute implementation Brisbane will mark an important milestone in our efforts. That we have reached this point is a triumph of the optimists. But we must not stop work. There is still much scope to improve. The process of reform is not over. We will continue to learn and adjust. And we must continue to manage the system effectively in the face of new risks. With that we can deliver the open and resilient financial system that can support strong sustainable balanced growth around the world.

2014-11-17	"Mark Carney: The future of financial reform Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the 2014 Monetary Authority of Singapore Lecture, Singapore, 17 November 2014.                                                  *     *    *  Accompanying tables and charts can be found at the end of the speech.   Introduction It is now more than seven years since the first tremors of the earthquake that was to rock the financial system in 2008. After the blood of the crisis, years of sweat and toil from authorities across the globe, and not a few tears from the financial sector, the job of agreeing measures to fix the fault lines on which the financial system had been built is now substantially completed. The financial system today is vastly different from its pre-crisis self. That change didn�t �just happen�: it is the intended, positive result of the G20/FSB reform agenda. The Brisbane G20 Leaders� summit just completed was a landmark. The prudential requirements and supervisory framework for banks are largely settled. There will be adjustments, if necessary, but from a prudential perspective, banks now know what they need to do. It is now a question of implementation. The result of the agreed reforms will be that: The system is safer. Banks were woefully undercapitalised � many of the largest banks were levered 40 to 50 times. They are now much more resilient. As banking systems around the globe implement fully the new framework, a system that was built precariously on sand will stand more firmly on rock. The system is simpler. Before the crisis, risks were hidden and financing chains were fiendishly complex. Banks were complacent, building business models on the belief that �this time is different� and assuming markets would be continuous and deep. They were enthralled by models to the extent that every bank that failed or was rescued by the state reported on the eve of their collapse that it substantially exceeded the Basel risk- weighted capital requirements. Now, disclosure standards have been significantly improved, contingent exposures are on the balance sheet, essential wholesale markets are more reliable, and capital standards are more robust. The system is fairer. Banks were in receipt of large public subsidies. In Brisbane we reached a watershed in ending too big to fail, with agreements to take forward proposals on total loss absorbing capacity for globally systemic banks. Globally systemic banks that fail will in future be resolved without recourse to the taxpayer and without jeopardising financial stability. Does that mean the job of financial reform is complete? No. Implementation must follow agreement. Our perspective cannot be only to look back. Just avoiding the repeat of past failures is not a recipe for success. Agreeing to measures to fix the fault lines is necessary and important, but not sufficient. We must now consolidate our progress to build a financial system that can deliver strong, sustainable and balanced growth for all economies: large or small; advanced or emerging; home to large financial institutions or host to them. Success would be a global financial system that maximises its full potential to ensure that: -           The payments infrastructure is efficient and reliable;   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                   1 -           Companies can access the working capital they need to operate; -           Liquid savings are transformed into long-term loans; -           Core markets function continuously to allow risks to be diversified and managed;             and -           Capital is allocated efficiently across the globe. Achieving these ends requires a financial system supported by three pillars: diversity, trust and openness. Building these pillars should be the focus of the future reform agenda. A diverse system, with market-based as well as bank-based finance, can best support a wide variety of investment from infrastructure to SMEs that is necessary to create the jobs our citizens deserve. A trusted system can retain its social licence to support the real economy in innovative and efficient ways. An open system can avoid the risk of Balkanised finance, which would reduce the efficiency with which savings are matched to investment and lead to a global misallocation of scarce capital. This is a daunting agenda and some might feel that, having apparently reached the finish line, the race has been extended. Indeed there will be inevitable calls by some vested interests to turn back. To give in, to drop out, would be a tragedy. The prize for running the longer race is great. By fixing the fault lines that caused the last crisis we have created strong foundations for a truly global financial system that can benefit us all. Now we must have the courage to seize that opportunity and build on those foundations. Today I will refresh the case for financial reform and set out what I believe should be the drivers of the future reform agenda. But before turning to that next stage, allow me to take stock of the immense amount that has been accomplished since the crisis.1  Completing the job of fixing the fault lines A safer financial system Banks are now much more resilient. They have more capital, more liquidity and are less susceptible to procyclical spirals. Capital requirements for banks are much higher, as are risk weights and the quality of bank capital. In all, new capital requirements are at least seven times the pre-crisis standards for most banks. For globally systemic banks, they are more than ten times.2 Large internationally active banks are on course to meet the new requirements 4 years ahead of the 2019 deadline. Despite the scale of the changes, the aggregate shortfall of those banks that still have shortfalls was �15bn at end 2013, having been �115bn two years ago. It is just as clear that banks� liquidity positions before the crisis were precarious.     1     A detailed progress report is contained in the FSB Chair�s letter to G20 Leaders ahead of the Brisbane Summit. See FSB     (2014b). 2     Table 1 shows that the tightening in definitions of risk-weighted assets and capital under Basel III itself doubled effective     capital requirements. The numerical requirements themselves have also more than tripled. Caruana (2012) describes these     changes in some detail.     2                                                                                                     BIS central bankers� speeches Now, for the first time, global standards have been agreed to place requirements on the liquid asset buffers banks must hold and on the extent of maturity transformation in which they can engage. The rapid contagion during the crisis showed how the system magnified shocks. Two particular fault lines made the system procyclical. First, banks were heavily exposed to movements in market prices and volatility around them, creating a cycle in which falls in prices caused banks to retrench and reduce their positions, leading to further falls in asset prices. That issue has been addressed through strengthening regulatory requirements on trading books � a move that has contributed to the share of banks� assets accounted for by trading assets almost halving.3 Second, banks and shadow banks were entwined in a dangerous funding spiral. Incredibly low initial margins on repo transactions facilitated the build-up of excessive leverage and maturity mismatches in shadow banks. The first wave of losses led banks to tighten margin requirements, effectively reducing financing available to the non-bank financial system, causing those institutions to deleverage through asset sales, driving a death spiral of falling asset prices and rising margin requirements. Such dynamics have now been mitigated through agreed minimum haircuts for securities financing transactions and the net stable funding ratio for banks.  A simpler financial system As the crisis highlighted, opacity hides frailty. Why was subprime not contained? How did $200bn in credit losses ultimately cause well over $1trn in market losses? Because complexity obscured the link between ultimate creditor and debtor, it allowed false assumptions to develop that, when disabused, prompted panic. The mortgage originated by a bank was repackaged by a SIV, that financed it through ABCP, that was bought by a MMF, into which a retail investor placed their savings. It occurred to no one in the chain that the absence of a monitor would influence credit performance. The whole model was based on continual rollover. When subprime losses exposed the misalignment of incentives between loan originators and investors in asset-based securities, the whole system collapsed, imploding core funding markets for banks. Risks that had ostensibly been moved outside the banking system or diversified away were in fact just hiding and, when crisis struck, they came crashing back onto the balance sheets at the core of the system. This complexity is being addressed. To protect against risks that banks think are low but are in fact not, a global definition of a simple leverage ratio has been agreed. In the UK, the Bank of England has just recommended powers to set a simple leverage ratio for domestically-regulated banks, building societies and investment firms. This will enhance the resilience of banks against risks that are hard to model.4 And it will ensure off-balance sheet exposures are properly capitalised.    3     Table 2 shows that the risk weighting of trading book assets has more than doubled. Despite accounting for only 5% of     overall risk weighted assets, trading assets contributed more than one third of the overall increase in RWAs resulting from     new regulatory requirements. Banks have responded by shrinking trading books. Chart 2 shows that across all advanced     economy SIFIs, the share of such assets on bank balance sheets has almost halved. 4     Chart 2 shows that, for more than a decade before the crisis, average risk weights declined and, as they did so, banks     increased leverage. This trend was central to the erosion of confidence in risk weightings. Since the crisis, average risk    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                                3 Retention and capital requirements for securitisations now have more closely aligned incentives between originators and investors. New requirements for money market funds have closed the gap between retail investors� perceptions and their exposures. International standards are agreed to capture properly and limit off-balance sheet exposures. And the Basel Committee is developing the capital framework to ensure implicit offers of contingent support by banks, for example to their SIVs, will be properly capitalised. Interconnections created by derivatives are being reduced and made transparent. Requirements are being imposed, and incentives created, for banks to centrally clear derivative trades, helping to replace the complex web of bilateral deals with a central model. Trade reporting and margining requirements are being strengthened. More broadly, overall disclosure has been enhanced on the key risks arising from business models, sources of funding, market risk measures and loan forbearance policies.5 Through such initiatives, complexity and obscurity are being replaced by simplicity and transparency.  A fairer financial system That goes some way towards increasing the effectiveness of market discipline. But that discipline will never be felt fully if markets believe that creditors and shareholders will be bailed out in a crisis because banks are too big to fail. Expectation of bail out was validated comprehensively last time. The US authorities sought to make Lehman Brothers a test case of moral hazard. Instead, this exception proved the rule. AIG was rescued within twenty four hours. As Barney Frank observed, the free market lasted for a day. This �heads-I-win-tails-you-lose� environment for the world�s largest banks struck right at the heart of the sense of fairness in our societies. It simply had to be fixed. Tackling the rampant moral hazard at the core of the system has not been easy but, at the Brisbane Summit, G20 Leaders marked a watershed in our efforts. Many jurisdictions have in place statutory regimes to allow the resolution of failing banks. But until now, the potential use of those regimes on systemic and cross-border institutions has been in doubt. G20 Leaders endorsed two proposals that will allow global systemically-important banks to be resolved when they fail, without the need for taxpayer support and without disruption to the wider financial system or real economy. The first is an agreement, catalysed by the FSB, between ISDA and an initial group of 18 global derivatives dealers. This new Protocol prevents derivative contracts being terminated disruptively in the event of a bank entering resolution. It is a crucial step to closing off the risk that foreign counterparties take their money and run. Most jurisdictions already have legislation that achieves this nationally, but for global banks national solutions aren�t sufficient. This new agreement fills the gap by extending the       weights have stabilised and the increase in leverage has been unwound. The Bank of England�s proposals are set out in     Bank of England Financial Policy Committee (2014c). 5     Much of this has been driven by the FSB and the joint public-private Enhanced Disclosure Task Force. Across the major     jurisdictions, the recommendations of the taskforce are more than half way towards full implementation. Banks in the UK     have implemented 95% of the recommendations. The latest progress report is in Banziger et al (2014).     4                                                                                                BIS central bankers� speeches approach across borders. Together with existing legislation that applies stays domestically, the ISDA agreement means that over 90% of the dealer banks� OTC bilateral trading activity will be covered by either contractual or statutory stays. The second initiative is yet more significant. It is a proposal for a common international standard on the total loss absorbing capacity that globally systemic banks must have.6 It will ensure that shareholders and creditors who benefit in the normal course of business also absorb losses when banks fail. It will establish a level playing field between global systemic banks, while taking into account differences in national resolution regimes. It will set clear roles for home and host regulators in a resolution. And it will give host nations the confidence that they won�t again be side-swiped by the failure of a large foreign bank. It will ensure globally systemic banks finally have the quantum of total loss absorbing capacity that minimises the costs of an unsafe banking system. And, by removing the implicit subsidy that systemic banks have long enjoyed, it will re-establish market discipline. This proposal will of course be subject to public consultation and comprehensive impact assessments. Markets and rating agencies are already adjusting to the determination of authorities to end too big to fail. Credit ratings for globally systemic banks have been downgraded to reflect the much lower probability of state support. Market prices suggest the implied subsidy has been substantially reduced as the expectation of public bail-outs dies away.7 However, we have more to do in order to make cross-border resolution the only expected outcome in the event an institution fails. The TLAC standards must be finalised next year and then implemented fully. Resolution plans for individual firms must be finalised and legal and operational impediments removed. Arrangements for the funding of firms in resolution must be put in place. Legislation must be enacted to allow regulators to give effect to the resolution actions of authorities in other jurisdictions. And the solution of the too big to fail problem in banks must be broadened to include all systemic institutions, including insurers and critical financial market infrastructures, through designation, more intensive supervision and standards for loss absorbing capacity. We recognise that our success can never be absolute. Specifically, we can�t expect to insulate fully all institutions from all external shocks, however large. But we can change the system so that systemically important institutions, their shareholders and their creditors bear the cost of their own actions and the risks they take.  The future of reform With a safer, simpler and fairer system in place, the FSB can begin to look ahead to how, collectively, we will engage in the next phase of reform and regulate and supervise the global system.     6     Clear principles and a detailed indicative term sheet covering the necessary amount, type and location of loss absorbing     capacity are now being consulted on. See FSB (2014a). 7     Chart 3 shows the implicit subsidy to the top 4 UK banks. At the height of the crisis it reached almost �140bn per year but     has now shrunk dramatically.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                                5 The foundations are laid. The next stage of reform should build a system that serves households and businesses to its full potential. Such a system must be supported by pillars of diversity, trust and openness.  Diverse Although banking remains the most important business by some margin, the increase in the relative price of bank-based intermediation has encouraged a shift towards market-based intermediation. Virtually all net credit growth since the crisis has been in bond rather than bank finance.8 Non-bank financial sector assets have grown by 130% over the past decade and are now equivalent to 120% of global GDP.9 Managed properly, that represents a welcome increase in diversity within the global financial system. If banking again comes under stress, these markets could act as a safety valve. For there to be diversity under adversity, the connection between banks and markets must be appropriately sized and durable. I noted how pre-crisis links meant that the collapse of subprime spilled over into the core of the system. The post-crisis connection must be wired differently, but not severed completely. Banks are needed to overcome the information asymmetries that prevent direct market access for smaller borrowers. But with the right standards an appropriate boundary between banking and securitisation can be drawn and financing capacity increased. With securitisation markets effectively closed, even in Europe where loss rates on consumer- related securitisations were one twentieth of those in the US, smaller borrowers are not being served by market-based finance.10 In response, the Bank of England and ECB are working to promote a sustainable model of securitisation that is Simple, Transparent and Comparable.11 In other words, one that allows banks to originate and distribute assets for which credit assessment can be most readily performed in the market. Simple, transparent and comparable securitisations will support improved calibration of risk weights and retention requirements for banks and prudential standards for insurers that Ravi Menon has advocated.12 Greater reliance on market-based finance will need to be matched with measures to ensure its resilience. The international community will need to shift focus to new risks and vulnerabilities, many of which will emerge outside the banking system. As Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam has noted, the safety of finance will depend �on whether we stay intensely alert to the risks of the future, including especially the risks we do not yet see or know, rather than focus only on preventing the last crisis from recurring.�13 The FSB has set up a broad-based network for information-sharing and reporting on the scale of shadow banking activity. This work is far from academic because, although you wouldn�t necessarily know from a reading of financial market indicators, these are riskier    8      Chart 4 shows that non-securitised loans continue to account for almost 30% of global financial assets. Corporate bonds      and securitised loans account for only 7%. Chart 5 shows that in each of the US, UK and Europe, the period since the crisis      has seen the stock of outstanding bonds move towards the stock of outstanding bank loans. 9      See FSB (2014e). 10      Chart 6 shows the post-crisis collapse in European securitisation issuance, which has been particularly concentrated in      residential mortgage-backed securities. 11      Bank of England and ECB (2014) is a consultation paper on the development of such a model of securitisation. The EBA is      also consulting on the same issue, see EBA (2014). 12      Menon 2013. 13      Shanmugaratnam (2013).     6                                                                                                    BIS central bankers� speeches times. There is a disconnect between developments in real economies and the degree of financial risk taking. It is particularly notable how the search for yield has compressed liquidity premia across markets. This is unlikely to be sustainable over the medium term because it exists against a backdrop of much-reduced market-making activity.14 Fundamentally, liquidity has become more scarce in secondary fixed income markets. It just appears that it hasn�t. The reasons for the changes are clear however. New prudential requirements have reduced incentives for banks to warehouse risk positions. Dealer inventories in fixed income have declined by 70% since the pre-crisis period, while the stock of fixed income assets outstanding has doubled. And the Value-at-Risk in banks� trading books has retreated to 2002 levels. The time to liquidate a given position is now seven times as long as in 2008, reflecting much smaller trade sizes in fixed income markets. In part the current liquidity illusion is a product of the risk asymmetries implied by the zero lower bound on interest rates, excess reserves in the system, and perceived central bank reaction functions. However, interest rates in advanced economies won�t remain this low forever. Once the process of normalisation begins or perhaps if market perceptions shift and it is expected to begin, a re-pricing can be expected. The orderliness of that transition is an open question. Certainly, conventional leverage and liquidity cycles � while dampened by reforms � can be expected to operate. High volatility, combined with lower prices, will tighten financing conditions, forcing some asset sales, dampening prices and increasing volatility further. An overshoot is possible. Some have argued there is an additional risk arising from pricing and asset allocations based on an illusion of liquidity. This could lead to �redemption risk� as detailed by Hyun Shin and others.15 Their argument begins with the observation that much of the shift towards market-based finance has been accompanied by an increase in assets under management. We know that almost half of the $70 trillion in managed assets globally are in funds that offer their investors redemption at short notice.16 At the same time, funds are investing increasingly in higher-yielding, less liquid assets. One example of this has been the exponential growth in �liquid alternatives�, giving retail mutual fund investors access to hedge fund-like strategies.17 The compression of liquidity risk premia suggests that investors are assuming any future withdrawals from funds will be conducted in an environment of continuous market liquidity and that the value of their fund holdings will not fall substantially when they exit. The risks to that assumption are in only one direction. The dynamic that fund under-performance tends to be punished with outflows creates the possibility of the sorts of spirals that were previously associated with leveraged investors. That potential procyclicality is reinforced by the selling of volatility-linked products by funds seeking to boost income through insuring tail risks.     14      Chart 7 shows model-based estimates of liquidity premia across corporate bond markets. On these measures, premia have      returned to their pre-crisis levels. 15      Feroli, Kashyap, Schoenholtz, Shin (2014). 16      Chart 10 shows the increasing share of �redeemable funds� in overall assets under management. 17      Chart 11 shows the particularly sharp growth in assets under management in high-yield funds.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                           7 Although they were short-lived, the bouts of market turmoil in the past year have illustrated how there can be sudden and sharp outflows, particularly from high-yield and emerging market funds, resulting in illiquidity in the markets for those instruments.18 The macroprudential risk is that any revelation that continuous liquidity is illusory could generate potentially sharp changes in asset allocation. With net credit creation being largely reliant on bond finance, such a reallocation could generate a sharp deterioration in credit conditions for corporates and the risk may be particularly pronounced for cross-border flows to emerging markets. But what, beyond talking about it, can be done about this risk? Managing the risks in markets will require global co-ordination. The FSB provides the platform for authorities to monitor, analyse and address risks in a timely way. It brings all the relevant bodies together to develop this substantial body of work. Anticipating and managing market risk channels will be core to the future financial reform agenda. This point is relevant to work, currently underway, to develop a framework for identifying globally systemic non-bank non-insurer financial institutions. The fund management industry has become more concentrated, with the top 10 firms now accounting for almost one fifth of assets under management. However, size will not necessarily be the best indicator of systemic importance. It seems plausible that large unlevered funds with little maturity mismatch could pose few systemic risks. At the same time, smaller funds could be systemic if clusters of them conduct similar activities that do pose risks. Those activities include concentrated investments in illiquid assets, the potential for large short-term redemptions, and leverage, whether financial or embedded. As such, there may be merit in this activity-based systemic risk assessment over and above a purelyfirm-focussed approach to systemic designation. Of course, identifying systemic firms is just the first step in managing risks to global stability. To manage those risks, authorities can do more to work with market intermediaries to enhance transparency and understanding around secondary market liquidity. Securities market regulators may have an important role to play in developing globally- consistent best practices in liquidity risk management and valuations. Liquidity buffers and redemption schemes should be assessed. And greater standardisation of debt securities will also need to be supported. The need to ensure resilience in the non-bank financial sector also raises questions about the nature of central bank operations. The maintenance of an effective monetary transmission mechanism now requires backstops for both banks and markets. Bagehot will need to be updated for the 21st century, with central banks standing ready to operate frequently, against a wide range of collateral and a broader range of counterparties. In short, diversity will reap rewards, but resilient diversity will require a significant programme of reform and alertness to new risks.  Trusted The second pillar of the future of reform is to rebuild trust in finance. Trust between institutions, counterparties and investors is central to maintaining the ability of finance to function. Trust between regulators across jurisdictions is needed to maintain an open global system.   18      Chart 12 shows the sudden and sharp reversals of flows into US high-yield bond funds and sets those flows in the context of      funds� liquidity buffers.     8                                                                                                    BIS central bankers� speeches And most fundamentally, trust between the public and the financial system is needed to maintain the social licence for finance to operate. It has been severely tested by: taxpayer bail-outs of systemic institutions; rewards perceived as undeserved; a perception that clients have become counterparties; and egregious examples of misconduct and rigging of markets. Without that licence, the door will be opened to a level of regulation that constrains the ability of finance to innovate and support growth and trade efficiently. The licence will require consistent exemplary behaviour, and finance to have a clear sense of its purpose not as an end in itself, but as a means to promote investment, innovation, growth and prosperity. It is not merely that we should want to follow Churchill�s wish to see �finance less proud and industry more content�. We want to see industry content and finance taking justifiable pride in its contribution to society. That is far from straightforward when, even six years on from the crisis and public bailouts, triggers for public opprobrium are plentiful. Last week, the UK�s Financial Conduct Authority, US CFTC and Swiss FINMA fined six banks $3.3bn for misconduct in FX markets: misconduct that went on long after banks had already been fined for abusing interbank interest rate benchmarks. The repeated nature of these fines demonstrates that financial penalties alone are not sufficient to address the issues raised. Fundamental change is needed to institutional culture, to compensation arrangements and to markets.19 As Bill Dudley and my colleague Minouche Shafik have argued, the succession of scandals mean it is simply untenable now to argue that the problem is one of a few bad apples. The issue is with the barrels in which they are stored.20 Leaders and senior managers must be personally responsible for setting the cultural norms of their institutions. But in some parts of the financial sector the link between seniority and accountability had become blurred and, in some cases, severed. The public were rightly angered that so many of the leaders and senior managers who were responsible for sowing the seeds of the crisis and for allowing cultures to develop in which gross misconduct took place have walked away from their actions or inactions. In the UK, Parliament has established a stronger regulatory framework to allocate responsibilities to individual executives and board members and to give regulators the tools to hold them to account. The excuse of having delegated a responsibility simply will not wash. The public bail outs and the fact that few of the consequences of scandal have been borne by those who were directly responsible revealed a great deal about the balance of risk and rewards for those who worked in in financial services. Compensation schemes overvalued the present and heavily discounted the future, encouraging imprudent risk taking and short-termism. To align better incentives with the long-term interests of the firm � and, more broadly, society � major changes have been made. At the request of G20 Leaders, the FSB has developed principles and standards for sound compensation practices.     19      Chart 13 shows the sharp increase since 2010 in the number of FICC-related misconduct fines. The number of fines levied      on 12 November alone amount to almost three quarters of the number levied in 2013. 20      See Dudley (2014) and Shafik (2014).     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                             9 In the UK, we have introduced a remuneration code prescribing that payment of bonuses must be deferred for a minimum of three years and, after payment, be exposed to clawback for up to seven years. Bonuses can be reduced � or clawed back � if evidence emerges of employee misconduct or failures of risk management. We are consulting on extending deferral periods, widening the scope for groups of employees to have their bonuses reduced where there are more pervasive issues of performance or risk management, and considering options to prevent individuals side- stepping"
2015-01-29	"Mark Carney: Fortune favours the bold Lecture by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, to honour the memory of The Honourable James Michael Flaherty, P C, Dublin, 28 January 2015.                                                       *     *     *  1.          Introduction It is a pleasure to be in Dublin and an honour to give this Iveagh House lecture in memory of Jim Flaherty. Jim�s attitude and actions typified the Flaherty family motto: Fortune Favours the Bold. Born the sixth of eight children in La Chine, Quebec; Jim Flaherty worked odd jobs and won a hockey scholarship to put himself through Princeton. Successful in private and public sectors; he rose to become Attorney General and Minister of Finance of his province before becoming Canada�s 37th Minister of Finance. Once there, his accomplishments were legion, ranging from creating and enhancing support programs for the disabled and care givers to setting the country back on the path to fiscal balance after the crisis and ensuing recession. His tenure as Canadian finance minister was shaped by that crisis and its aftermath. It was my honour to work with him as Canada weathered the storm. And many of you worked closely with Jim as Ireland negotiated agreements with the Troika and devised policies to rebuild its battered economy. I am confident he would be proud of the progress Ireland has made. I suspect he would be more than a little frustrated with the euro area, however. To his last days he remained unconvinced that Europe had fixed its problems, often berating colleagues at the G20 for the lack of progress. That was typical. Jim Flaherty was always forthright. He wouldn�t avoid a problem, hoping it would get better. On current projections it will take the euro area eight years to achieve the recovery that Canada secured in two. Tonight I would like to draw on Jim�s legacy to reflect on how the euro area could act to avoid another lost decade. This matters for Ireland, Europe and the UK. The euro area is the world�s second largest economy. 1 With 27% of global banking assets it is a key determinant of global financial stability. It is the UK�s largest trading partner and the single largest destination for UK foreign direct investment. The euro area would do well to live up to the Flaherty motto because, although there was monetary boldness last week, the currency union has been relatively timid in putting in place the other policies and, crucially, the institutions necessary to deliver sustainable prosperity for its citizens. Now is not the time for half measures. In all advanced economies, private investment is still being held back by a combination of modest demand prospects and lingering concerns of another major adverse shock. Nowhere are these impediments more severe than in the euro area. Since the financial crisis all major advanced economies have been in a debt trap where low growth deepens the burden of debt, prompting the private sector to cut spending further. Persistent economic weakness damages the extent to which economies can recover. Skills and capital atrophy. Workers become discouraged and leave the labour force. Prospects decline and the noose tightens.     1      At market prices. In PPP terms it is third largest after China and the US.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                     1 As difficult as it has been, some countries, including the US and the UK, are now escaping this trap. Others in the euro area are sinking deeper. This relative performance underscores the importance of policy and institutions, particularly those that share and transfer risks. Building institutions at a time of reform fatigue may not be easy, but it is essential. Before I draw out this crucial point, I would like to quickly review how we got here.  2.          Setting the debt trap  Building the debt that now weighs on our economies was the work of a generation. In the decade before the crisis, private financial balances became unsustainable. UK households borrowed 4% of GDP year after year; Irish households at more than twice that rate. Household debt peaked close to 100% of GDP in the UK, and 120% in Ireland. 2 This borrowing was largely for consumption and real estate investment rather than businesses and projects that would generate the earnings necessary to service those obligations. Property prices soared as a result (Chart 1). Such excesses were possible because a decade of non-inflationary, consistent expansion turned initially well-founded confidence into dangerous complacency. Beliefs grew that globalisation and technology would drive perpetual growth, and that the omniscience of central banks would deliver enduring stability. With a growing conviction that financial innovation had transformed risk into certainty, underwriting standards slipped from responsible to reckless and bank funding strategies from conservative to cavalier. Financial innovation made it easier to borrow. Bonus schemes valued the present and discounted the future. Banks operated in a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose bubble and were capitalised for perfection. And a steady supply of foreign capital from the global savings glut � and in Ireland�s case, the initial euphoria of European Monetary Union � made it all cheaper. When the Minsky moment finally struck, debt tolerance decisively turned and the kindness of strangers evaporated. UK households swung from borrowing 4% of GDP annually to saving 2% of GDP. The comparable swing in Ireland was more than twice as large. 3  In the wake of the crisis, three truths came back to the fore. First, while asset prices rise and fall, debt endures. Second, the distribution of debt and assets matters. And third, it is very hard to reduce high debt in one sector or region without at least temporarily increasing it in another.  The debt tail is wagging the market dog. These realities continue to weigh on the European financial system. It is often argued that the world is awash with liquidity and excessive risk taking. And yet the rain is falling unevenly on the plain leaving some regions parched and others sodden. Savings aren�t flowing freely to the areas that need them the most. This is certainly true in the euro area, where many savings are trapped and much of finance remains fragmented.   2      While UK corporates accumulated debts to rival their household counterparts, Irish corporates surpassed that      with debt rising beyond 200% of GDP. 3      The UK and Irish private sectors swung dramatically into surplus (Charts 2 and 3).    2                                                                                         BIS central bankers� speeches The result is demand compression, weighing on the outlook for growth and sustaining fears that another major adverse shock is possible. Risk appetite is more fleeting than median growth forecasts suggest. The constellation of asset price moves since last summer bears this sober assessment out. Yields on sovereign bonds have fallen across all maturities. France hasn�t borrowed this cheaply since the �50s � the 1750s. Real rates are negative as far as the eye can see, suggesting perpetually anaemic growth. 4 In the past six months, estimates of the equity risk premium have risen by over 100bps in the UK and the euro area back to levels last seen in the heart of the crisis. 5 In addition, the probability of large declines in equity prices implied by options prices rebounded during 2014. This all suggests that investors may be attaching some probability to very bad outcomes, possibly the tail risk of economies becoming stranded in a debt trap. This market view is mirrored in elevated corporate caution. Investment remains subdued and businesses continue to build cash in many advanced economies. 6 This is one reason why the so-called �equilibrium� real interest rate is negative in many advanced economies, though it has risen and is possibly now positive in others like the UK. 7 Reflecting these real dynamics, central bank interest rates have had to be set at extraordinarily low levels and supplemented by large scale asset purchases simply for monetary policy to remain neutral. 8 Escaping a debt trap requires a suite of measures including structural reforms to boost productivity. But above all an economy needs to be able to channel all available savings � household, corporate and foreign � to those sectors willing and able to spend. In many respects, recent progress in the UK shows how.  3.          How the UK is escaping its debt trap In recent years, the UK economy has shown increasing signs of normalisation. Non-financial private debt has fallen by around 30% of GDP since its peak, the economy has grown consistently above trend, and unemployment has fallen from a peak of 8.5% to less than 6% today. This performance underscores several structural features necessary to escape a debt trap. The first is an integrated financial system which channels savings from one part of the economy to investment in others. Since the near collapse of the UK banking system, bold steps have since been taken to shore up its resilience. �140 billion of new bank capital has     4      Term premia, which measure investors� compensation for holding long- rather than short-maturity claims, are      also estimated to have declined since last summer, perhaps reflecting growing expectations for central bank      asset purchases. 5      For the UK, December 2008; and for the euro area, June 2012. 6      The non-financial corporate sector was a net saver in Germany, Ireland, Spain, Greece and the UK at end      2013, based on Eurostat data (ESA 95 basis). 7      The �equilibrium� rate of interest is that which equates demand with potential output, thereby delivering      inflation at target in the absence of �cost-push� shocks. 8      As my colleague Ben Broadbent recently said, central banks aren�t the cause of low interest rates, but rather      are actors reading a script written by others, Broadbent, B (2014), �Monetary policy, asset prices, and      distribution�, speech at the Society of Business Economists Annual Conference.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                   3 been raised in recent years, and banks� performance in the recent UK stress test suggest growing confidence in the resilience of the system is merited. 9 Second, the UK�s fiscal policy framework helps insure against severe systemic shocks. The UK had the space to allow its automatic stabilisers to cushion the impact of the recession. With the deficit rising to a peak of more than 10% of GDP before steadily consolidating, fiscal policy effectively recycled elevated private savings and built a bridge to the period when private balance sheets were repaired and confidence returned. Fiscal stabilisers also play an important role in sharing risks across individuals, sectors and regions, thereby reinforcing the resilience of the UK�s currency union. 10 A powerful demonstration of this comes with the recent sharp fall in global oil prices. Because this risk is shared across the entire UK (which on the whole is a net beneficiary of lower oil prices), the net impact on the Scottish public finances is a mere one tenth of what it would have been if there were no risk sharing. 11 There are few clearer illustrations of the benefits of sound fiscal arrangements in a currency union. Third, the UK economy is open and flexible. With a high degree of openness � its imports and exports summing to 60% of GDP � and a flexible exchange rate, the UK has a safety valve that can be used to recycle surplus savings to the rest of the world without driving down domestic demand, wages and prices. The 25% depreciation of sterling that took place in the wake of the global crisis helped smooth the path of adjustment, and also meant a �mark-to-market� gain to the tune of over �500bn on the UK�s external balance sheet. 12 The UK labour market is also highly flexible. The fall in real incomes caused by the depreciation of sterling was absorbed by employees, effectively purchasing faster job creation. 13 In addition, large inflows of foreign capital � now financing a current account deficit of 6% of GDP � mean spending and investment are higher than would otherwise be possible. This underscores the value of the UK maintaining its attractiveness as an investment destination through a competitive tax system, deep human capital, a flexible economy and ready access to a wide range of markets. Finally, the UK has a highly credible monetary policy framework. The UK�s inflation target of 2% is symmetric: we care about inflation below the target as much as above.    9      With other reforms to further the fairness and effectiveness of market-based finance, and major steps taken      towards end Too-Big-To-Fail, the UK is also on track to ensure greater risk-sharing between its creditors and      debtors. 10      It is estimated that on average around a fifth of variation in regional personal income relative to the national      average is stabilised by central government transfers. Estimates reported in Melitz and Zumer (2002),      �Regional Redistribution and Stabilization by the Center in Canada, France, the UK and the US: A      Reassessment and New Tests�. Journal of Public Economic, 86, pp. 263�286. 11      The geographical share of North Sea oil revenues, estimated by the Scottish Government, was 84.2% in      2012�3, down from 92.9% in 2008�9. In 2012�3, Scotland�s per capita share of North Sea oil revenues was      estimated by the Scottish Government to be 8.2%. See tables 4.4 and 4.5 of Scottish Government (2014),      �Government expenditure and revenue, Scotland 2012-3�. 12      Exchange rate effects alone led to an improvement of �573 billion to the UK�s net international investment      position between 2006 and 2008, estimated in Whittard (2012), �The UK�s External Balance Sheet � The      International Investment Position (IIP)�, ONS, March. 13      See Carney (2014), Speech at the 146th Annual Trades Union Congress, Liverpool.    4                                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches Our remit recognises that the inflation rate may, on occasion, depart from the target and that attempts to keep it at the target may cause undesirable volatility in output. That flexibility and focus meant that the Bank�s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) could provide additional stimulus through historically low interest rates, large scale asset purchases and monetary policy guidance even when inflation was temporarily above target. Inflation has recently dropped sharply to 0.5% � equalling its lowest rate on record. So next month I will write the first open letter from a Bank of England Governor to a Chancellor explaining why the inflation rate is too low and what we are going to do about it. The why is relatively straightforward. The majority of the weakness is caused by sharp falls in commodity prices, most notably oil, which has suffered its third largest fall in the past half century. Lower energy and food prices are unambiguously positive for the UK. Temporarily low inflation will boost real take-home pay and help household finances. Commodity prices do not explain wholly why inflation is so low. Generalised inflationary pressures in the economy are also subdued. Core inflation measures are running at 1.3%. That is a legacy of a long period following the crisis in which unemployment has been high and wage growth muted. 14 With additional falls in petrol prices in the pipeline, inflation is likely to fall further over the coming months and turn slightly negative for a period. It should pick up again in twelve months or so as the direct effects of a lower energy price drop out of the inflation rate. The Bank has the means, will and responsibility to return inflation to the 2% target within the next two years. That is consistent with the average horizon over which the MPC has sought to return inflation to target following overshoots in the past and with the nature of shocks the UK currently faces. The UK economy is expanding solidly. Over half a million jobs have been created in the past year and there are signs that wage growth is picking up. Interest rates can be expected to begin to return towards more normal levels over the next few years. Relative to what we and the markets expected a year ago, that path of interest rate increases can be expected to be more gradual and more limited.  4.          What is needed in the euro area?  The challenges for monetary policy are much greater in the euro area than in the UK. Since the crisis, euro area nominal GDP has increased by a mere 5% in almost seven years. Consumer price inflation is already below zero. Core inflation has been running at or below 1% for over a year. This is potentially dangerous. Low nominal growth is intensifying the euro area�s debt burden (Chart 4). 15 The fear of stagnation is holding back spending and investment. The ECB�s actions last week were timely and welcome. They were also important not least because they removed any residual concerns about whether it has the will or means to meet its price stability mandate. By doing so, the ECB has reduced tail risks associated with the debt overhang to the extent monetary policy can or should.   14      Unit labour costs rose by 0.5% in the year to 2014Q3, and unit wage costs rose by 0.9% over the same      period, based on the MPC�s backcast for UK GDP. 15      Aggregate euro-area household debt was 61% of GDP in 2007 and stood at 64% in 2013. The corresponding      figures for non-financial corporates were 94% in 2007 and 100% in 2013 and 66% and 92% respectively in the      aggregate government sector.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                5 However, the ECB alone cannot eliminate the risks of a prolonged stagnation. These exist primarily because, in most respects, the current construction of the euro area is unfinished. 16 With limited cross-border banking in the euro area, savings don�t flow to potential investments. Euro-area corporates� cash balances have risen to the tune of �420 billion, or 3% of GDP, since the crisis, for example. Modest cross-border equity flows mean inadequate risk sharing. Moreover, by design, there are virtually no cross-border fiscal flows so fiscal space is separated from fiscal needs.  The burden of adjustment has been concentrated on efforts to improve competitiveness. Some of these efforts are entirely worthy. Boosting productivity reduces the burden of a debt overhang as extra supply creates extra demand and incomes. But that takes time, during which debt dynamics may become oppressive. Improved competitiveness will also support exports to the rest of the world, but it is unlikely to be decisive in a listless world economy. More important for a given country in the euro area is to improve competitiveness against other members via internal devaluation. As you know, this is not easy. 17, 18 Irish workers and citizens deserve great credit for the flexibility they have shown. Wages in Ireland fell by almost 9%. In Spain they rose by 3%. Even though Irish unemployment rose to painfully high rates, it peaked at only a little over half the rate reached in Spain. That flexibility, by keeping unemployment lower than otherwise, has undoubtedly helped to reduce the risk that high unemployment becomes entrenched and destroys future economic capacity. For three reasons it is no panacea, however. First, internal devaluations simply reallocate demand within the currency union. They do not boost aggregate demand in the euro area as a whole. Put another way, since competitiveness is relative, a solution for some cannot be a solution for all. Second, the degree of flexibility is not just an abstract economic choice; it is also a political one that determines the burden of risk sharing between labour, firms, and the state. 19 Third, internal devaluation always forces down nominal incomes for a time, regardless of the degree of price and wage flexibility. 20 In more flexible economies, these reductions are concentrated in wages; in less flexible ones, unemployment. Cumulative nominal GDP growth since the crisis has been no better in Ireland than it has been in Spain. And it is this     16      As President Draghi recently said, EMU is incomplete and there is unfinished business. See Draghi (2014),      �Stability and prosperity in monetary union�, speech at the University of Helsinki, Helsinki, 27 November 2014. 17      A truth laid bare by the large flow of people out of the Irish economy, overwhelmingly to economies outside the      euro area, since the crisis (Chart 5). 18      The only way to recycle surplus savings in peripheral economies has been to export them. But since      peripheral countries are not the average euro area economy, the euro exchange rate has not depreciated as      far as would be warranted for them alone. To move to running a current account surplus, they have needed to      undergo painful internal devaluation against the core countries of the euro area, by driving down demand,      prices and wages. The current account of Ireland has moved from a deficit of 6.6% of GDP to a surplus of      almost 6% today. 19      In this regard it is impressive that some suggest centralised oversight and influence over such decisions. See      Draghi (op. cit.) and Trichet, J C (2011), �Building Europe, building institutions�, on receiving the Karlspreis      2011 in Aachen, 2 June 2011. 20      Real incomes should eventually rise if structural reforms generate a productivity dividend.    6                                                                                            BIS central bankers� speeches weakness of nominal income growth that is so harmful in dealing with a debt overhang and creates the tail risk of stagnation.  So if increased flexibility is not sufficient, what else is required? The answer is to build the risk sharing institutions that are present in any successful currency union. This means financial integration and common fiscal arrangements. In other words, both private and public risk sharing. It is not realistic to expect the private sector to do everything the public sector will not. Before the crisis, the European financial system appeared in many respects to be highly integrated with cross-border bank loans amounting to more than a third of total bank lending. However, most of this was interbank loans, implicitly backed by the state. With many of the recipients being judged too big to fail during the crisis, creditors weren�t exposed to loss for fear of systemic damage. Since the crisis, cross-border banking lending has halved, and the ability of the European system to recycle the surplus savings of peripheral nations to other parts of the private sector has been severely curtailed.  The good news is that European authorities recognise the need to re-found the euro area financial union on the principle of risk sharing. The current fragmentation of the system stems in part from a collapse of confidence in financial institutions across national borders. The recent Asset Quality Review and stress tests conducted by the ECB represent a major step towards restoring that confidence. Close to �60billion of capital has been raised since January 2014 as a result. 21 The establishment of a Banking Union and Single Resolution Mechanism as well as implementation of the G20 proposal on Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) will help break the link between sovereigns and banks and establish greater risk sharing between creditors and debtors. When combined with improved resiliency of banks, more sustainable cross- border banking flows should grow with time. It is also welcome that the new Commission has advocated the creation of a Capital Markets Union to boost cross-border flows of market-based finance. Such a union would deepen the single market, could benefit all member states, and could promote much greater cross- border risk sharing within the euro area. Had the cross-border financing of deficit countries taken the form of equity rather than debt, firms in deficit countries would have been more robust and losses would have been dispersed. In addition, greater direct market-based debt financing could also help share risks. For historical reasons Europe has a much less well developed system of market-based finance, with banks dominating the provision of credit. 22 This need for diversity is one reason why the Bank of England and the ECB are working towards proposals to revive the European securitisation market. 23     21      See ECB (2014), �Aggregate report on the comprehensive assessment�, October. 22      In the euro area, banks have historically played an important role in financing the real economy. Banks loans      account for around 50% of firms� external financing, which is very different from the US where around 80% of      firms� financing comes from capital markets (equity and debt securities). 23      Had debts taken the form of corporate bonds or proper securitisations with real risk transfer, defaults by      borrowers in the periphery would have been passed to the creditors in the core and this would have meant the      financial system was more reliably available post crisis.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                   7 To achieve this, the significant home bias in equity investment within Europe will need to be reduced, through measures such as the removal of national restrictions on investments by funds, greater provision of cross-border borrower information and greater pre and post trade transparency of prices and investment terms. These reforms hold out some promise of helping to prevent a repeat of the crisis. Unlike banking union, they do not require institutional changes. They will benefit all member states in the single market. However, they will take time to design and longer to implement, and they will have no impact on the burden of the debt overhang that already exists.  For complete solutions to both current and potential future problems the sharing of fiscal risks is required. It is no coincidence that effective currency unions tend to have centralised fiscal authorities whose spending is a sizeable share of GDP � averaging over a quarter of GDP for advanced countries outside the euro area (Table 1). I have already discussed how parts of the UK have benefitted from fiscal risk sharing. The euro area also stands out from federal systems like the US, Canada and Germany. In those systems, the impact of localised shocks to income is reduced by between one tenth and one fifth by centralised fiscal transfers (Chart 6). Without this risk sharing, the euro area finds itself in an odd position. As the Presidents of the European Council, European Commission, Eurogroup and European Central Bank argued in their report, European Monetary Union will not be complete until it builds mechanisms to share fiscal sovereignty. Possible options for sharing fiscal risks range from a transfer union to a pooled employment insurance mechanism. The latter would appear to be an opportunity to combine the current enthusiasm for labour market reform with the longer term imperative to build elements of an efficient transfer union. And it would ensure risk sharing was based on cyclical, rather than structural, labour market positions. And what of short-term fiscal dynamics in the euro area? President Draghi recently underscored the importance of fiscal policy as a short term stabilisation tool as well as the difficulty of utilising it in the current imperfect union. Consider the following comparison between the euro area and the UK. In the euro area, the private sector continues to generate surplus savings of 3�% of GDP (Chart 7). Those must be recycled effectively to generate an expansion. The UK no longer faces that challenge. Its private sector is in balance. The euro area unemployment rate of 11�% is twice that in the UK. Gross general government debt in the euro area is roughly the same as in the UK and below the average of advanced economies. The weighted average yield on 10-year euro area sovereign debt is around 1%, compared to 1�% in the UK. And yet, the euro area�s fiscal deficit is half that in the UK. It structural deficit, according to the IMF, is less than one third as large. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, if the euro zone were a country, fiscal policy would be substantially more supportive. However, it is tighter than in the UK, even though Europe still lacks other effective risk sharing mechanisms and is relatively inflexible. A more constructive fiscal policy would help recycle surplus private savings and mitigate the tail risk of stagnation. It would also bridge the drag from structural reforms on nominal spending and would be consistent with the longer term direction of travel towards greater integration. It would be bold, and it would be favoured by fortune.   8                                                                             BIS central bankers� speeches 5.          Conclusion Jim Flaherty understood the importance of having a plan, and implementing it diligently and clearly. Not just because, as policymakers, that is our job. But also because in the absence of such a plan, businesses and households would shy away from the risk-taking we need for a sustained global expansion. Europe needs a comprehensive, coherent plan to anchor expectations, build confidence and escape its debt trap. That plan begins but does not end with the monetary policy boldness of the ECB. That plan includes difficult structural reforms, but cannot be wholly reliant on them. That plan requires greater private risk sharing via banking and capital markets unions. But that plan also needs to recognise that private risk sharing will never fully replace public risk sharing so that plan should include what every other successful currency union has at its heart: mechanisms to share fiscal sovereignty. As of this evening, progress on structural reforms in the euro area remains uneven. Cross border risk sharing through the financial system has slid backwards. Europe�s leaders do not currently foresee fiscal union as part of monetary union. 24 Such timidity has costs. I think we all know what Jim Flaherty would have said about that.     24      As President Draghi recently noted, �In other political unions, cohesion is maintained through a strong      common identity, but often also through permanent fiscal transfers between richer and poorer regions that      even out incomes ex post.

2015-02-27	"Mark Carney: One Bank Research Agenda � Launch Conference Opening remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Launch Conference for the Bank of England�s One Bank Research Agenda, London, 25 February 2015.                                               *   *    *  I am delighted to open the Launch Conference for the Bank of England�s One Bank Research Agenda � an ambitious and wide-ranging framework to transform the way research is done at the Bank. The Agenda aims to improve the coordination of our research across all policy areas, to make the best use of our data, and to cultivate an extensive research community that spans the Bank and beyond. The Bank of England has a single timeless mission: to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability. To borrow from Keynes, to deliver that mission we must study the present in the light of the past for the purposes of the future. And we must do more. Our default cannot be Keynes� �madmen in authority� distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back�. 1 We need contemporaneous and open collaboration between researchers and policymakers. This will require both changes to our research focus such as developing a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between microprudential, macroprudential and monetary policies as well as changes to the way that we perform research at the Bank, including the development of a more open, permeable and policy-driven approach. In short, we are aiming to transform research at the Bank to the same extent as the Bank�s responsibilities have transformed in the wake of the financial crisis.  Transformation of the Bank of England The central challenge of macroeconomic policymaking in the late 1970s and 1980s was the fight against inflation. In no small part due to my predecessors, particularly Lord King, we have today a regime for maintaining monetary stability that is both democratically legitimate and highly effective. It rests on clear remits, delegated by Parliament, sound governance arrangements to support independence, and effective transparency of policymaking. And it provides valuable lessons for the conduct of other policy functions. Despite these successes, in both theory and practice, a healthy focus on price stability had become a dangerous distraction. The financial crisis was a powerful reminder that price stability is not sufficient for macroeconomic stability. It exposed the convenient fiction that finance is a veil. And we were taught that the dynamics of lending markets are as important as those of labour markets for our shared prosperity. In response to these painful lessons, the Bank of England has been bestowed with enormous new responsibilities by Parliament. They now span monetary policy, macroprudential policy, and microprudential supervision. They include responsibility for the United Kingdom�s bank notes; its payments systems; oversight of financial markets infrastructure and resolving failed institutions. To help fulfil its mission the Bank has core roles in Europe, at the G20 and at the Financial Stability Board.   1     In Ch. 24 of Keynes, J M (1936), The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, Macmillan     Cambridge University Press.

It is our duty to exploit complementarities, synergies and economies of scope to maximise our impact by working together. To do so, we need research. And to some extent, research needs us.  The need for research The way central banks have sought to achieve their objectives � the practice of central banking � has frequently moved ahead of the theory of central banking. Theory, in turn, subsequently catches up, and enriches and refines practice. The history of central banking is replete with examples. Tacit knowledge has often been more instrumental in determining policy outcomes than insights from formal research. Sometimes this works, as in Bagehot�s �dictum� (to lend freely at a penalty rate against good Montague Norman�s �never explain, never excuse�. 2 Research has meant that some modes of operation, like Norman�s, have rightly fallen by the wayside. It has helped nuance others, like Bagehot�s. And it guides us as to which practices to retain, reinforce and enhance, and which should be discarded. The practice of monetary policy in the Great Moderation is another example. It informed theorising and research on Inflation Targeting. And, in turn, through trial, error and refinement, research has helped inform policy with empirical insights and workhorse models. In the theoretical space, this process led to Woodford�s dictum that in modern central banking very little else matters beyond expectations. 3 In contrast, the practice of central banking in a messy real world where people use various heuristics, including rational inattention, has shown the limitations of such logical extremes. Research showed how central bank transparency and accountability make essential contributions to policy effectiveness, in a way that is complementary to ensuring central banks have democratic legitimacy. That remains an important insight in the era of enlarged and empowered central banking. Practice moved ahead of theory; theory caught up and refined practice. And the effectiveness of policy improved as a result. The crisis has meant practice has once again leapt ahead of theory. During its depths, the lessons of history and insights from psychology were arguably more valuable than precisions of dynamic programming. Our workhorse models didn�t have financial sectors; meaning questions of financial stability were not even asked, let alone answered. A great deal of improvisation was required to avoid a second Great Depression. It is vital that we draw on the experience from the crisis to rethink the way we understand the economy, the financial system, and the institutions we supervise. To do so, we need not only to study recent history more deeply but also to apply formal methods to refine our depictions of economic dynamics, as well as the policy tools we have to shape those dynamics in socially desirable ways. We need to catalyse thinking on new approaches towards policies that have assumed greater importance since the crisis from macroprudential policy to bank resolution.    2     See Bagehot, W (1873), Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market; and Boyle, A (1976), Montagu     Norman: A Biography, London: Cassell. 3     See Woodford, M (2005), �Central bank communication and policy effectiveness�, NBER Working Paper     No. 11898, December.    2                                                                                   BIS central bankers� speeches At the Bank of England, our enhanced research function, including a new Research Hub, will bring together staff and thinking from across the institution creating a two-way flow between research and policy. It will seek to foster a shared understanding of the frontier of policy possibilities amongst colleagues and ensure that the insights gained in one policy arena can benefit others. But these efforts will not succeed if they are confined to the corridors of Threadneedle and Moorgate. The Bank recognises that we need to do more to reach out to the wider research community. Policymaking can benefit tremendously from advances in all fields of economics and finance; from psychology to epidemiology; from computer science to law. That is why I am pleased to see such a diverse range of discussants and attendees at the conference today. In order to focus the conversations we are being clear about the key questions that interest us, as policymakers, the most. Let me now turn to those. Our One Bank Research Agenda is structured around five themes which span all aspects of central banking. The themes are broad. That reflects the diversity of our agenda. They focus on the interactions and intersections between policy areas. They emphasise new challenges and new directions, while recognising that familiar questions facing central banks remain no less important. Today�s conference is organised around them.  The first theme covers �policy frameworks and interactions� The re-emergence of macroprudential instruments as part of the policy armoury raises fundamental questions about the interaction of monetary policy, macroprudential policy, and microprudential policy. It is essential to improve our understanding of the relationship between credit cycles and systemic risks. Since credit market developments both affect and reflect potential growth in the broader economy, they � and macroprudential measures to influence them � require careful study by financial and monetary policymakers alike. The advent of a new, enhanced policy toolkit raises vital questions about the effectiveness of individual policy tools; their joint operation; and how they interact domestically and across borders.  The second theme covers �evaluating regulation, resolution, and market structures� The financial crisis precipitated a radical overhaul of the approach towards regulation, supervision and resolution. Regulatory policies have shifted from a near-exclusive focus on microprudential resilience to a more balanced emphasis on minimising systemic risk. In the whirlwind of essential change, there has been, however, relatively little assessment of the overall effect of reform on the financial system as a whole. Moreover, our understanding of the �system� must extend well beyond the banking sector to encompass the whole of market-based finance. The interplay between the reform process and the changing nature of financial intermediation also raises fundamental questions about how incentives and market structures might evolve and what policy might need to do to keep up.  The third theme covers �Policy operationalization and implementation� The practice of central banking constantly underscores that implementation and communication of policy can be as important as its design. During the crisis central banks around the world made extensive and imaginative use of their balance sheets in pursuit of their objectives.   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                3 This extraordinary range of policy responses provides an unparalleled opportunity to take stock of what worked, and why. As Ben Bernanke observed �the trouble with QE is it works in practice, but it doesn�t work in theory.� Understanding better the transmission mechanisms of QE, and the extent to which they are state dependent, can provide enormous insights to its effectiveness as a policy tool specifically, as well as the formation of agents� expectations and the functioning of financial markets more generally. Recent innovations have not been confined to new tools. As I noted previously, better communication and greater transparency has also made policy more effective. Transparency has taken centre stage as policymakers sought to restore confidence in the financial system, as they conducted and published stress test results to create more transparently resilient banks; and as they gave guidance to clarify their reaction functions. Recently, research informed the recommendations of the Warsh Review into what we could do to enhance monetary policy transparency here at the Bank of England. This research theme continues in that vein by asking what more might be done to enhance effective transparency in all areas of policy.  The fourth research theme covers �New data, methodologies and approaches� Increasing amounts of data � structured and unstructured, current and historical � are available on almost every aspect of the economy and the financial system. That holds great promise. Computing power has transformed our economies; it needs now to be harnessed to transform our understanding of them. Theoretical and methodological techniques continue to advance. In some cases that will mean measurement ahead of theory. That is one way to advance. In the short term, a black box could be better than none, and with time the patterns it reveals could prompt a greater understanding of the underlying forces. Recall that Kepler needed to uncover the empirics of planetary motion before Newton could conjure the theory of celestial mechanics. It is important to exploit developments in advanced analytics of large data sets to formulate better policy. They�ll improve our understanding of household and corporate behaviour, the macroeconomy and risks to the financial system. They need to be harnessed to enhance our forecasting and stress testing capabilities. To complement this theme, we will release historical data sets including detailed breakdowns of the Bank�s inflation expectations survey, our Agents� company visit scores, and very long back-runs of key economic and financial variables. This is one of the ways we will look to increase the permeability of our research. We are seeking also new ways to visualise and analyse the increasingly rich information sets that are available.  The fifth and final research theme covers the �Response to fundamental changes� Fundamental technological and structural trends will have a significant bearing on economic dynamics. Although they are likely to play out over a period that is longer than the Bank�s typical policy horizon, these trends will have profound implications for central banks. They include changing demography, increasing longevity, inequality, climate change, the increasing importance of emerging economies and the development of digital currencies. By affecting a range of phenomena � from the evolution of real interest rates to risks to the financial sector to the future of money and banking itself � all of these trends have the potential to re-shape our policy challenges. We need research to set us on the front foot to face them.     4                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches Competitions Before concluding, to catalyse interest in the One Bank Research Agenda, I am delighted to announce that today the Bank of England is launching two competitions. The first is on Data Visualisation. To coincide with the release of the new Bank data sets, we want to see what novel insights they can yield. The visualisation could be a static description of an interesting pattern or relationship in the data or the creation of an interactive app. Entrants are free to focus on whatever they like, as long as it employs some of the newly available data in some way. The second competition is for the best research paper � the �One Bank research� competition. We are particularly keen to engage early career researchers across the academic world. For our inaugural competition, the paper should be on some aspect of �The interaction between microprudential, macroprudential, and/or monetary policy�. The winners of each competition will be decided by separate judging panels of Bank staff and external academics. The prize for both competitions will be �5,000. Further details on how to apply are now live on our website.  Conclusion Economies are complex, dynamic and constantly evolving systems, underpinned by social interactions and behavioural change; shaped by fundamental forces like technology and globalisation; and supported � or at times disrupted � by finance. Policymakers need research to help understand these phenomena and to craft our responses to them. And research can make some of its most effective contributions by addressing the priorities of policymakers. By focussing on a clear set of research priorities, by opening up our datasets, and by creating tighter links between policymakers and researchers, both within the Bank and across the broader research community, we can all help advance the Bank�s mission � promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom.

2015-03-13	"Mark Carney: Writing the path back to target Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, Sheffield, 12 March 2015.                                                   *    *      *  Accompanying charts can be found at the end of the speech.  It is a great pleasure to be in the City of Steel to honour both its historic role in forging the industrial foundations of modern Britain and its current leadership in promoting advanced manufacturing for the post-industrial age. This city has been at the very forefront of innovation for hundreds of years. In the 18th Century Sheffield revolutionalised steelmaking with the discovery of the crucible steel process. By the mid-19th Century the city represented almost half of Europe�s total steel output. Since then, Sheffield has remained fleet of foot through hard work and innovation. The University of Sheffield�s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre is a prime example of that spirit. No one knows better than you that manufacturing needs to become ever-more productive to prosper in a world of steadily falling prices and relentless international competition. Prices for advanced manufactured goods fell on average by around 1 per cent a year during the decade prior to the crisis. They also have dropped steadily relative to those of simpler manufactured products � by 30 per cent over the last two decades � reflecting superior productivity growth.1 Your customers and society as a whole are the beneficiaries of your doing much more with less. The strong recovery of UK manufacturing over the past year � with growth stronger than at any point in the decade prior to the crisis � is a testament to the sector�s focus on continual improvement. Manufacturing punches well above its weight in spending on research and development. Manufactured products R&D has grown by a quarter since the mid-1980s and currently accounts for well over two-thirds of total UK spending on innovation. Advanced manufacturing sectors, including pharmaceutical, aerospace and automotive, represents well over half of this amount. Such contributions are crucial for the UK�s prosperity because our long-run economic performance hinges on productivity growth. Productivity is the ultimate determinant of people�s incomes, and with it the capacity of our economy to support health, wealth and happiness. The best contribution the Bank of England can make to these goals is to maintain monetary and financial stability. Our remit for monetary stability is simple: achieve 2% CPI inflation by setting Bank Rate, the fulcrum around which all other interest rates in the economy pivot, and, as necessary, conducting large-scale asset purchases to affect overall financial conditions. Our monetary policy framework is known as Inflation Targeting.     1     Based on ONS producer price indices. More advanced includes: printing and recording, chemicals,     pharmaceuticals, computing, electrical, machinery, motors and equipment. Less advanced includes: textiles,     products of wood, paper, rubber, basic metals, non-metals, other materials and other manufactured goods.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                               1 Over the past two decades, Inflation Targeting central banks have established good track records of keeping inflation from being too high. It has brought tangible benefits to the UK, particularly lowering the volatility of both inflation and of income growth.2 But now those central banks, including the Bank of England, are being tested by inflation that is too low. Inflation has fallen globally (Chart 1) and is below target in 16 of 18 Inflation-Targeting major economies (Chart 2). 11 of those countries have inflation rates below 1%.3 Today I will discuss the consequences for the UK of persistently low global inflation, why it matters, and what the Bank of England can do about it so that businesses and households in Sheffield and beyond can focus on what really matters to them. The bottom line is that there is a risk that the combination of persistently low global inflation and the strength of sterling could weigh on prices here for some time. But despite these headwinds, a solid UK expansion, underpinned by strong domestic demand growth, leaves us on track to return inflation to target within the next two years. To deliver that outcome, a gently rising path for Bank Rate is likely to be required over the next few years.  1.          On �lowflation� and deflation Why do we target the low, but positive, inflation rate of 2% rather than a zero or even negative rate? The simple answer is because it�s our job, given to us by the democratically elected representatives of the British people. We are accountable to Parliament for meeting it. On the occasions when inflation moves by more than 1 percentage point away from the target, we are required to explain publicly why that�s happened and what we�re doing about it in an open letter to the Chancellor. Before this year, that had happened 14 times in the past when inflation has been too high. The particularly subdued January inflation rate meant I had to write the 15th open letter, the first to address these points with respect to very low inflation. It is likely that I will have to write a few more of these over the course of the year. Our remit for 2% inflation reflects the lessons of the past, including the fight against high inflation in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the deflationary disasters that have followed past financial crises. Low, stable and predictable inflation helps to stabilise households� and firms� expectations about future price increases. That helps them plan their spending, investment and hiring decisions. In short, the Bank of England worries about inflation so that everyone else doesn�t have to. High inflation damages growth, in part, because high inflation also tends to be volatile, generating uncertainty that makes important economic decisions more difficult. In contrast, a little inflation �greases the wheels� of the economy, helping it to absorb shocks. One example of that is in the labour market, where workers usually resist reductions in their cash wages when economic conditions deteriorate. This behaviour can prevent the inflation- adjusted value of wages from declining when demand for labour is weak, leading to    2      The volatility of inflation fell by around four-fifths in the Inflation Targeting (IT) era compared to the pre-IT era.      The volatility of real GDP growth fell by around one-quarter. See also King, M (2007), �The MPC ten years      on�. 3      The UK�s CPI inflation rate of 0.3% is accompanied by PCE inflation of 0.2% in the US and HICP inflation of �      0.3% in the euro area.    2                                                                                                BIS central bankers� speeches unemployment. If that is the case, it may be better for the economy as a whole if firms� real labour costs can adjust over time through increases in prices � a little inflation � instead.4 A positive average inflation rate also gives monetary policy space to respond to negative shocks by cutting interest rates. That�s because in normal times the �equilibrium� level of interest rates at which the economy would tend to settle without generating inflation reflects, broadly, the rate of underlying growth in the economy plus the inflation target. The lower is average inflation, the less scope there would be for monetary policy to reduce interest rates in response to shocks before they approach zero. Because the equilibrium rate is so central to monetary policy I will come back to discuss it further in a few moments. Persistently low inflation can be difficult. Deflation proper � by which I mean a persistent and generalised decline in prices � is potentially dangerous. During the Great Depression, sharp falls in prices reinforced collapsing output and skyrocketing unemployment. To consider how susceptible we might be to it, it is helpful to review why such deflationary spirals are potentially dangerous. A commonly cited reason is that falling prices prompt households and firms to delay spending and investment. The subsequent reduction in demand causes further reductions in prices through higher unemployment. That further reduces incomes and spending, drawing the economy into the vortex. The relevance of that dynamic depends on households� willingness and ability to delay consumption. There are limits to the ability of households to delay consumption of some items, however, like food. And the psychology of instant gratification � the tendency for all of us to discount the future heavily relative to the present � mutes the willingness of households to wait for lower prices. It�s fair to say that thus far there�s no evidence as yet of delayed gratification taking hold in the UK.5, 6 There would be, however, a more clear and present danger arising from the balance sheets of households and firms should deflation persist. This is a concern across the advanced     4     See Tobin (1972), �Inflation and unemployment�, American Economic Review, 62. The idea is that if the     economy is hit by a shock which requires real wages to fall (like a negative productivity shock), this can     happen through either (a) keeping prices fixed (i.e. zero inflation) and cutting money wages, or (b) fixing     money wages and increasing the price level (i.e. positive inflation). The first path may involve significant     unemployment when money wages are downwardly rigid. The second, by contrast, may deliver the same     reduction in the real wages at a unemployment lower cost. See also e.g. Kim, J and F Ruge-Murcia (2009),     �How much inflation is necessary to grease the wheels?�, Journal of Monetary Economics, 56. 5     Retail sales grew by 2.3% in the three months to January, the fastest since April 2002. Consumer confidence     in the general economic situation is currently over 1 standard deviation above its historical mean and from     mid-2014 has been around its highest level since May 1998. 6     More broadly, the evidence for consumption delay is not compelling. Bachmann et al (2015) find for the US     that a one percentage point increase in expected inflation during the recent zero lower bound period reduces     households� probability of having a positive attitude towards spending by about 0.5 percentage points. Hori     and Shimizutani (2005) find some evidence of lower price expectations being correlated with consumption     delay in Japan, but the effects do not look large. Finally, consumption delay is less compelling for households     who are financially constrained and whose consumption varies more strongly with current income. Benito and     Mumtaz (2009) estimate between 20�40% of UK households display such �excess sensitivity�. See     Bachmann, R, Berg, T and Sims, E (2015), �Inflation expectations and readiness to spend: cross-sectional     evidence�, American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, 7(1); Hori, M and Shimizutani, S (2005), �Price     expectations and consumption under deflation: evidence from Japanese household survey data�, International     Economics and Economic Policy, 2; Benito, A and Mumtaz, H (2009), �Excess sensitivity, liquidity constraints,     and the collateral role of housing�, Macroeconomic Dynamics.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                    3 world, where private debt levels remain very high relative to history, including the UK (Chart 3). When a household takes out a mortgage or a firm secures a loan, the amount owed is denominated in cash terms � that is, not adjusted for inflation. Unexpected, generalised, and persistently falling prices then mean the real value of debt increases: the same amount of money is owed, but that money now buys more goods and services. As a result, more consumption or investment needs to be foregone to service the debt. This debt-deflation dynamic was at the core of the Great Depression7 and in the Japanese malaise following the collapse of the asset bubbles of the 1980s. It would be a particular concern if the pace of wage growth were to follow prices down. There is no evidence of that in the UK, where wage growth has picked up over the past six months. And more broadly, following the 2008 financial crisis debt deflation has been the dog that hasn�t barked (Chart 4).8 But we shouldn�t rest too easy � there are several reasons why the dog might have just been sleeping, and central banks need to be vigilant against the risk that recent low inflation stirs it from its slumber.  2.          Global factors and domestic inflation Low global inflation matters for the UK because we are an open economy. Around one-third of the goods and services consumed by UK households are imported, creating a direct channel from global influences to UK prices. And the UK�s exports are around 30% of GDP, opening an indirect channel through which global activity affects costs and prices in the UK through demand for our products. The importance of these channels has waxed and waned over decades, with changes to both the degree of global integration and the conduct of monetary policy. Under the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates prevailing until the early 1970s relatively closed financial and goods markets may have contributed to lower cross-country co-movements between inflation rates (Chart 5 (a) � see annex). After Bretton Woods collapsed, countries� inflation rates became more highly correlated across the advanced world as they lacked the strong nominal anchors necessary to manage global cost shocks and subsequent attempts at disinflations (Chart 5 (b) � see annex).9 That situation persisted until the early 1990s ushered in the era of Inflation Targeting (Chart 5 (c) � see annex). Central banks took greater, though not total, mastery over their monetary destinies. With increased global integration of capital, goods, and labour markets, inflation stabilisation has faced powerful countervailing forces. Perhaps as a result, advanced economy inflation rates have moved more closely together under Inflation Targeting than under Bretton Woods. The correlations between inflation rates in major economies grew in the wake of the crisis (Chart 5 (d) � see annex). As they have written their monetary scripts, central banks have at the very least had an editor. If they are not careful, they could become ghost writers.     7      First identified by Irving Fisher (1933), �The debt-deflation theory of great depressions�, Econometrica. 8      See IMF (2013), World Economic Outlook, Chapter 3, April. 9      In the UK, �the framework for monetary policy was, at best, opaque�, according to King (1997), �The Inflation      Target five years on�.    4                                                                                             BIS central bankers� speeches 3.          Why is inflation low globally? Of course, an important global factor behind current low headline inflation has been the sharp fall in the price of oil, which has been driven primarily by large increases in its actual and potential supply. This means that while it�s been a short-term drag on inflation, it�s good news for growth. The Bank estimates that lower oil prices will boost the level of UK-weighted global GDP by a little under 1 percentage point over the next three years, with a consequent boost in demand for UK exports of around 2 � %. Lower oil prices will also boost UK domestic demand directly as households spend their windfall. Our forecast conservatively assumes that they save 40 pence in every pound of that amount. On balance, there is likely upside risk to growth and inflation from this assumption. Oil isn�t the only reason why inflation is low globally. Measures of inflation that strip out volatile factors � so-called �core� inflation � have been trending down as well (Chart 6). Core inflation rates in the euro area, the US and the UK have declined by between � and 1 percentage points since 2012. Core inflation in the UK, currently around 1.4%, is likely to decline further in the coming months, reflecting sterling�s past strength and muted domestic cost growth. The weakness in core inflation across the globe reflects the shortfall of global demand below global supply (Chart 7).10 In some major economies there are additional disinflationary forces. For example, in the euro area, a series of necessary internal devaluations are weighing on wages and prices. In China, a rebalancing of investment and consumption risks generating further disinflation. The producer price inflation rate has been negative for 35 months in a row, reflecting long- standing overcapacity in industries such as concrete and steel, while the more recent weakness in the property market could further increase excess capacity in related sectors. All this suggests a persistent period of low inflation globally is a possibility, and as I mentioned a few moments ago, could itself create a self-fulfilling fear of a bad outcome. Concerns that household or government debt will weigh on demand could cause firms to delay further their already weak investment spending (Chart 8 � see annex). Such rational corporate caution is consistent with the behaviour of many financial asset prices, which appear to be pricing the possibility of material downside tail risks, such as that economic weakness and persistently low global inflation become mutually reinforcing.11 This fear of fear itself might be reflected in other asset prices too; in particular those that measure or are influenced by inflation expectations. Along with measures from household surveys, some of these have fallen in recent months.12 Those expectations matter as they feed into the wage and price setting processes that ultimately determine inflation. That is why central banks are keenly alert to the possibility that low inflation could de-anchor medium- term inflation expectations, increasing the persistence of inflation.     10      In UK-weighted terms, global output is estimated at 2% below potential. 11      Yields on sovereign bonds remain exceptionally low. In the six months to January, estimates of the equity risk      premium rose by over 100bps in the UK and the euro area back to levels last seen in the heart of the crisis �      December 2008 for the UK and June 2012 for the euro area. In addition, the probability of large declines in      equity prices implied by options prices rebounded during 2014. Discussed in Carney, M (2015), �Fortune      favours the bold�, Lecture to honour the memory of The Honourable James Michael Flaherty, P.C., Iveagh      House, Dublin. 12      Interpreting these trends is not straightforward. Household surveys may reflect consumers� assessments of      the most frequently purchased items, for example, rather than the whole CPI basket. And financial market      measures reflect not only expectations about future inflation, but also investors� required compensation for      inflation risk � the inflation risk premium � and, in the UK, the wedge between CPI and RPI inflation rates.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                    5 4.          What if inflation is slow to return to target abroad? Protracted global weakness could heighten the challenge of returning inflation quickly to target in the UK. That�s because weak global conditions would tend to push down on the equilibrium interest rate that would maintain demand in line with supply and inflation at the target. This equilibrium rate has likely been falling for the last three decades and turned sharply negative in the downturn.13 This meant central banks had to turn to unconventional policy tools to stimulate their economies in order to return inflation to target. In the cases of the UK and the US, these measures have been effective in supporting domestically generated inflation. Although the equilibrium rate might be turning positive in the UK as domestic headwinds have abated, it�s likely still to be negative in many countries, reflecting an excess of saving over investment, in particular in the euro area. In this regard, the ECB�s recent moves to reduce its main refinancing rate to 0.05%, its deposit facility rate to �0.2%, and to commence large-scale asset purchases are both timely and welcome. In an environment of low rates everywhere, even Bank Rate of �% might look high-yielding. And the fear of a bad outcome abroad could trigger safe-haven capital flows into the UK that push the value of sterling higher, making exporting more challenging, with knock-on implications for wages and prices here. That would come against the backdrop of a 5 � per cent sterling appreciation on a trade- weighted basis in the last year (Chart 9), which has extended the currency�s appreciation to around 17 per cent since its trough two years ago. These moves are reinforcing the disinflationary impulse from abroad, which could take a while to pass through to the sterling prices in the shops.14  5.          Getting back to target in the UK All of this puts a premium on generating the domestic inflation necessary to return inflation to the target. We are on track to do that. The UK economy is performing well. UK growth is solid, unemployment is coming down, and jobs have risen by 600,000 in the past year. Wage growth is showing signs of picking up, rising to 3% for the economy as a whole at the end of last year, and to 3.3% in the private sector.15 Average hours worked continue to recover on a strong upward trend. And firms� labour costs grew an estimated 1.3% in the last quarter of 2014, close to core inflation. Consumer confidence and retail sales growth are at their highest in over decade. Similarly real income growth is on course to be the strongest for more than a decade. Firms� investment intensions are robust. Surveys point to solid growth consistent with trend. There is little evidence of a deflationary mindset setting in.     13      That reflects an excess of saving over investment. That in turn reflects a combination of factors including the      protracted process of balance sheet repair in both public and private sectors, and more secular factors like      demographics (ageing and slower population growth), the higher steady state costs of financial intermediation      relative to the pre-crisis period, and, possibly, lower productivity growth, as a consequence of lasting scars      from the crisis. See Carney, M (2013), �The spirit of the season� at The Economic Club of New York; and box      on page 42 of Bank of England (2014), Inflation Report, August. 14      Protracted pass-through, generated by stickiness in the domestic price of imported goods, challenges the      classical view that the exchange rate provides an efficient shock-absorber in the face of foreign shocks. 15      These figures refer to the quarter-on-quarter annualised growth rate of the Average Weekly Earnings series.    6                                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches With domestic demand growing at around 3% in 2014, the fastest for ten years, all these factors will underpin the momentum needed to bring domestic cost growth back to up to a rate consistent with the inflation target. The fall in inflation we�ve experienced is in large part down to falling energy prices. It is not generalised �deflation� proper. The proportion of prices that are falling is consistent with the average over the past decade. The Bank will be vigilant in monitoring inflation expectations. Declining headline inflation seems likely to have cooled households� inflation expectations as the prices of the goods they buy frequently � like fuel and food � have declined markedly. On balance, however, inflation expectations remain broadly consistent with the 2% inflation target. As the MPC noted in our February Inflation Report, we retain considerable policy options in the event that downside risks materialise.  6.          Conclusion The Bank of England�s inflation target is symmetric. We care as much about inflation below target as above. With inflation below target and unemployment above its long-run sustainable rate, we are aiming to return inflation to target as quickly as possible. In our most recent forecast, The Bank expects to return inflation to target within two years and to make limited and gradual increases in Bank Rate over the next three years in order to achieve that in a sustainable manner. The pace and degree of these increases will be affected by a variety of factors, including the evolution of foreign prices and our exchange rate, as well as domestic cost pressures. While the MPC can be expected to look through one-off shocks, it may be appropriate to take into account persistent external deflationary forces arising from the combination of continued foreign low inflation and the protracted effects of sterling�s strength on the prices facing UK consumers if those forces were to intensify. Cities like Sheffield have shown that in a rapidly changing global economic landscape, hard work, clarity of purpose, and fleetness of foot grant manufacturing the freedom to write its future. The MPC also faces global risks as it seeks to return inflation to target. But we remain the author of our nominal destiny. The MPC has the responsibility to return inflation to target in a timely manner and we will seek to write the next chapter that does so.

2015-06-15	"Mark Carney: Building real markets for the good of the people Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Lord Mayor�s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London at the Mansion House, London, 10 June 2015.                                                  *    *       *  I am grateful to Ben Nelson, Iain de Weymarn, Nicola Anderson, Alex Brazier, Andrew Hauser, Chris Salmon and Tim Taylor for their assistance in preparing this speech and accompanying Open Forum document.  My Lord Mayor, Lady Mayoress, Chancellor, Ladies and Gentlemen. Almost 350 years ago, the Great Fire destroyed the City of London and rendered 100,000 people homeless. It took half a century to rebuild. The legacy of the Great Fire endures, including such Wren masterpieces as St Paul�s and his twenty-five other steeples that survive today within the City�s precincts. But the Fire�s legacy is not limited to how the City looks, it extends to what the City does. The blaze led Nicholas Barbon to establish the first insurance company, an innovation to fulfil a social need: the sharing of risk. Public authorities complemented private initiative. There was a Royal Proclamation that set standards for wider roads and houses built from brick and stone instead of timber. And Parliament passed the Parish Pump Act to prevent �mischiefs that may happen by fire� by establishing fire brigades and improving water supply. So that spark in Pudding Lane ignited much more besides the Great Fire itself: �           the provision of liquidity to limit contagion; �           a recognition that clear, well-understood codes contribute to the greater good; and �           a belief that financial markets can solve real world problems. From the coffee houses that served as meeting places for entrepreneurs and merchants; to the exchanges that supported the trading of financial claims; to a central bank that acted as lender of last resort: a rich infrastructure developed to support markets that served the UK and the world. As it grew into the world�s leading economic and trading power, the UK also became its centre of financial capitalism. By the early 20th century, though no longer the world�s largest economy, the UK was still its hub of international finance. It held close to a half of the world�s stock of overseas investments and traded one third of all negotiable instruments. The City has retained its pre-eminence through market innovation. From eurobonds to emerging market debt, credit derivatives and centralised clearing; the City has continually created new financial products and markets to serve the real economy. Today the City remains the leading global financial centre. The UK is the venue for 40% of foreign exchange trading volume, half of all trades in OTC interest rate derivatives, and more than two-thirds of trading in international bonds. More international banking activity is booked in London than anywhere else, and the UK is host to the world�s third largest insurance sector as well as its second largest asset management industry. UK markets matter for global commerce. But above all, our markets matter for our prosperity.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                             1 Markets are a major part of the UK economy. 350,000 people are employed in financial services in London alone, and 1 million across the UK as a whole. Across the country, their enterprise contributes �130 billion to our national income and �70 billion to our exports. On current trends, the UK-based non-bank financial system would increase from around six times UK GDP to nearly fifteen times by 2050. Most fundamentally, our markets serve our real economy. By financing firms to hire, invest and expand, our markets help drive UK growth. By opening up cross-border trade and investment, our markets create new opportunities for UK businesses and savers. By transferring risks to those most willing and able to bear them, our markets help UK households and businesses insure against the unexpected. Much of this activity depends on fixed income, currency and commodity markets. These FICC markets establish the borrowing costs of households, companies and governments. They set the exchange rates we use when we travel or buy goods from abroad. They determine the costs of our food and raw materials. And they help our companies manage the financial risks they incur when investing, producing and trading. Markets have become ever more important to people as they bear increasing responsibility for financing their retirements and insuring against risks. The suitability of those decisions will depend heavily on FICC markets. It is therefore vital that they work well. And are seen to do so.  The failures of FICC markets Though markets can be powerful drivers of prosperity, markets can go wrong. Left unattended, they are prone to instability, excess and abuse. Markets without the right standards or infrastructure are like cities without building codes, fire brigades or insurance. Poor infrastructure allowed the spark of the US subprime crisis to light a powder keg under UK markets, triggering the worst recession in our lifetimes. �        Poor �soft� infrastructure such as codes of conduct that too few read and too many          ignored. �        Faulty �hard� infrastructure like interest rate and foreign exchange benchmarks that          were quite literally fixed; and �        Weak banks whose light capital and heavy reliance on short-term funding created a          tinder box. Central banks shared in these failings, operating a system of fire insurance whose ambiguity was anything but constructive when global markets were engulfed in flames. The Bank of England�s general approach was consistent with the attitude of FICC markets, which historically relied heavily on informal codes and understandings. That informality was well suited to an earlier age. But as markets innovated and grew, it proved wanting. Most troubling have been the numerous incidents of misconduct that exploited such informality, undercutting public trust and threatening systemic stability. This has had direct economic consequences. Mistrust between market participants has raised borrowing costs and reduced credit availability. Falling confidence in market resilience has meant companies have held back productive investments. And uncertainty has meant     2                                                                             BIS central bankers� speeches people have hesitated to move job or home. These effects are not trivial, and they have reduced the dynamism of our economy in the post-crisis years. 1 Widespread mistrust has also had deeper, indirect costs. Markets are not ends in themselves, but powerful means for prosperity and security for all. As such they need to retain the consent of society � a social licence � to be allowed to operate, innovate and grow. Repeated episodes of misconduct have called that social licence into question. We have all been let down by these developments. And we all share responsibility for fixing them.  Real markets I believe everyone in this room would agree: we need real markets for sustainable prosperity. Not markets that collapse when there is a shock from abroad. Not markets where transactions occur in chat rooms. Not markets where no one appears accountable for anything. Real markets are professional and open, not informal and clubby. Participants in real markets compete on merit rather than collude online. Real markets are resilient, fair and effective. They maintain their social licence. Real markets don�t just happen; they depend on the quality of market infrastructure. Robust market infrastructure is a public good, one in constant danger of under-provision because the best markets innovate continually. This inherent risk can only be managed if all market actors, public and private, recognise their responsibilities for the system as a whole. The City has a special responsibility given London�s pre-eminent position in global markets, which is why it has already brought so many ideas and such energy to advance financial reform. 2  Financial reform is re-building real markets Reform is strengthening the resilience of major banks. Their capital requirements have increased ten-fold and their liquid assets are up four-fold. These banks� trading assets are down by a third and intra-bank exposures by two-thirds. Reform is ending the scourge of Too Big To Fail. The combination of eliminating the implicit public subsidy and increased capitalisation will correct the distortions caused by the structural under-pricing of risk on banks� balance sheets. And by making a further shift to market-based finance inevitable, it is increasing choice and competition � real market forces. Reform is also improving risk transfer by untangling the complex web of derivatives that meant failures like Lehman triggered chaos; and by creating simple, transparent and comparable securitisation markets. This reform agenda has increased the effectiveness of FICC markets and reinforced their social licence.    1     See Haddow, A, Hare, C, Hooley, J and Shakir, T (2013) �Macroeconomic uncertainty: what is it, how can we     measure it and why does it matter?�, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Q2. See also Bloom, N, et al (2014),     �Really uncertain business cycles�, mimeo. 2     Examples include the contribution of the private sector to: the development of revised ISDA protocols as part     of efforts to tackle Too Big To Fail; improvements in disclosure under the aegis of the Enhanced Disclosure     Taskforce; consultation over TLAC proposals; the establishment of the Banking Standards Council; and on-     going work to develop the appropriate near-risk free reference rate for sterling markets.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                  3 It is frustrating for us all that such major progress risks being overshadowed by misconduct problems.  The fair and effective markets review We must break the back of these issues, and the Fair and Effective Markets Review shows the way forward. With its publication today, all the main building blocks are now in place for the real markets we need. I want to pay tribute to my colleagues Charles Roxburgh, Minouche Shafik and Martin Wheatley, who so ably led the Review. And to salute Elizabeth Corley, who so expertly chaired the Review�s independent Market Practitioner panel, canvassing and coalescing views from across the industry. The importance and complexity of their task is illustrated by the multiple root causes of the misconduct in FICC markets. Specifically, the Review identifies: �        Market structures which presented specific opportunities for abuse, such as poor          benchmark design, and which more generally were vulnerable to conflicts of          interest, collusion, and thin markets; �        Standards of acceptable market practice that were usually poorly understood, often          ignored and always lacked teeth; �        Firms� systems of internal governance and control that were incapable of asserting          the interests of firms � let alone the wider market � over those of close-knit trading          staff; �        Individual incentives that were skewed, with pay packages stressing short-term          returns overlong-term value and good conduct; �        And personal accountability that was lacking, with a culture of impunity developing in          parts of the market. All these factors contributed to an ethical drift. Unethical behaviour went unchecked, proliferated and eventually became the norm. Too many participants neither felt responsible for the system nor recognised the full impact of their actions. For too many, the City stopped at its gates, though its influence extended far beyond. A good start has been made in addressing these deficiencies. The design and regulation of key FICC benchmarks has been overhauled and transparency in FICC markets is being enhanced. Compensation rules have, in the main, been transformed to align better risk and reward. From next year, senior managers of banks and insurers will be held directly accountable for failures in their areas of responsibility. And the best firms are improving the �tone from the top�, launching conduct training and revamping control structures. But major gaps remain. These are evidenced by enforcement actions which continue to appear with depressing frequency. These sanctions, while necessary, aren�t the solution, not least since the $150 billion of fines levied on global banks translates into more than $3 trillion of reduced lending capacity to the real economy. We need a better balance between individual and firm accountability. But who should be accountable? Against which standards? And with what consequences? In these regards, I welcome the Review�s recommendations that:     4                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches First, individuals must be held to account. Doing so requires new, common standards, cast in clear language; better training and qualifications for FICC personnel; and mechanisms to ensure that when individuals are fired, their history will be known to those who consider hiring them. Second, firms must take greater responsibility for the system by improving the quality, clarity and market-wide understanding of FICC trading practices. I welcome the industry�s leadership in drawing up plans for a new FICC Market Standards Board. The Board�s mandate will be to establish readily understandable standards, keep them up-to-date with market developments, and promote adherence to them. Crucially, the Board will be dynamic, and will monitor and address areas of uncertainty in specific trading practices. This is a major opportunity for the industry to establish common standards of market practice that are well understood, widely followed and, crucially, that keep pace with markets. If firms and their staff fail to take this opportunity, more restrictive regulation is inevitable. To give these measures teeth, key elements of the Senior Managers Regime should be extended to all firms active in wholesale FICC markets, including dealers and asset managers. That means all senior managers would have clearly defined responsibilities and would be answerable for training, certifying and monitoring the material risk takers they supervise. The FCA should oversee compliance, redeploying resources to focus on Senior Persons. In turn, these individuals would be on the hook for promoting compliance within their organisations. Incentives will be aligned. For the best in the industry, this won�t be new. This is just how you run your business. But for others, who free ride on your reputations: the Age of Irresponsibility is over. Third, regulators should extend the coverage of market abuse regulation to include every major fixed income and currency market. And criminal sanctions should be updated, with market abuse rules similarly extended and maximum prison terms lengthened. Finally we need global standards for global markets. I welcome the FICC Markets Standards Board�s intent to be as global as possible in its membership and influence. All major Central Banks and market participants have begun working on developing a new single Global Code for FX. I would encourage IOSCO to consider complementing these efforts with a similar initiative to cover FICC markets as a whole when they meet in London next week. The FSB will engage with these processes and work to improve the alignment between remuneration and conduct risk across the globe.  The Bank of England�s role All must play a role in building real markets, including the Bank of England. Although the Bank does not regulate conduct or markets per se, it has responsibilities for, and powers over, the stability of the UK�s financial system as a whole. In the run-up to the crisis, the Bank�s contribution to the effectiveness of markets fell short in three respects. In all cases, the Bank is now responding. First, the Bank�s framework for providing liquidity was shown to have lagged behind market developments. Once under pressure, the Bank could neither stabilise overnight rates nor support the banking system. Fortunately, in the jaws of the crisis, the Bank innovated rapidly and admirably to avoid a collapse of the system. Those lessons are now embedded in a new, comprehensive framework for the Bank�s sterling market operations. We have expanded the range of eligible collateral, and will lend to many more counterparties, at much longer maturities. The Bank also stands ready to act as a market maker of last resort. Constructive Ambiguity has been replaced by Open for Business.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                   5 Second, like many others, the Bank neither identified the scale of risks in the system nor spotted the gaps in the regulatory architecture. Following the Chancellor�s reforms in the last Parliament, the Bank now has statutory responsibility to protect and enhance the stability of the UK�s financial system, and is working as One Bank to do so. The FPC and the PRA have catalysed a series of actions that influence market resilience including stress tests of banks and hedge funds, system-wide capital actions, and new tools like the leverage ratio and minimum repo haircuts. 3 Third, the Bank�s arcane governance blurred the Bank�s accountability and, by extension, weakened the social licence of markets. Before my arrival, the Bank�s governance was reshaped. The Bank�s board of directors, Court, has been strengthened. Its external members now have formal powers to observe the meetings of the Bank�s policy committees and to commission reviews into the Bank�s performance. 4 I welcome the Government�s intention to introduce legislation further strengthening the governance and accountability of the Bank. The Bank will continue to modernise its operations. Following the Grabiner report, the Bank has focused its Market Intelligence programme, strengthened procedures, improved training and overhauled compliance. And the Bank is introducing today a new code of conduct. The Bank expects its senior management to meet the highest standards of professional conduct. As one example, the Bank will apply the core principles of the Senior Managers Regimes to its own senior staff, including the Governor. This is in addition to existing obligations and scrutiny from Court, Parliament, the media and the general public. And the Bank will continue to reinforce its commitment to openness and transparency. Minutes of Court meetings are now published with minimal delay. The Monetary Policy Committee will publish transcripts of its deliberations with an appropriate lag. Whenever there are difficult issues, outside reviews of the Bank�s performance will be conducted, publicly released and acted upon.  Looking ahead The Bank welcomes such scrutiny of our activities, including open debate about the cumulative impact of reform on the functioning of markets. In particular, while the core of the system has been made more resilient, the combination of new prudential requirements on dealers and structural changes in markets has reduced market depth and increased potential volatility. This process likely has further to run, particularly as the normalisation of global monetary conditions edges closer. Firms and regulators should be alert to these developments, including their consequences for investment funds that offer daily liquidity while investing in securities that only appear liquid. To be clear, more expensive liquidity is a price well worth paying for making the core of the system more robust. Removing public subsidies is absolutely necessary for real markets to exist. Volatility characterises such real markets and much of the pre-crisis market making capacity among dealers was ephemeral. However, the possibility of sharp, unpredictable changes in market liquidity poses a clear risk to financial stability, particularly when some    3     See, inter alia, the Record of the FPC meeting held on 20th November 2013, which summarises the outcome     of joint work with the FCA on �snap-back� risk; Bank of England (2014), �Stress testing the UK banking     system: 2014 results�, December; Bank of England (2014), �The Financial Policy Committee�s review of the     leverage ratio�, October. 4     Including from a new independent evaluation office that reports directly to the non-executive Chairman.    6                                                                                         BIS central bankers� speeches market participants take liquidity for granted and crowd into trades in anticipation of central bank action. The Bank is keenly alert to such risks. The FPC and the FSB are currently analysing these issues and welcome perspectives on whether the market, regulation or both should adjust for the good of the system.  Conclusion With the main building blocks of reform in place, now is the time to take stock. It�s vital that we � public authorities and private market participants � work together to reverse the tide of ethical drift. This cannot be a one-off exercise. We need continuous engagement so that market infrastructure keeps pace with market innovation. That�s why the Bank is announcing that it will hold an Open Forum this Autumn which will bring together all stakeholders in FICC markets. Our goal is to discuss the prospects for market functioning, where regulations might overlap or conflict, and whether enough has been done to build the real markets the UK deserves. To prompt an open discussion, we are publishing a detailed paper which reviews these issues and draws out such questions. 5 Everyone has an interest in the future of financial markets, so I would strongly encourage you to engage with our Open Forum process online and at the conference itself. An Open and Accountable Bank welcomes your input. Our response to recent failings should be as ambitious as those of our predecessors to the Great Fire: renewed prosperity built on private markets and public market infrastructure. Let our legacy be the earthly equivalent of Wren�s ethereal genius, real markets so that the City can do what it does best: transact and innovate for the good of the people of the United Kingdom and the world.

2015-07-20	"Mark Carney: From Lincoln to Lothbury � Magna Carta and the Bank of England Lecture by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, as part of the Lincoln Lectures 2015, Lincoln, 16 July 2015.                                                    *     *     *  I am particularly grateful to Professor Nicholas Vincent for commenting on an earlier draft of this speech, and to James Bell, Ben Nelson and Iain de Weymarn for assistance in its preparation.   A burst of inflation. A crisis in the public finances. Public sector bailouts. Infighting in Europe. Not eight years ago, but eight hundred. That was the economic context for the striking of Magna Carta. To many today, Magna Carta is a document of profound, almost mythical, significance. It is seen as the cornerstone of the United Kingdom�s constitutional arrangements and as a blueprint for the constitutions of many other nations, including the United States. It is credited with establishing the foundations of parliamentary democracy, creating a framework for the rule of law, protecting individual liberty, defending the rights of the innocent, and limiting the role of the State. It is undoubtedly true that Magna Carta � or more correctly the idea of Magna Carta � has played a central role in British political development over the centuries, not least as a banner under which those seeking liberty from oppression have rallied. But many modern scholars argue that its significance, in and of itself, has been overstated. They characterise Magna Carta as a pragmatic political document that was a product of its time, including the difficult economic circumstances that then prevailed. As usual with historical arguments, the answer lies somewhere in between. In what follows, I will spend a few moments on the pragmatic element not only because it plays to my comparative advantage as an economist but also because it ultimately underscores the foundational character of the document itself. The enduring legacy of Magna Carta is how its strictures on unconstrained power are reflected in our systems of political and economic governance. I will conclude that both the constitutional and pragmatic perspectives are relevant to modern central banking and the current conduct of monetary policy. Specifically, the costs of inflation were among the key economic catalysts of Magna Carta, and its core constitutional legacy � namely the importance of delegated authority, with clear lines of public accountability � is at the heart of the Bank of England�s institutional arrangements. In the spirit of Magna Carta, the Bank of England has been given a great responsibility: to deliver monetary stability for the good of the people of the United Kingdom. Our goal, the 2 per cent inflation target, is set by the Government, and we operate under constrained discretion in its pursuit.  1.          The economic and political context Where did Magna Carta come from?     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                   1 The political background is one of nearly constant conflict both within the dysfunctional �English� monarchical family, as well as with France over control of Normandy and the rest of Henry II�s continental empire. 1 The England of the 1200s was far from a unitary state. Most matters were administered by local barons, with the King acting as an arbiter in the event of a dispute. The relationship between local (baronial) and central (monarchical) authority was much less deferential, and much more arms-length, than it is today. Indeed, the early Plantagenet Kings of England spent most of their time living at home in Normandy or Anjou, allowing the English barons a considerable degree of autonomy. It was only after King John lost Normandy to the French in 1204 that the King resided full-time in England, breathing down the necks of the barons, who did not much like the closer observation of their activities, and the eyeing of their stockpiles of silver that this proximity entailed. The relationship between the barons and King John broke down in part because of unsustainable public finances, with John imposing an intolerably heavy and arbitrary tax burden in order to pay for royal extravagance, infighting, and wars with the French. The royal judicial system, whose tendrils extended ever deeper into the barons� lives, was used to extort cash and as an instrument of royal control, rather than to ensure �justice�. What lay behind such unsustainable public finances? First, and most obviously, the need to pay for constant military protection for the Normandy estates created what modern-day macroeconomists would think of as an enormous structural deficit. If John had let his expulsion from the continent be the end of the matter this financial burden would have extinguished itself. But he did not. His folly was a series of vain attempts to re-conquer Normandy, efforts which finally ended on the eve of Magna Carta. 2 Second, the monarchic finances had taken a colossal hit in 1193 because of the need to fund a gigantic public sector bailout. Richard I had managed to get himself caught in Germany on his way back from the Holy Land and was held to ransom for �66,000 in silver. Being �Too Big To Jail�, the equivalent of two to three times annual crown income was needed to bail him out. In comparison, the government�s peak cash support to UK banks in 2007�2010 amounted to a trifling one-quarter of annual UK government revenues. 3 Third, the need to raise additional cash for the public finances was made much more problematic by the strain of inflation, which accelerated in the early years of the 13th century. 4 The problem was that a large proportion of regular crown income came in the form of �farms�, which were fixed rental payments for leases to use the King�s land for agriculture. These farms were fixed by custom in nominal terms, whereas the King�s expenditures were not. The King�s finances were unhedged.     1     For an excellent summary, see Vincent, N (2012), Magna Carta: a very short introduction, Oxford University     Press. 2     His allies were finally defeated in 1214 at the Battle of Bouvines, which ended the 1202�1214 Anglo-French     War. 3     This would have been bad enough on its own. What was even worse was that it had come only five years after     the collection of the �Saladin Tithe�, a windfall tax of a similar amount, in order to pay for a campaign to     wrestle Jerusalem out of the hands of Salahuddin Ayubi, who had captured it in 1187. That cost the barons     one-tenth of all their revenues and movable property. 4     Latimer (2001) suggests that the inflation was concentrated in the first six years or so of the thirteenth century.     See Latimer, P (2001), �The English inflation of 1180�1220 reconsidered�, Past and Present, No. 171,     pages 3�29.    2                                                                                             BIS central bankers� speeches In fairness to the monarchy, there was not an enormous amount that could be done about this. There was obviously no CPI(H) to which the leasehold rents could be indexed. The UK�s statistical challenges have a long history. The preferred way of hedging the risk was to kick the leaseholders off the land, and bring it into direct demesne management. 5 This is what the barons themselves had been doing with their own land holdings. By taking it into demesne control, instead of receiving a fixed nominal rent, the lord of the manor could take receipt of the real output of the land, which could be consumed, traded, or sold for silver at the going spot price. The consequence was that the richer the baron, the more land he had to exploit, and the greater his potential profits. The effect was to create a massively wealthy elite of oligarchs, now breaking free both of the middling ranks of the gentry at one end, and of the hard-pressed King (or public sector) at the other. In all of this, the option of demesne management was infeasible for the King, likely because it would have involved destabilising relations with the administrative class of �sheriffs� and other royal officials upon whom the King�s political stability depended. 6  Causes of the inflation Forget royal infighting, wars or the whiff of revolution, it is inflation that really sets the pulses of central bankers racing. And for good reason because closer inspection suggests that inflation may have been a significant catalyst to Magna Carta. Historians estimate that prices were rising sharply in the early 1200s. The prices of agricultural goods, including wheat and oxen, probably doubled in that period. 7 Evidence suggests that prices of linen, wax, lead and even palfreys � the Toyota Prius of medieval horses � were also rising rapidly. Wages were rising as well � and to a greater extent than could have just been the consequence of medieval real-wage resistance. King John was paying his knights almost three times as much as Henry II (even though they weren�t as productive on the battlefield). 8 The daily rate for foot-soldiers had doubled. And limited evidence suggests the wages of skilled labourers on the crown estates probably increased by a similar proportion. 9 With pay growth approaching 20% a year, wages really were fizzing! 10 The underlying causes of this inflation are debated among historians, but the most convincing argument is that the inflation was a monetary one, albeit with a twist. Not     5      Harvey, P. D. A., (1973), �The English inflation of 1180�1220�, Past and Present, No. 61, pages 3�30. 6      Given the countless other abuses of authority that were going on at the time, one wonders why it was so      problematic for the rents simply to be �renegotiated� periodically. In part, custom dictated that this was not the      done thing. In part, the problem lay with the �sheriffs� in each of England�s counties. They were responsible for      collecting the fixed farms from the King's assets. In normal years, they made an enormous profit, paying only      a small fixed farm to the King, yet raking in a great deal more in terms of the real income of the counties. They      were accustomed to keeping this surplus. Any attempt to reform this system, by reducing the imbalance      between real income and fixed farm threatened to destabilise relations between the King and the vitally      significant administrative class of sheriffs and other royal officials upon whom the King�s political stability      depended. As a result, the Kings� preference was to find other ways of raising the cash. 7      Latimer (ibid.). As Latimer says, �[b]etween 1198 and 1206, sheep prices, wine prices and the price paid by      the exchequer for its regular supply of cloth all indicate a steep and sustained increase.� 8      Harvey (ibid.). Henry II had paid his knights 8d per day: King John was handing over 2s or 3s, an increase of      about 275%. 9      Less directly, one can infer from evidence on the exercise by manorial lords of their options to take cash      payments from their villeins (peasants), instead of forcing them to work the land, that the going rate for      unskilled farm labour must also have increased. 10      Assuming those increases occurred over the six years Latimer identifies as the period of significant inflation.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                          3 surprisingly, the quantitative information on the thirteenth century money supply is of very poor quality, imputed, as it has been, from archaeological finds of cash hoards. 11 Latimer notes that ��between the middle of the twelfth century and the middle of the thirteenth century there was an enormous increase in the quantity of silver coins in England.� As well as the possibility of a general increase in the European silver supply (especially with the opening up of the Harz silver mines in eastern Germany), it is likely that silver inflows to England in particular were boosted as the counterpart to a sizeable private trade surplus � probably resulting, especially, from the success of the wool trade with Flanders. Over several decades, these silver inflows were likely to have much more than offset the �public sector deficit� as silver leaked out to pay for the protection of Normandy as well as the occasional trip to the Holy Land. As a result, the balance of payments was probably in surplus for years, with the consequent increase in the silver money supply going unsterilised. Even to a thirteenth century Englishman, global monetary conditions mattered. Would Britain�s constitutional history have been different had King John lamented: A Central Bank! A Central Bank! My Kingdom for a Central Bank!? He needed one because other factors reinforced monetary developments, including the usual suspect � financial innovation. Specifically, developments in the common law made land an increasingly liquid asset, and therefore one capable for the first time of being used as a store of wealth. 12 This set a medieval financial accelerator in train (about 750 years before Ben Bernanke coined the term) 13 by providing an alternative to storing one�s wealth in silver coin (prone to being whisked away by the King). This led to a reduction in the demand for silver money balances. An increase in money velocity would have followed and with it, all else being equal, price inflation until the transactions demand for silver had risen sufficiently to equal its supply. At the very least, the existence of an alternative store of wealth provided an environment in which money velocity could take off, were it to be nudged in that direction. One possible nudge was the anticipation of the re-coinage of 1204. 14 Re-coinages were good for the King because he benefitted from the seigniorage of the re-minting fee. They were bad for cash holders both because of the re-minting fee and because they had to exchange their clipped coins for what they were actually worth, rather than their face value (a medieval haircut � some of which were appalling). Consequently, there was a strong incentive not to be the one holding the old-issue coins when the music stopped. 15 So to sum up: a fiscal squeeze exacerbated by accelerating inflation, combined with monarchical ambition and incompetence to stretch and then break relations with the barons.     11      In very crude terms, the supposition here has been that we can extrapolate from the quantity of coins found in      modern times the number of moneyers and mints that were in operation in the thirteenth century. With this      information, we can then work out how many coins each moneyer struck (the only coin in circulation at this      time being the silver penny), and then calculate the total money supply. 12      Palmer, R. C. (1985), �The Economic and Cultural Impact of the Origins of Property: 1180�1220�, Law and      History Review, 3 No. 2, Autumn, pages 375�396. 13      Bernanke, B, Gertler, M and Gilchrist, S (1996), �The financial accelerator and the flight to quality�, The      Review of Economics and Statistics, Vol. LXXVIII, 1, February. 14      Latimer (ibid.). 15      It is perhaps for this reason � a thirteenth century manifestation of Gresham�s Law � that archaeological finds      of coin hoards are often thought to contain suspiciously high proportions of freshly minted coins.    4                                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches 2.          Constitutional significance In that context, Magna Carta was a desperate (and probably disingenuous) attempt at a peace treaty that failed almost immediately. Brokered by the Church, and issued by King John in June 1215, the Charter sought to placate the disgruntled barons. It is doubtful that John ever intended to uphold his side of the bargain, with all the constraints on his authority that this implied. Indeed, within a few months of its agreement, by the end of August 1215, John had convinced Pope Innocent III to annul the Charter on the grounds that it had been issued under duress. 16 The 1215 Magna Carta was never enacted, and England slipped into the First Barons� War. Charters of this type were not uncommon at that time. It had been fairly routine, in fact, for English kings to attempt to curry favour with the nobles upon whom the stability of their realm depended by rubbishing the reputations of their predecessors and issuing �coronation charters� that demonstrated how virtuous and peace-loving they were by comparison. It was also fairly routine for kings to renege on the promises in those charters, creating fertile ground to begin the cycle anew. 17 What was novel about Magna Carta was that: (a) it was longer and more detailed than its predecessors; and (b) it was issued not at John�s coronation, but under compulsion from a true political opposition, sixteen years into his reign and evidentially too late to serve its purpose. 18 This brings a second observation. Obnoxious and tyrannical as he might have been, King John was not solely to blame for the aristocratic discontent that led to Magna Carta. His predecessors had reneged on their promises, mismanaged the realm and imperilled its finances. John�s administrative and military incompetence were merely the straws that broke the camel�s back. If Magna Carta was such a product of its time, how did it become to be so venerated? And once we cut through the legend, what is its significance for economic governance today? The revisionist interpretation of Magna Carta as a timeless statement of natural rights and liberties became imprinted onto the minds of the English-speaking world only in the 17th century. In large part, this was due to the work of Edward Coke. As well as being an enormously influential jurist, Coke was also the author of popular English legal textbooks that exported his views around the world. Coke resurrected the long-forgotten Magna Carta from 400 years of obscurity by appealing to its spirit in order to resist the absolutist tendencies of the Stuart Kings James I and his son Charles I � themselves inspired by the continental European model of monarchic divine-right. The Charter, Coke argued, could trace its lineage from an ancient constitution that harked back not just to the time of pre-Norman King Edward the Confessor, but to King Arthur himself (!): an ancient constitution that was now being imperilled � and with it the Englishman�s rightful way of life � by the tyrannical behaviour of the Stuarts.     16      John had restored himself to favour from excommunication and placed himself under the protection of      Innocent by pronouncing himself a papal vassal, and England a papal fief, in 1213 and subsequently by      �taking the cross� in March 1215 � i.e., declaring himself a crusader. 17      The coronation charter of Henry I issued in 1100 (which was also endorsed by Henry II at his own coronation      in 1154) is a pertinent example because it was effectively the draft on which Magna Carta was later based,      containing several of the clauses now regarded as the most significant. The original text was written in one      continuous flow. Its division into clauses is a modern construct. 18      Moreover it came after a lacuna of sixty years during which the House of Plantagenet had issued no similar      conciliatory charters and whose actions in the meantime had caused sufficient damage to the relationship      between nobility and monarchy as to make an uprising inevitable.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                  5 Despite the efforts of Coke and others, Charles I�s rejection of all enterprise to constrain his authority led to the English Civil War and to the king�s beheading in 1649. Meanwhile, Coke�s unstoppable Magna Carta redux had been set in motion. In contradiction to their behaviour at home, James and Charles had been busily granting royal charters promising the liberties of Englishmen to the American colonists. Coke himself had been involved in the drafting of the first charter of the Virginia Company in 1606, and similar English liberties were extended in the charters of Massachusetts, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Carolina over the next sixty years. Some have argued that references to Magna Carta, however irrelevant its provisions might by then have been, were used as a way of �drumming up� New World settlers. To this day, 25 US States have extracts from Magna Carta on their statute books; a further 17 have the full text. Goodness knows how the latter intend to enforce the removal of �[a]ll fish-weirs � from the Thames, the Medway, and throughout the whole of England, except on the sea coast� (Clause 33). Of course, sometimes American extraterritoriality literally knows no bounds. Coke�s romantic resurrection of Magna Carta transformed it into part of the backdrop to the American Revolution, with his influence clearly evident in the drafting of the US Constitution.                                                 *   *   *  We have seen how the economic forces and political developments of the time played a crucial part in the mounting hostilities between King John and the barons that led to Magna Carta and First Barons� War. Given that background, it is not as shocking as it first seems that Magna Carta is very largely taken up with the parochial interests of the rich. It is dominated by three basic themes: taxes; abuses of the �judicial system� with the aim of raising revenue; and the protection of the barons� mercantile interests. Given how irrelevant those specific concerns now seem, it is hardly surprising that almost all of the Charter�s clauses that survived the 1225 re-issue (and therefore made it into the law in the first place) have since been repealed. In fact, only four clauses of the original 66 remain. These stand out as different in character from the others. They are much more general, universal and timeless. They are: �        Clause 1: Freedom for the Church. �        Clause 13: Protection for the �ancient liberties� of the City of London. �        Clause 39: No wrongful imprisonment. Perhaps the most famous clause. �No free          man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or          outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any way, nor will we proceed with          force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his          equals or by the law of the land.� �        Clause 40: Justice is not for sale. Added to that, the spirit of Clause 12 of the 1215 Magna Carta (dropped from all later reissues), that �no �scutage� or �aid� may be levied in our kingdom without its general consent��, is clearly what would later become �no taxation without representation�: to establish a council (the embryonic embodiment of what would later become Parliament) to agree whatever new taxes the King might demand. Whatever their purpose at the time, the more universal clauses that remain on the statute book certainly resonate today. They in effect encompass the idea of the rule of law and of due process as a means to ensure justice. It is tempting, therefore, to think of these clauses as being the enduring legacy of Magna Carta, while at the same time allowing ourselves to patronise the juxtaposition of these apparently fundamental principles alongside so much    6                                                                            BIS central bankers� speeches antiquated gibberish about fish-weirs, the obligation to construct bridges, and the theft of wood for building castles. This would, I think, be a mistake. The specificity of the clauses animates the general principles. It is because they are detailed and targeted at the concerns of the time that they are a genuine attempt to place a boundary on the authority of the King, rather than relying on vague platitudes. 19 Magna Carta was nowhere near the first attempt to encapsulate ideas of justice and good government, nor was it the last. Indeed, it was a spectacularly unsuccessful attempt � and it was anyway concerned only with the interests of a very small segment of society. But, largely because King John�s heirs were forced into a tight corner and therefore obliged to reissue the charter again and again after 1215 (in 1216, 1217, 1225, 1234, 1253, 1265, 1297 and 1300, to cite only the more famous reissues), it is Magna Carta that has become the icon of the principle that the exercise of authority requires permission from those subject to that authority � and that, once granted, this permission can just as easily be withdrawn. At its most idealised, Magna Carta makes clear that power derives from the people and constrains the authority of the state. The state can in turn devolve power � to regions � and to independent bodies. But these bodies can never forget from where their power came or to whom they are responsible. Their authority is constrained to that necessary to pursue specific objectives and they are accountable to the people for their performance.  3.          Monetary policy outlook The Bank�s current Monetary Policy framework embodies these principles. It wasn�t always the case. The Bank of England was brought into public ownership in 1946. As former Governor Eddie George remarked, for the half century that followed �the Bank operated under legislation which, remarkably, did not attempt to define our objectives or functions.� They were, instead, �assumed to carry over from [the Bank�s] earlier long history.� 20 In that regard, the Bank�s �constitution� resembled that of the United Kingdom more broadly, comprising a rich history of law, principle and convention. All changed with the passing of the Bank of England Act in 1998, which made specific �provision about the constitution, regulation, financial arrangements and functions of the Bank.� The Act brought great clarity to the Bank�s responsibilities and granted independence to the Bank for the operation of monetary policy. In delegating authority to an independent body in this way, the Act ensured the Bank would operate under what Mervyn King described as �constrained� rather than �unfettered� discretion. The Bank would be accountable to Parliament for operating the instruments of monetary policy to achieve the objectives of monetary policy, which would be determined by the Government. 21 The operational independence of the Bank of England is an example of power flowing from the people via Parliament within carefully circumscribed limits. Independence in turn demands accountability in order that the Bank commands the legitimacy it needs to fulfil its mission. By publishing its analysis, giving testimony, and delivering speeches, the Bank explains how it is exercising its powers to achieve its clearly defined policy Remits.     19      Even the �fish weirs� clause (33) can be read, in hindsight, as a protection both of the public good (in Roman      law terms, res publica) and of the freedom of navigation: the same principle for the which the English entered      into the Seven Years War of 1756�63, whose costs, in turn, brought about the American Revolution of 1776. 20      George, E. (2000), �Central bank independence�, speech at the SEANZA Governors� Symposium, 26 August      2000. 21      See, for example, King, M. (2000), �Monetary policy: theory in practice�, 7th January 2000. King attributes the      �constrained� versus �unfettered� distinction originally to Ben Bernanke and Frederick Mishkin.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                          7 To illustrate these points, I will conclude with some reflections on monetary policy. Our objective, given to us by Parliament, is to maintain price stability and, subject to that, to support the economic policy of Her Majesty�s Government, including its objectives for growth and employment. Our Remit builds in important accountability and transparency mechanisms. One of which is the requirement for the Governor to write an open letter to the Chancellor if inflation moves away from its 2 per cent target by more than one percentage point.  Inflation developments I am in the middle of a likely sequence of such open letters � I have another one due next month � on account of the record low inflation the UK is experiencing this year, currently at zero per cent. Such letters must explain, among other things, why inflation has deviated from target and what policy actions the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is taking in response. The �why� is straightforward. The bulk of the shortfall of inflation below target can be explained by the sharp fall in the prices of commodities and other imported goods since last year. Of these, the single most important factor has been the steep drop in energy prices globally. The rise in the value of sterling has also played an important role in lowering non-energy import prices, which have fallen over the past twelve months. The sum total of these effects has been to drag inflation below target by around 1� percentage points. This temporary period of below-target inflation has provided a welcome boost to real household income.  Inflation looking ahead The MPC�s intention is to return inflation to target in a sustainable manner within two years. That means setting Bank Rate to eliminate the remaining slack in the economy, bringing about the sustained increase in costs necessary to achieve overall inflation of 2%. I expect that this will involve raising Bank Rate over the next three years from its current all- time low of � per cent. The need for Bank Rate to rise reflects the momentum in the economy and a gradual firming of underlying inflationary pressures � a firming that will become more apparent as the effects of past commodity price falls drop out of the annual inflation rate around the end of the year. It also reflects the lags in monetary policy, given that the peak impact on inflation of a given adjustment in interest rates is likely to materialise around 18�24 months after the change. As the economy evolves, different factors will become worthy of particular attention in informing the timing, pace and degree of likely Bank Rate increases. At the current juncture, three stand out. First are the prospects that sustained momentum in economic activity will wring out any remaining slack. This will require sustained growth above its past average of around 0.6 per cent per quarter. 22 Even though the current recovery has been the slowest since the Great Depression, taking around 1� years longer to regain lost ground than it did following the recession of the 1930s, the signs are encouraging. Looking through the blip in the first quarter, the economy has now been growing above trend for a year and unemployment has fallen sharply over the past two. Consumer confidence is around its highest level for over a decade. Businesses investment intentions are solid. Momentum in the housing market is showing signs of returning. 23 Survey data point to continued momentum in real activity over the remainder of this year.    22      Based on average quarterly GDP growth since 1993. 23      The impact of Buy to Let changes will be examined in August Inflation Report.    8                                                                                    BIS central bankers� speeches To be sure, the international risks to the growth outlook remain. The situation in Greece is fluid, and the on-going slowdown in China could prove more significant. But on balance we can expect the global economy to proceed at a solid, not spectacular, pace. 24 Second, domestic costs need to continue to firm. After a period of particularly weak wage growth, which reflected a marked expansion in labour supply that is now largely absorbed, wage growth is picking up. 25 The recent growth in wages has been stronger than we had expected in May, though most of the upside news was in bonuses, which are a less reliable guide to firms� future labour costs. 26 At a minimum, when taken together with survey indicators that continue to point to solid pay growth for new recruits, recent data give welcome reassurance that the risks associated with a deflationary mindset in the labour market have likely fallen significantly. Further positive wage developments should be supported by a continued tightening in the labour market. Job-to-job flows remain around post-crisis highs and the ratio of vacancies to unemployment "
2015-09-02	"Mark Carney: Inflation in a globalised world Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, 29 August 2015.                                                     *    *     *  Accompanying charts can be found at the end of the speech or on the Bank of England�s website.  I am grateful to Ambrogio Cesa-Bianchi, Bob Gilhooly, Gene Kindberg-Hanlon, Ben Nelson, Ivan Petrella, Greg Thwaites, and Iain de Weymarn for help in preparing these remarks.   I.          Introduction In this era of hyperglobalisation, 1 are central banks still masters of their domestic monetary destinies? Or have they become slaves to global factors? To what extent does a global financial cycle dominate domestic transmission mechanisms and does that, as some might suggest, confer particular responsibilities on those central banks that most influence it? On the surface, there�s evidence of global inflationary cycles that correspond with an intensifying globalisation that propagates common shocks via commodity, trade and financial channels. Correlations of CPI are as elevated today as during the first oil shock and on the surface we appear to be in the midst of a highly synchronised global rates cycle. But as is often the case, appearances deceive. Correlations of headline CPI largely reflect price level shocks such as those to oil (Chart 1). Core inflation rates exhibit much less co- movement but rather vary with increasingly divergent underlying economic conditions (Chart 2). The stance of monetary policy reflects these differences. After adjusting for unconventional policy there�s greater monetary policy divergence than implied by a simple eyeballing of the currently highly synchronised global rates cycle. And there remains the prospect of a further widening. In other words, domestic economic conditions � conditions affected by domestic monetary policy � still very much matter. None of this diminishes the considerable challenges of returning inflation to target in the face of global developments. There are profound secular and cyclical disinflationary forces at work in the global economy, and for economies like the UK their impact is being reinforced by exchange rate movements which will drag inflation down further at the policy horizon. Moreover, as events of the past few weeks have reminded us, a variety of global factors can affect global financial conditions and influence the neutral rate of interest. Central banks must take these Disparate Confounding Dynamics (DCDs) into account when setting policy. 2 Even for those economies with the strongest recoveries and the best functioning financial systems, they mean that the policy rates consistent with returning inflation to target will likely need to rise in a gradual fashion and to a limited extent despite robust domestic demand and firming domestic costs. For the UK at least, global DCDs influence but do not dictate policy.     1      Subramanian, A and Kessler, M (2013), �The hyperglobalization of trade and its future�, Global Citizen      Foundation working paper 3, June. 2      Faust, J and Leeper, E (2015), �The myth of normal: the bumpy story of inflation and monetary policy�, mimeo      at this Symposium.

Developments in global inflation The different balance of domestic and global forces across economies can be seen in the dispersion in underlying inflation outcomes since the Great Moderation. The Bretton Woods system collapsed with the onset of the Great Inflation. Cross-country inflation correlations rose sharply from close to zero for much of the 1960s to about � in the early 1970s as fiscal shocks were reinforced by the global oil price shock in the absence of nominal anchors. The eventual discovery of these anchors culminating in the widespread adoption of inflation targeting heralded disinflation, with a high degree of co-movement of inflation throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, particularly at lower frequencies (Chart 3 � top two panels). 3 By the early 2000s, inflation resembled random variations around countries� targets, and cross-country inflation correlations fell � especially for core inflation. While the deflationary shock of the financial crisis and the rise and fall of the commodity super-cycle have boosted correlations of headline CPI, core inflation rates have actually become more dispersed. This evidence of domestic monetary sovereignty is remarkable given the ever stronger cross- country links via commodity markets, goods and services trade, and financial channels. While on the surface the response to the major shocks of the past decade has been a common rates cycle (Chart 3 � bottom panel), the reality has been an unprecedented broadening of monetary policy instruments and increased policy divergence. With the end of additional QE, policy in the US and UK has stopped easing and there is the prospect � when conditions warrant � of tightening. The start of normalisation is set against determined easing of policy in the euro area and Japan as well as now across many Emerging Market Economies including China.  III.         Common linkages Global inflation dynamics are driven by common global linkages through commodities, trade and finance.  Commodities The combination of the oil shock and the absence of credible monetary policy frameworks led to high and sustained correlations of headline inflation in the 1970s. And even though the oil intensity of production has since fallen, commodity price shocks remain an important determinant of the global inflation landscape today. 4 Energy and food prices contributed around three percentage points to the global inflation spike at the onset of the crisis and are currently weighing on global inflation by around � percentage point (Chart 4). 5 However, in terms of policy credibility, the contrast with the 1970s is stark. As noted, correlations between core inflation rates today remain low; and with credible monetary regimes anchoring inflation expectations, policymakers can look through the one-off price level effects of oil shocks. In the UK, for example, despite several months of zero or mildly negative inflation rates, there is no evidence of the development of a deflationary mindset among businesses and   3        Whether this was good luck or good policy is an open question but, for those of you who recall debates of        Jackson Hole�s past, I�m minded to favour policy, particularly given post crisis performance. 4        Energy consumption per dollar of GDP is now 45% lower in the US and 30% lower in Europe than it was in        1980. 5        Similarly in the UK, energy and food contributed over two percentage points to headline figure in late 2008,        and is dragging by a litter over � percentage point in the latest data.    2                                                                                          BIS central bankers� speeches households. Spending is picking up rather than being delayed. Consumer confidence is at its highest level in over decade and retail sales have been growing at well above past average rates. Firms� investment intensions are robust. And inflation expectations remain consistent with our 2% target. 6  Trade Trade creates more complex global inflation dynamics. The ICT revolution has made a great unbundling of production chains possible, and large wage differentials globally have made doing so profitable. 7 This generated vast new quantities of �supply chain trade� (Chart 5), increasingly concentrated in Asia where, by the late 1990s, supply-chain trade had overtaken that of Europe, the US and Canada. 8, 9 All else equal, the powerful strengthening of global linkages through steadily increasing trade has affected inflation dynamics in two ways (Chart 6). First, imports have become much more important components of costs. Unlike commodity shocks, changing cost pressures of intermediate goods take time to work through the supply chains into final goods prices. 10 This means that domestic monetary policy cannot focus exclusively on domestic marginal costs, since inflation at policy-relevant horizons is increasingly influenced by imported cost pressures. Second, there is the possibility that increased competition from overseas might have changed mark ups over costs and how they vary over the cycle. In other words, the slope of the Phillips Curve may have changed. The direction is unclear. Stronger competitive pressures might reduce the pricing power of domestic firms, limiting their ability to change prices over the cycle and so flatten the domestic Phillips Curve. Working in the other direction however, greater competition should raise firms� willingness to re-set their prices, raising the slope. The balance of these effects is an open question. 11 Some prominent studies point to a flattening of Phillips curves across advanced economies. 12 For the UK, however, the evidence is less clear cut. When costs are measured     6      The average inflation expectations of professional forecasters at the two to three-year horizon is consistent      with its historical average. And measures derived from financial market prices, such as from swaps, also      remain close to historical averages. 7      Actually, this was the �second unbundling�, as observed by Baldwin (2013), following the �first unbundling�      brought about by trade itself � which allowed the separation of production from consumption across time and      space. Baldwin, R (2013), �Global supply chains: why they emerged, why they matter, and where they are      going�, Chapter 1 in Global Supply Chains in a Changing World, WTO. 8      See Hummels, D, Ishii, J and Yi, K-M (2001), �The nature and growth of vertical specialisation in world trade�,      Journal of International Economics, 54. 9      Measured by the sum of overlapping trade as a fraction of world manufacturing trade. See Amador, J and      Cabral, S (2009), �Vertical specialization across the world: a relative measure�, The North American Journal of      Economics and Finance, 20(3). 10      See Goldberg, Linda and Jose Campa (2010), �The sensitivity of the CPI to exchange rates: distribution      margins, imported inputs, and trade exposure�, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 92. 11      A flatter Phillips curve has been advanced as one of the potential explanations of �the missing disinflation� we      saw in some countries in the post-crisis period. But other factors such as an overestimate of the level of      potential supply in the economy and the hold of well-anchored inflation expectations may also have been at      work. 12      For example, see IMF (2006) �How Has Globalization Affected Inflation?, World Economic Outlook, Spring      2006, 97�134. and Borio, Claudio and Andrew Filardo, �Globalization and Inflation,� Bank for International      Settlements, March 2006.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                      3 properly � adequately weighting labour and import costs � a significant change in the Phillips curve slope is harder to detect. 13 Given the importance of imports to UK inflation, accounting for around one third of the CPI basket, the Bank of England must consider both secular and cyclical dynamics. As has been highlighted at previous symposiums, from a secular perspective, globalisation has dampened the relative prices of traded goods via a steady expansion in the pool of available labour. The entry of China, India and the ex-Soviet bloc into the world economy in the 1990s effectively and progressively doubled the global labour pool from 1.5 to 3 billion workers. 14 By taking the implication of this sustained, cumulative relative price shock into account, monetary policy has been able to deliver desired inflation outcomes. For the UK, Chart 7 shows that between 1998 to 2006, when core goods inflation averaged around �1.5%, the stance of policy supported 3.7% average services price inflation (which was largely determined by the evolution of domestic costs) in order to meet the inflation target. The questions now are how soon this process of integrating a global reserve army of labour will have run its course and whether, as services become increasingly tradable, this balancing act between domestic and global costs will become even more complex. Today, on top of these secular relative price trends, policymakers also have to take into account the cyclical disinflationary impulse from the weakness in overall global demand. Cost growth is subdued in many economies, reflecting continued slack as illustrated by the co- movement of an estimated world output gap with world core inflation � a glimpse of a �global� Phillips curve (Chart 8). 15 The impact of these forces on domestic inflation depends crucially on movements in the exchange rate. In the face of purely nominal shocks, for example if foreign monetary policy were excessively tight, disinflationary impulses from abroad could be expected to be dampened by an exchange rate depreciation acting as a buffer. But today, in the UK, the exchange rate is reinforcing disinflationary impulses from abroad, with sterling appreciating by around 20% since early 2013. While the appropriateness of moves of this scale in sterling and of a similar magnitude in the dollar may be subject to debate, directionally they suggest real forces at work. One possible driver could be the speed of adjustment of different economies to the financial crisis, with those more flexible economies that took the more decisive action to fix their financial systems seeing the fastest recoveries and largest appreciations. For very open economies like the UK, with a high proportion of imports invoiced in foreign currencies, persistent, sizeable moves in exchange rates matter for the inflation outlook. 16 The pass-through of exchange rate changes through the supply chain into UK CPI inflation is a protracted process, indicative of rich pricing frictions in the market for imported   13      See the discussion in Greenslade, J, Millard, S and Peacock, C (2008), �How has globalisation affected      inflation dynamics in the United Kingdom?�, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Q3. Peacock and Baumann      (2008) find evidence of a flattening of the UK Phillips Curve since the mid 1980s, conditional on treating the      UK as a closed economy. When import prices are allowed to enter firms� costs, however, the authors find no      change in the Phillips curve slope comparing 1965-2007 and 1985-2007.

These effects span the policy horizon, and therefore affect the appropriate stance of monetary policy. 17 In order to counterbalance the scale and persistence of exchange rate movements, UK monetary policy needs to support a continued firming in the growth of wages and unit labour costs. The stronger the drag from foreign cost pressures, the more domestic costs will have to run above past averages.  Financial channels The increased integration of the global financial system has important implications for global and local inflation dynamics. Global financial cycles of the type described by Helene Rey at this Symposium two years ago can amplify changes to the monetary policy transmission mechanism through liquidity and credit creation and destruction. Financial crises and sudden stops can spread weakness and, on balance, disinflation. The global demand shock resulting from the global financial crisis was a dramatic and painful example of the broader phenomenon of increasingly synchronised changes in global financial conditions. At the core of the global financial cycle are globally-active banks, which are key propagators of financial conditions across borders. Looser financial conditions in banks� primary funding markets, normally in US dollars, can encourage a build-up of leverage and translate into increased cross-border lending and currency appreciation in the countries in receipt of the capital flows. 18 An issue at present is the possibility of these mechanisms working in reverse, perhaps in the face of a tighter US policy stance. Capital reversals and dollar appreciation could tighten financial conditions globally, with a knock-on impact on the balance sheets of borrowers with currency mismatches. 19, 20 Some have argued that this confers a particular responsibility on US policy makers. Yet US policy is not the sole determinant of global rates. Many recent movements in US long-term government bond yields have appeared to be influenced by ECB monetary policy actions. 21 This is in line with some recent evidence that funding conditions in other financial centres, notably the UK and the euro area, affect funding conditions globally and, therefore, the cross-border supply of funds. 22 Moreover, it is the divergence of monetary policies itself rather than the stance of one central bank in isolation that points to more volatility in exchange rates and asset markets with associated effects on global liquidity conditions. 23   17      Not surprisingly in light of its importance, issues related to pass-through are the subject of intense work at the      Bank of England. 18      Bruno and Shin (2015). �Cross-Border Banking and Global Liquidity,� forthcoming in the Review of Economic      Studies. 19      Rey, Helene (2013). �Dilemma not Trilemma: The global financial cycle and monetary policy independence�      proceedings of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium at Jackson Hole. 20      Cesa-Bianchi, Cespedes and Rebucci (2015). �Global Liquidity, House Prices, and the Macroeconomy:      Evidence from Advanced and Emerging Economies�, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, Vol. 47, Issue      S1, No. 1. 21      See May 2015           Inflation   Report.

Once implemented, measures to end Too-Big-To-Fail should reduce the risk of extreme spillovers from failures of systemically important firms. Measures such as leverage ratios, higher capital charges on trading books, minimum haircuts for repo transactions, central clearing of standardised derivatives should all dampen endogenous credit creation at the core of the system and thereby limit the amplitude of the global financial cycle. Indeed, the dog that hasn�t barked in the wake of recent market turbulence has been any hint of distress at any major financial institution. On the other hand, while the core of the system is more secure, the system as a whole is less able to provide on-demand liquidity. This reflects the impact of regulatory changes and changes to market structures, including the rise of algorithmic trading and the increased importance of asset management. Over time the Bank of England expects high liquidity premia to persist in normal market conditions to compensate for these developments. 24 The final important global financial linkage is the level of long-term risk-free interest rates determined in global capital markets. In the medium to long term, the interest rate that domestic policymakers must set to meet their inflation targets and keep a balance between demand and supply is strongly influenced, through the integration of capital markets, by such global rates. These are the product of real global factors. For the past thirty years, a number of profound structural changes in the world economy have pushed down on the level of world real interest rates perhaps by as much as 450bps. Researchers at the Bank of England have estimated a decomposition of these changes, suggesting, in declining order of importance: slowing potential growth, the rise in saving due to demographic forces; higher credit spreads, lower desired investment given a lower relative price of capital, changes in income distribution; excess saving in emerging markets, and declining public investment. Collectively these factors could account for the lion�s share of the 450bp fall observed in the past 30 years and suggest that global real rates may remain low � perhaps around 1% � in the long term. 25 In the short run, the domestic real rate that balances demand and supply can deviate from this long-term global level reflecting a range of transitory factors � including demand and supply shocks from fiscal policy, credit markets and exchange rates. It is critical domestic policymakers judge the scale and persistence of these factors and take them into account to meet their domestic objectives. For many central banks, including the Bank of England, these factors suggest that the �equilibrium� real rate of interest � the rate needed to keep the economy at potential and inflation on target � which was sharply negative during the crisis, will slowly rise but remain lower than past averages for some time.  III.         Concluding remarks Recent developments in China can be assessed within this framework. First, to the extent to which lower Chinese demand for commodities imparts a positive terms of trade and real income shock on the UK economy, the MPC can look through the temporary disinflationary impact on headline inflation and concentrate on potentially more persistent effects through trade and financial channels. In that regard, a potential further    24        Monetary policy will have to adjust accordingly, as these developments likely imply a lower equilibrium real        risk-free rate, compensating for the larger credit spread that results. 25        See Rachel, L and Smith, T (forthcoming) �Secular drivers of the global real interest rate�, Bank of England        working paper.    6                                                                                          BIS central bankers� speeches material slowing of growth in China and more broadly in non-Japan Asia, particularly if coupled with material and persistent exchange rate depreciation, could impart further imported disinflationary pressures over the policy horizon. In addition, a persistent tightening of domestic financial conditions as a consequence of increased global risk aversion could re- introduce a headwind to growth and inflation over the medium term. These are possibilities, not certainties. Their evolution needs to be monitored, not taken for granted. And it should be recognised that the direct exposure of the UK economy to China is relatively modest and that the recent tightening of financial conditions comes on the heels of a prolonged period of sustained improvement. Moreover, realisation of some of a downside risk previously identified by the MPC, if it persists, has to be weighed against ongoing domestic strength, underpinned by credible policy regimes and an increasingly robust financial system. In this regard, developments in China are unlikely to change the process of rate increases from limited and gradual to infinitesimal and inert. Indeed, as I said recently, the prospect of sustained momentum in the UK economy and the gradual firming of underling inflationary pressures will likely put the decision as to when to start the process of gradual monetary policy normalisation into sharper relief around the turn of this year. To be clear, that opinion doesn�t prejudge any particular decision. But it does indicate that recent events do not yet, to my mind, merit changing the MPC�s strategy for returning inflation to target � a strategy that already reflects the balance of two large gross effects: namely domestic strength on the one hand and disinflationary forces from the combination of the exchange rate and global weakness on the other. Members of the MPC will continue to monitor a wide range of indicators of domestic economic momentum, domestic costs, and importantly given our discussion today, the outlook for imported disinflation (as part of core CPI inflation amongst others) in determining the precise timing and path for Bank Rate. By doing so, we will retain our monetary sovereignty in a globalised world.

2015-09-22	"Mark Carney: Three truths for finance Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Harvard Club UK Southwark Cathedral dinner, London, 21 September 2015.                                                    *    *     *  I am grateful to Ben Nelson and Iain de Weymarn for their assistance in preparing these remarks.          �All England is an American shrine, full of rich records of the makers of their         nation.�1 None more so than glorious St Saviour�s � Southwark Cathedral � a few minutes south of the river from here. Its connection with Harvard makes it something of an American Mecca. For at St Saviour�s was baptised a Southwark butcher�s son who became benefactor to the university that would bear his name. John Harvard would doubtless be delighted with what has become of the 320 volumes and �800 he bequeathed to posterity: a college founded for the avoidance of leaving �an illiterate ministry to the churches, when our present ministers shall lie in the dust�. From that bequest sprung one of the world�s leading universities. A community dedicated to its motto: Veritas � truth; the pursuit of truth in the sciences, humanities, even economics. Truth to create a better world. But recall Pilate�s question that has echoed down through the centuries from the pulpits of Southwark Cathedral to Memorial Church, �Truth? What is truth?� Indeed, upon arriving at Harvard, students and visitors are confronted with a curious truth, or rather, three untruths. In Harvard Yard sits a statue of John Harvard, seated on a bronze throne, commemorating 1638, the year of the university�s founding. Tour-guides relish in pointing out that, in fact: No-one knows what John Harvard looked like, so it is unlikely to be a great resemblance of him; The college wasn�t founded in 1638, but two years earlier; And it wasn�t founded by John Harvard, but by the Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which first voted to set up the university. The �Statue of the Three Lies� is part of Harvard legend. The Three Lies in question are harmless fun. But they should remind us how deeper untruths can persist, embodied in monuments or sustained by conventional wisdom and mores. We gather this evening almost seven years to the day that the failure of Lehman Brothers shattered conventional wisdom and laid bare three lies about finance. Unlike the statue�s three lies, those falsehoods have had lasting consequences.    1     So wrote F A Mackenzie, a Quebec-born writer and journalist who was the Daily Mail�s travelling     correspondent in the Far East in the early 1900s. See Mackenzie, F A, �American shrines in Britain�,     Chapter XLV in Hammerton, J A (ed.) (1926), Wonderful Britain: its highways, byways and historic places,     Vol. 2.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                             1                                                      ***   Lie I: �This time is different� The first lie is the four most expensive words in the English language: �This Time Is Different.� 2 This misconception is usually the product of an initial success, with early progress gradually building into blind faith in a new era of effortless prosperity. It took a revolution in macroeconomic policy to help win the battles against the high and unstable inflation, rising unemployment and volatile growth of the 1970s and �80s. In no small part due to my predecessors, particularly Lord King, the stagflationary threats in the UK were tamed by a new regime for monetary stability that was both democratically accountable and highly effective. Clear remits. Parliamentary accountability. Sound governance. Independent, transparent and effective policy-making. These were the great successes of the time and their value endures today. But these innovations didn�t deliver lasting macroeconomic stability. Far from it. Price stability was no guarantee of financial stability. An initially healthy focus became a dangerous distraction. Against the serene backdrop of the so-called Great Moderation, a storm was brewing. Debt was building rapidly, with total non-financial debt in the G7 doubling to 300 per cent of GDP between Prime Ministers Thatcher and Brown. In the US and UK, this was led by massive increases in household debt, the likes of which were last seen during the Great Depression. Several factors drove this debt super-cycle including demographics and the stagnation of middle-class real wages (itself the product of technology and globalisation). In the US, households had to borrow if they wanted to increase consumption. �Let them eat cake� had become �let them eat credit.� Financial innovation made it easier to do so. And the ready supply of foreign capital from the global savings glut made it cheaper. Most importantly � and this is the lie � complacency among individuals and institutions, fed by a long period of macroeconomic stability and rising asset prices, made this remorseless borrowing seem sensible. After the reckoning, the ensuing crisis and feeble recovery would look very much like all others that have followed prolonged credit booms. Policymakers quickly disassociated themselves from the received wisdoms of the Great Moderation and scrambled to re-learn the lessons of the Great Depression. That process continues today as central banks contemplate current parallels with the late 1930s. The aftermath of the global credit crunch has been severe. Global output is now ten percent below its pre-crisis trend, and with global nominal growth running two percentage points short of its pre-crisis average, the challenge of deleveraging remains acute. These challenges appear more pressing as some are now questioning their faith in another new era � China�s glide path to global economic hegemony. China�s economic miracle over    2     For an extensive survey, see Reinhart, C and Rogoff, R, (2009), This time is different: eight centuries of     financial folly, Princeton University Press.    2                                                                                      BIS central bankers� speeches the past three decades is extraordinary, and it has helped to lift billions of people around the world out of poverty. However, the Chinese economy�s post-crisis performance has been bolstered by a large build-up of debt, which has more than doubled to reach almost 200% of GDP. As had been the case in the advanced world, the Chinese debt boom owed much to an explosion of shadow banking, which relates to the second lie of finance.  Lie II: �Markets always clear� Beneath the new era thinking of the Great Moderation lay a deep-seated faith in the wisdom of markets. Policymakers were captured by the myth that finance can regulate and correct itself spontaneously. They retreated too much from the regulatory and supervisory roles necessary to ensure stability. 3 That �markets always clear� is the second lie, one which gave rise to the complex financial web that inflated the debt bubble. In markets for goods, capital, and labour, evidence of disequilibria abounds. In goods markets, there is �sluggishness everywhere�. Left to themselves, economies can go for sustained periods operating above or below potential, resulting, ultimately, in excessive or deficient inflation. Yet efficient market forces �should� bring about changes in prices sufficient to equate demand with potential, leaving inflation as a purely monetary phenomenon. In labour markets, there is �rigidity everywhere�. Rather than fluidly adjusting to equate the demand for labour with its supply, periods of deficient labour demand can persist, sustaining mass unemployment and joblessness. Yet efficient market forces �should� eliminate these disequilibria by having wages adjust to ensure full employment always and forever. Monetary Policy is not only a response to these rigidities; it is made effective by them. In capital markets, there is �momentum everywhere�. From bonds to equities to currencies and commodities, past winners seem to enjoy further winning streaks, while past losers persist in trailing behind. 4 Yet efficient market forces �should� eliminate these predictable movements before they become apparent.                                                       *** The belief that markets always clear had two dangerous consequences. 5 First, if markets always clear, they can be assumed to be in equilibrium; or said differently �to be always right.� If the received wisdom is that the market is efficient, then bubbles can neither be identified nor their potential causes addressed. Such thinking dominated the (non)reaction to US subprime and housing booms. Consider that many market participants find it more profitable to anticipate each other�s behaviour than to divine the fundamentals.   3     For a review of this broader phenomenon, see Padoa-Schioppa, T (2010), �Markets and government before,     during and after the 2007-20xx crisis�, The Per Jacobsson Lecture, June. 4     Asness, C, Moscowitz, T and Pedersen, L (2013), �Value and momentum everywhere�, Journal of Finance,     LXVIII, No. 3, June. 5     See also Turner, A (2010), �Market efficiency and rationality: why financial markets are different�, Lionel     Robbins Memorial Lectures, London School of Economics.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                3 The game of guessing what everyone else is guessing (everyone else is guessing�) was familiar to Keynes who observed that too often investors �devote [their] intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be�. 6 This disconnect between decisions and fundamentals feeds market volatility and capital misallocation. Such �beauty contest� dynamics afflict not only sophisticated investors, but also many mortgage lenders and homebuyers, particularly during a �new era�. If house prices can only go up, it�s possible to borrow large multiples and pay off future obligations with the capital gains that will almost surely follow. Such �rational� behaviour fuelled the credit binge that ultimately led to the global crisis. Second, if markets always clear, they should possess a natural stability. Evidence to the contrary must be the product of market distortions or a result of incomplete markets. Much of financial innovation springs from the logic that the solution to market failures is to build new markets on old markets. 7 Progress through infinite regress. During the Great Moderation, such thinking became an organising principle for financiers and policymakers. The latter pursued a light touch regulatory agenda in quest for the perfect world of complete markets first described by the economists Arrow and Debreu. 8 Their world imagines self-interested, atomistic agents, coolly calculating odds over all future possible states of the world, writing and trading contracts with each other, all frictionlessly enforced, all achieving mutually beneficial � indeed socially optimal � outcomes. Of course, markets only clear in textbooks. In fact people are irrational, economies are imperfect, and nature itself is unknowable. When imperfections exist (which is always), adding markets can sometimes make things worse. Take credit derivatives, which were supposed to complete a market in default risk and thereby improve the pricing and allocation of capital. Financial alchemy seemed to have distributed risk, parcelling it up and allocating it to those who wanted most to bear it. However, the system had only spread risk, contingently and opaquely, in a way that actually ended up increasing it. Risk ended up concentrated on the balance sheets of intermediaries that were themselves capital constrained. With the fates of borrowers and lenders tied together via hyper-globalised banks and markets, problems at the core spread violently to the periphery. A truth of finance is that the riskiness of an asset depends on who owns it. When markets don�t always clear, the ultimate owner may be surprised to find what they do own. When that surprise is � or is thought to be � widespread, panic ensues. The impossibility of completing markets was not the only practical problem with the pre-crisis approach. Even if markets were perfect, nature itself is unknowable. Recall that the Arrow-Debreu world relies on people being able to calculate the odds of each and every possible scenario.    6     Keynes, J M (1936), Chapter 12. 7     But economists of a more nuanced persuasion pointed out as far back as the 1950s that this logic is flawed.     See Lipsey, R and Lancaster, K (1956), �The general theory of the second best�, Review of Economic Studies,     24(1). 8     Arrow, K and Debreu, (1954), �Existence of an equilibrium for a competitive economy�, Econometrica, 22 (3).    4                                                                                        BIS central bankers� speeches Then they can trade contracts and insure each other against risks they are unwilling to bear. A moment of introspection reveals the absurdity of these assumptions as a description of the actual world. More often than not, even describing the universe of possible outcomes is beyond the means of the mere mortal, let alone ascribing subjective probabilities to those outcomes. That is genuine uncertainty, as opposed to risk, a distinction made by Frank Knight in the 1920s. 9 And it means that market outcomes reflect individual choices made under a pretence of knowledge. The swings in sentiment that result � pessimism one moment, exuberance the next � don�t reflect nature�s odds, but our own assessments of them, inevitably distorted by Keynesian �animal spirits�. 10 In the end, belief in the second lie that �markets always clear� meant that policymakers didn�t play their proper roles in moderating those tendencies in pursuit of the collective good.  Lie III: �Markets are moral� Despite these shortcomings, well-managed markets can be powerful drivers of prosperity. By financing firms to hire, invest and expand, they drive growth. By opening up cross-border trade and investment they create new opportunities for businesses and savers. By transferring risks to those most willing to bear them, they help households and businesses insure against the unexpected. But if left unattended, markets can be prone to excess and abuse. That is particularly so in financial markets, where means and ends too easily become conflated. Value becomes abstract and relative. And the pull of the crowd can overwhelm the integrity of the individual. Lie three is that �markets are moral� � that financial capital can take for granted the social capital necessary for markets to fulfil their promise. Consider the example of fixed income, currencies and commodities markets, which historically have relied heavily on informal codes and understandings. That informality was well suited to an earlier age. But as markets innovated and grew, it proved wanting. Markets need to retain the consent of society � a social licence � to be allowed to operate, innovate and grow. Repeated episodes of misconduct (such as the Libor and FX scandals) have called that social licence into question. To restore it, we need to rebuild fair and effective markets.   9      Knight, F (1921), Risk, uncertainty and profit, Signalman Publishing. 10      In Keynes (1936), Chapter 12, he wrote: �Even apart from the instability due to speculation, there is the      instability due to the characteristic of human nature that a large proportion of our positive activities depend on      spontaneous optimism rather than on a mathematical expectation, whether moral or hedonistic or economic.      Most, probably, of our decisions to do something positive, the full consequences of which will be drawn out      over many days to come, can only be taken as a result of animal spirits � of a spontaneous urge to action      rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by      quantitative probabilities.� Keynes, J M (1936), The General Theory of Interest, Employment and Money,      Palgrave Macmillan.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                        5 Not markets that collapse when there is a shock from abroad. Not markets where transactions occur in chat rooms. Not markets where no one appears accountable for anything. Real markets are professional and open, not informal and clubby. Their participants compete on merit rather than collude online. Real markets are resilient, fair and effective. They maintain their social licence. But real markets don�t just happen; they depend on the quality of market infrastructure. Robust market infrastructure is a public good in constant danger of under-provision because the best markets innovate continually. This inherent risk can only be managed if all market actors, public and private, recognise their responsibilities for the system as a whole.  True lies So this time is the same. Markets don�t always clear. And we can suffer from their amorality. So what to do with such knowledge? And how to retain it? The longer you are a central banker, the more careful you become in your forecasts. �Irreducible uncertainty� and �multiple equilibria� are occupational hazards; so if you must predict the future, you are tempted to hedge heavily and must modify constantly. But in two areas I�m confident: the Three Lies of John Harvard will continue to be revealed for years to come, and with time, the Three Lies of Finance will come to enjoy widespread credulity again. To resist their siren calls, policymakers and market participants must bind ourselves to the mast. That means building institutional structures that make it harder to act on the lies. Over the past seven years great strides have been made. Take �this time is different�. To guard against future complacency, policy frameworks have been substantially overhauled. The Bank of England has been given formal responsibility to maintain financial stability and has considerable powers to promote it. In anticipation of problems, we have increased bank capital and tightened mortgage standards. We are using our monetary policy and macroprudential policy tools in concert, so that a low for long interest rate environment can promote both price and financial stability. Moreover, when next time proves no different, the financial intermediaries at the core of the system will be on a substantially stronger footing. Their capital requirements have already increased ten-fold and their liquid assets are up four- fold. Their trading assets are down by a third and intra-bank exposures by two-thirds. Though we cannot hope to eliminate systemic risk altogether, reform is ending Too Big To Fail for individual institutions. The combination of eliminating the implicit public subsidy and increasing capitalisation will reduce distorted pricing by banks and shift activity to market based finance. Choice and competition � real market forces � are increasing. Recognising that �markets do not always clear� has spurred several initiatives. Reform is improving risk transfer by untangling the complex web of derivatives and creating simple, comparable and transparent securitisations. The Bank is helping to change the plumbing of markets so that they are more resilient to the failure of individual counterparties, and we are working to understand better the dynamics of market liquidity given changes to regulation, trading strategies and the rise of asset management.   6                                                                            BIS central bankers� speeches The Bank has also overhauled the way we provide liquidity by expanding the range of collateral as well as the number and types of counterparties. And recognising that the instability of markets may mean they occasionally seize up, the Bank now stands ready to act as a Market Maker of Last Resort. And the third lie? In order to help restore trust and fairness, financial reform is re-building real markets. Earlier this year, we published the Fair and Effective Markets Review. It identified multiple root causes of misconduct in FICC markets that contributed to an ethical drift and an abdication of responsibility. A good start has been made in addressing these shortcomings including through changes to compensation regimes, clarifying the responsibilities of senior management and overhauling the structure of some markets to reduce opportunities for abuse. But more is needed. Individuals need to be held more to account for their actions. Doing so will require new common standards, cast in clear language, better training and higher qualifications, and ways to ensure that when employees are fired, their history is known to those who consider hiring them. Firms must take responsibility for the system by improving the understanding of acceptable trading practices. The industry has already taken the lead by establishing a new FICC Markets Standards Board that will establish common standards of market practice that are well understood, widely followed and keep pace with markets. Regulators need to take a tough line on market abuse, including extending criminal sanctions to every corner of currency and fixed income markets. And to consign the Age of Irresponsibility well and truly to history, London, as the largest global market, must lead the development of global standards. With the main building blocks of reform in place, now is the time to take stock. It�s vital that we � public authorities and private market participants � work together to reverse the tide of ethical drift. This cannot be a one-off exercise; we need continuous engagement so that market infrastructure keeps pace with market innovation. This November, the Bank of England will hold an Open Forum at the Guildhall. The programme, published tomorrow, has been developed not just by policymakers and market participants, but also representatives of well-known companies, trade unions, academia, the media and civil society. An online portal for registration will open tomorrow morning, with attendance determined shortly thereafter by a ballot. 11 Debate on social media is already underway, 12 and there will be live webcasts available on the day. The Open Forum is open to everyone, because the UK�s markets matter for everyone. Our goal is to discuss the prospects for market functioning, where regulations might overlap or conflict, and whether enough has been done to build the real markets the UK deserves. Markets that merit social licence and reinforce social capital. In the best traditions of Harvard, we should use the compass of Veritas, so that, when we too are dust, others can build on our legacy, as so many have on that of Southwark�s John Harvard.    11      See www.boeopenforum.co.uk. 12      See #BoEOpenForum.

2015-10-09	"Mark Carney: Breaking the tragedy of the horizon � climate change and financial stability Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at Lloyd�s of London, London, 29 September 2015.                                                      *     *    *  I am grateful to Rhys Phillips and Iain de Weymarn for their assistance in preparing these remarks, and to Michael Sheren, Clare Ashton, Matthew Scott and Professor Myles Allen for their comments.  I�m grateful to Lloyd�s for the invitation to speak tonight on the occasion of the first City Dinner held in this magnificent, eponymous �Room�. Lloyd�s is the bedrock of the UK insurance industry. An industry whose direct contribution to the UK economy is impressive: 300,000 high-paying jobs and �25bn in annual GDP. Its economic contribution goes much deeper. Insurance supports households, companies and investors, safeguarding them from perils they could not otherwise shoulder. It matches long-term savings and investment, financing the infrastructure essential to productivity. With its unique perspective and skill set, insurance diversifies the financial system and reinforces its resilience. Since 1688 Lloyd�s has, in the great tradition of the City, served both the UK and the world, providing protection against the perils of the age; helping enterprise and trade to thrive. From its origins in marine insurance, the Lloyd�s market has evolved constantly to meet the needs of a rapidly changing world. The first excess of loss reinsurance was created here. Modern catastrophe cover was born with your decision to stand by policyholders after the San Francisco earthquake. And Lloyd�s pioneered aviation insurance. 1 With eyes constantly on the horizon, Lloyd�s has remained at the forefront of global insurance. Today, you are insuring new classes of risk in new parts of the world � from cyber to climate, from space to specie, from Curitiba to Chengdu. And you are doing so in market conditions as challenging as any in the last 20 years. The need to manage emerging, mega risks is as important as ever. Alongside major technological, demographic and political shifts, our very world is changing. Shifts in our climate bring potentially profound implications for insurers, financial stability and the economy. I will focus on those risks from climate change this evening.     1   The first aviation policy was written in 1911, followed in 1919 by the founding of the British Aviation Insurance     Association. That venture closed in 1921, with underwriters concluding that �there seems to be no immediate     future in aviation insurance�� www.lloyds.com/lloyds/about-us/history/innovation-and-unusual-risks/pioneers-     of-travel.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                      1 The tragedy of the horizon There is a growing international consensus that climate change is unequivocal. 2 Many of the changes in our world since the 1950s are without precedent: not merely over decades but over millennia. Research tells us with a high degree of confidence that: �          In the Northern Hemisphere the last 30 years have been the warmest since Anglo-            Saxon times; indeed, eight of the ten warmest years on record in the UK have            occurred since 2002; 3 �          Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are at levels not seen in 800,000            years; and �          The rate of sea level rise is quicker now than at any time over the last 2 millennia. 4 Evidence is mounting of man�s role in climate change. Human drivers are judged extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century. 5 While natural fluctuations may mask it temporarily, the underlying human-induced warming trend of two-tenths of a degree per decade has continued unabated since the 1970s. 6 While there is always room for scientific disagreement about climate change (as there is with any scientific issue) I have found that insurers are amongst the most determined advocates for tackling it sooner rather than later. And little wonder. While others have been debating the theory, you have been dealing with the reality: �          Since the 1980s the number of registered weather-related loss events has tripled; and �          Inflation-adjusted insurance losses from these events have increased from an annual            average of around $10bn in the 1980s to around $50bn over the past decade. 7 The challenges currently posed by climate change pale in significance compared with what might come. The far-sighted amongst you are anticipating broader global impacts on property, migration and political stability, as well as food and water security. 8 So why isn�t more being done to address it? A classic problem in environmental economics is the tragedy of the commons. The solution to it lies in property rights and supply management.     2   For instance, the IPCC has stated �Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many     of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia�. See IPCC - Climate Change 2014:     Synthesis Report. Contribution of Working Groups I, II and III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2014). 3   See www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/archive/2015/Record-UK-temps-2014. 4   See IPCC (2014). 5   See IPCC (2014) which notes that the effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, together with other     anthropogenic drivers are �extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of observed [global] warming since     the mid-20th Century�. 6   See, for example, Otto et al (2015). 7   See Munich Re, NatCatSERVICE (2015). 8     The report �Risky Business � the economic risks of climate change in the United States� (2014) suggests that     in the USA $238-507bn worth of coastal property could be below sea level by 2100. Research by     Lloyd�s identifies climate change as an important supply-side issue for food security. See     www.lloyds.com/~/media/lloyds/reports/emerging%20risk%20reports/food%20report.pdf. This is consistent     with the views expressed by Lloyd�s market participants surveyed by the PRA for its report to Defra.    2                                                                                         BIS central bankers� speeches Climate change is the Tragedy of the Horizon. We don�t need an army of actuaries to tell us that the catastrophic impacts of climate change will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most actors � imposing a cost on future generations that the current generation has no direct incentive to fix. That means beyond: �           the business cycle; 9 �           the political cycle; and �           the horizon of technocratic authorities, like central banks, who are bound by their             mandates. The horizon for monetary policy extends out to 2-3 years. For financial stability it is a bit longer, but typically only to the outer boundaries of the credit cycle � about a decade. 10 In other words, once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability, it may already be too late. This paradox is deeper, as Lord Stern and others have amply demonstrated. As risks are a function of cumulative emissions, earlier action will mean less costly adjustment. 11 The desirability of restricting climate change to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels 12 leads to the notion of a carbon �budget�, an assessment of the amount of emissions the world can �afford�. Such a budget - like the one produced by the IPCC 13 � highlights the consequences of inaction today for the scale of reaction required tomorrow. These actions will be influenced by policy choices that are rightly the responsibility of elected governments, advised by scientific experts. In ten weeks representatives of 196 countries will gather in Paris at the COP21 summit to consider the world�s response to climate change. It is governments who must choose whether, and how, to pursue that 2 degree world. And the role of finance? Earlier this year, G20 Finance Ministers asked the Financial Stability Board to consider how the financial sector could take account of the risks climate change poses to our financial system. As Chair of the FSB I hosted a meeting last week where the private and public sectors discussed the current and prospective financial stability risks from climate change and what might be done to mitigate them. I want to share some thoughts on the way forward after providing some context beginning with lessons from the insurance sector.    9    Few business leaders list climate change as a near-term pressing risk. See, for instance, PWC�s annual survey      of CEOs (www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-agenda/ceo-survey.html) and the Bank of England�s Systemic Risk Survey      (www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/other/srs/srs2015h1.pdf). 10   Even credit ratings typically only look out to 3-5 years. 11   For instance, IPCC (2014) Conclusion SPM 2.1 notes that �cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine      global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond�. The Stern review observes that �many      greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, stay in the atmosphere for more than a century� (See The Stern      Review of the Economic Effects of Climate Change (2006)). 12   The Cancun Agreement in 2010 committed governments to �hold the increase in global average temperature      below two degrees�. Discussion of this level has been attributed to Nordhaus (1975). Others, including the UNEP      Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gasses (1990) have suggested that two degrees could be a point beyond which      the damage caused by climate change may become non-linear. 13   See IPCC (2014).    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                     3 Climate change and financial stability There are three broad channels through which climate change can affect financial stability: �        First, physical risks: the impacts today on insurance liabilities and the value of          financial assets that arise from climate- and weather-related events, such as floods          and storms that damage property or disrupt trade; �        Second, liability risks: the impacts that could arise tomorrow if parties who have          suffered loss or damage from the effects of climate change seek compensation from          those they hold responsible. Such claims could come decades in the future, but have          the potential to hit carbon extractors and emitters � and, if they have liability cover,          their insurers � the hardest; �        Finally, transition risks: the financial risks which could result from the process of          adjustment towards a lower-carbon economy. Changes in policy, technology and          physical risks could prompt a reassessment of the value of a large range of assets as          costs and opportunities become apparent. The speed at which such re-pricing occurs is uncertain and could be decisive for financial stability. There have already been a few high profile examples of jump-to-distress pricing because of shifts in environmental policy or performance. Risks to financial stability will be minimised if the transition begins early and follows a predictable path, thereby helping the market anticipate the transition to a 2 degree world. To draw out these crucial points consider the Bank of England�s current approach to the insurance sector. As regulator of the world�s third largest insurance industry, the PRA is responsible for protecting policyholders and ensuring the safety and soundness of insurers. Our supervision is forward-looking and judgement-based. It is risk-based and proportionate � tailored to different business models around the sector � and considers both business-as- usual and whether a firm can fail safely � recognising that �zero failure� is neither desirable nor realistic. Our supervisors take a view of your business plans, risk management, governance, and capital models. Where the PRA judges that it is necessary to intervene it does so sooner rather than later. While our mandate is to protect policyholders � many of whom are local � we are conscious that international competition needs robust and internationally-consistent regulatory standards. Solvency II is a good example. It is a prudent but proportionate Directive, that embodies the core principles of our domestic standards and embeds them more consistently across Europe while replacing a patchwork of local regimes. Another example of how best practice is converging globally is the FSB agreement last week on HLA for global systemic insurers, as well as its support for the IASB completing its new insurance contracts standard. The UK insurance industry is well-prepared for such developments. Forward-looking regulators consider not just the here and now, but emerging vulnerabilities and their impact on business models. That is why the PRA has worked with regulated firms, many of them represented here tonight, to produce for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs a review � published today � into the impact of climate change on British insurers. The Report concludes that insurers stand exposed to each of the three types of risk climate change poses to finance; and while the sector is well-placed to respond in the near-term you     4                                                                             BIS central bankers� speeches should not assume your ability to manage risks today means the future is secure. Longer term risks could have severe impacts on you and your policyholders.  The insurance response to climate change It stands to reason that general insurers are the most directly exposed to such losses. Potential increases in the frequency or severity of extreme weather events driven by climate change could mean longer and stronger heat waves; the intensification of droughts; and a greater number of severe storms. Despite winter 2014 being England�s wettest since the time of King George III; forecasts suggest we can expect at least a further 10% increase in rainfall during future winters. 14 A prospect guaranteed to dampen the spirits and shoes of those who equate climate change with global warming. While the attribution of increases in claims to specific factors is complex, the direct costs of climate change are already affecting insurers� underwriting strategies and accounts. For example, work done here at Lloyd�s of London estimated that the 20cm rise in sea-level at the tip of Manhattan since the 1950s, when all other factors are held constant, increased insured losses from Superstorm Sandy by 30% in New York alone. 15 Beyond these direct costs, there is an upward trend in losses that arise indirectly through second-order events like the disruption of global supply chains. Insurers are therefore amongst those with the greatest incentives to understand and tackle climate change in the short term. Your motives are sharpened by commercial concern as capitalists and by moral considerations as global citizens. And your response is at the cutting edge of the understanding and management of risks arising from climate change. Lloyd�s underwriters were the first to use storm records to mesh natural science with finance in order to analyse changing weather patterns. Events like Hurricanes Andrew, Katrina and Ike have helped advance catastrophe risk modelling and provisioning. 16 Today Lloyd�s underwriters are required to consider climate change explicitly in their business plans and underwriting models. Your genius has been to recognise that past is not prologue and that the catastrophic norms of the future can be seen in the tail risks of today. For example, by holding capital at a one in 200 year risk appetite, UK insurers withstood the events of 2011, one of the worst years on record for insurance losses. Your models were validated, claims were paid, and solvency was maintained. The combination of your forecasting models, a forward-looking capital regime and business models built around short-term policies means general insurers are well-placed to manage physical risks in the near term.    14   See     Met    Office    research    into     climate    observations,    projections    and    impacts     �      http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/t/r/UK.pdf. 15   A Lloyd�s report (�Catastrophe Modelling and Climate Change� - 2014) looks at factors that      influence the impact of hurricanes. It notes the importance of sea-level changes � in addition to      wind     speed   and    tides   �     in   the  impact    of   Sandy     on   New    York.    See      www.lloyds.com/~/media/Lloyds/Reports/Emerging%20Risk%20Reports/CC%20and%20modelling%20templa      te%20V6.pdf. 16   As the PRA�s report to Defra notes, major catastrophe events have often driven innovations in risk management.      For example, following Hurricane Andrew (1992, $15.5 billion uninflated insured losses) and the associated      insolvency of eight insurance companies, the industry developed a more sophisticated approach to assessing      catastrophe risk, and became more resilient to similar events.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                    5 But further ahead, increasing levels of physical risk due to climate change could present significant challenges to general insurance business models. Improvements in risk modelling must be unrelenting as loss frequency and severity shifts with: �           Insurance extending into new markets not covered by existing models; �           Previously unanticipated risks coming to the fore; and �           Increasingly volatile weather trends and hydrological cycles making the future ever-             harder to predict. For example, the extent to which European windstorms occur in clusters 17 could increase the frequency of catastrophes and reduce diversification benefits. Indeed, there are some estimates that currently modelled losses could be undervalued by as much as 50% if recent weather trends were to prove representative of the new normal. 18 In addition, climate change could prompt increased morbidity and mortality from disease or pandemics. Such developments have the potential to shift the balance between premiums and claims significantly, and render currently lucrative business non-viable. Absent actions to mitigate climate change, policyholders will also feel the impact as pricing adjusts and cover is withdrawn. 19 Insurers� rational responses to physical risks can have very real consequences and pose acute public policy problems. In some extreme cases, householders in the Caribbean have found storm patterns render them unable to get private cover, prompting mortgage lending to dry up, values to collapse and neighbourhoods to become abandoned. Thankfully these cases are rare. But the recognition of the potential impact of such risks has prompted a publicly-backed scheme in the UK � Flood Re � to ensure access to affordable flood insurance for half a million homes now considered to be at the highest risk of devastating flooding. This example underlines a wider point. While the insurance industry is well placed to adapt to a changing climate in the short-term, their response could pose wider issues for society, including whether to nationalise risk. The passage of time may also reveal risks that even the most advanced models are not able to predict, such as third party liability risks. Participants in the Lloyd�s market know all too well that what appear to be low probability risks can evolve into large and unforeseen costs over a longer timescale. Claims on third-party liability insurance � in classes like public liability, directors� and officers� and professional indemnity - could be brought if those who have suffered losses show that insured parties have failed to mitigate risks to the climate; failed to account for the damage they cause to the environment; or failed to comply with regulations.     17   Discussions on correlation are not new. For example, a current issue is the extent to which European windstorms      occur in clusters, such as windstorms Daria, Vivian, Wiebke and Herta in 1990 and Lothar, Martin, and Anatol      in 1999. 18   See Standard and Poor�s � �Climate Change Could Sting Reinsurers That Underestimate Its Impact� (2014). 19   In 1992 after Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki hit the US, the price of reinsuring weather risks spiked and several      carriers left the market, leading to a rise of up to 40% in premiums in some parts of Florida. A series of hurricanes      affecting the Bahamas has prompted several insurers to withdraw flood cover for low-lying areas.    6                                                                                               BIS central bankers� speeches Asbestos alone is expected to cost insurers $85bn on a net ultimate claims basis in the United States � equivalent to almost three Superstorm Sandy-sized loss events. 20 It would be premature to draw too close an analogy with climate risks, and it is true that court cases have, so far, largely been unsuccessful. Cases like Arch Coal and Peabody Energy � where it is alleged that the directors of corporate pension schemes failed in their fiduciary duties by not considering financial risks driven at least in part by climate change 21 � illustrate the potential for long-tail risks to be significant, uncertain and non-linear. And �Loss and Damage� from climate change � and what to do about it � is now formally on the agenda of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, with some talking openly about the case for compensation. 22 These risks will only increase as the science and evidence of climate change hardens. Physical risks from climate change will also become increasingly relevant to the asset side of insurer�s balance sheets. 23 While the ability to re-price or withdraw cover mitigates some risk to an insurer, as climate change progresses, insurers need to be wary of cognitive dissonance within their organisations whereby prudent decisions by underwriters lead to falls in the value of properties held by the firm�s asset managers. This highlights the transition risk from climate change.  Transition risks The UK insurance sector manages almost �2tn in assets to match liabilities that often span decades. While a given physical manifestation of climate change � a flood or storm � may not directly affect a corporate bond�s value, policy action to promote the transition towards a low-carbon economy could spark a fundamental reassessment. Take, for example, the IPCC�s estimate of a carbon budget that would likely limit global temperature rises to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. That budget amounts to between 1/5th and 1/3rd world�s proven reserves of oil, gas and coal. 24     20   See AM Best � Special Report: Asbestos Losses Fueled by Rising Number of Lung Cancer Cases (2013)      www.ambest.com/ambv/bestnews/presscontent.aspx?altsrc=0&refnum=20451. 21   See Roe v Arch Coal Inc et al, Case: 4:15-cv-00910-NAB, United States District Court, Eastern      District of Missouri, 9 June 2015 and Lynn v Peabody Energy Corporation et al,      Case:    4:15-cv-00916-AGF,      United   States   District  Court,    Eastern    District    of  Missouri,      11 June 2015. Note that as at 1 September 2015 the defences to these claims were yet to be filed. 22   Loss and damage refers to impact of climate change not mitigated by reductions in emissions. The UNFCCC      Warsaw agreement in 2013 discussed support for measures to address loss and damage. See      http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2013/cop19/eng/10a01.pdf. 23   The largest UK insurers hold or manage in excess of �40bn of CRE and infrastructure assets, and have      committed to further such investments in future. For instance, six major insurers pledged to invest �25bn into      UK domestic infrastructure in 2013 as part of the Government�s national infrastructure plan (see      http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1f74e176-5c41-11e3-b4f3-00144feabdc0.html). 24   The IPCC gives a range of budgets for future emissions which depends on assumptions about other climate      drivers and the level of risk of temperatures going >2 degrees that society is willing to accept. It sets these in      the context of existing fossil fuel reserves. See table 2.2 in IPCC (2014).    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                        7 If that estimate is even approximately correct it would render the vast majority of reserves �stranded� � oil, gas and coal that will be literally unburnable without expensive carbon capture technology, which itself alters fossil fuel economics. 25 The exposure of UK investors, including insurance companies, to these shifts is potentially huge. 19% of FTSE 100 companies are in natural resource and extraction sectors; and a further 11% by value are in power utilities, chemicals, construction and industrial goods sectors. Globally, these two tiers of companies between them account for around one third of equity and fixed income assets. On the other hand, financing the de-carbonisation of our economy is a major opportunity for insurers as long-term investors. It implies a sweeping reallocation of resources and a technological revolution, with investment in long-term infrastructure assets at roughly quadruple the present rate. 26 For this to happen, �green� finance cannot conceivably remain a niche interest over the medium term. There are a number of factors which could influence the speed of transition to a low carbon economy including public policy, technology, investor preferences and physical events. From a regulator�s perspective the point is not that a reassessment of values is inherently unwelcome. It is not. Capital should be allocated to reflect fundamentals, including externalities. But a wholesale reassessment of prospects, especially if it were to occur suddenly, could potentially destabilise markets, spark a pro-cyclical crystallisation of losses and a persistent tightening of financial conditions. In other words, an abrupt resolution of the tragedy of horizons is in itself a financial stability risk. The more we invest with foresight; the less we will regret in hindsight. And there are ways to make that more likely.  Financial policy implications Financial policymakers will not drive the transition to a low-carbon economy. It is not for a central banker to advocate for one policy response over another. That is for governments to decide. But the risks that I have outlined mean financial policymakers do, however, have a clear interest in ensuring the financial system is resilient to any transition hastened by those decisions, and that it can finance the transition efficiently. Some have suggested we ought to accelerate the financing of a low carbon economy by adjusting the capital regime for banks and insurers. That is flawed. History shows the danger   25      The IPCC makes clear that, without this critical technology, the cost of meeting the two degree goal more than      doubles � if it can be achieved at all. Canada is home to the world�s first commercial-scale CCS plant at      Boundary Dam. Other projects rely on government subsidies which can prove unreliable. If companies are      relying on CCS to achieve net zero carbon emissions, investors will want to assess how they plan to get there      � and who they expect to pay for it. 26      The IPCC estimates that additional investment of US$ 190-900bn is required annually in the energy sector alone      if the rise in average global temperature is to be capped at 2C. www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/ Mercer estimates that      additional cumulative investment in efficiency improvements, renewable energy, biofuels and nuclear, and      carbon       capture    and     storage   could     be   in    the  range     of    US$3-5trn     by     2030.      www.mercer.com/insights/point/2014/climate-change-scenarios-implications-for-strategic-asset-allocation.html    8                                                                                          BIS central bankers� speeches of attempting to use such changes in prudential rules � designed to protect financial stability � for other ends. More properly our role can be in developing the frameworks that help the market itself to adjust efficiently. Any efficient market reaction to climate change risks as well as the technologies and policies to address them must be founded on transparency of information. A �market� in the transition to a 2 degree world can be built. It has the potential to pull forward adjustment � but only if information is available and crucially if the policy responses of governments and the technological breakthroughs of the private sector are credible. That is why, following our discussions at the FSB last week, we are considering recommending to the G20 summit that more be done to develop consistent, comparable, reliable and clear disclosure around the carbon intensity of different assets.  Better information to allow investors to take a view An old adage is that which is measured can be managed. Information about the carbon intensity of investments allows investors to assess risks to companies� business models and to express their views in the market. A well-known dictum of macroeconomics is Say�s Law: that supply creates demand. This means that the act of producing new products creates income and profits that ultimately finance the demand for them. By analogy, a framework for firms to publish information about their climate change footprint, and how they manage their risks and prepare (or not) for a 2 degree world, could encourage a virtuous circle of analyst demand and greater use by investors in their decision making. It would also improve policymaker understanding of the sources of CO2 and corporate preparedness. A carbon budget � like the one produced by the IPCC � is hugely valuable, but can only really be brought to life by disclosure, giving policymakers the context they need to make choices, and firms and investors the ability to anticipate and respond to those choices. Given the uncertainties around climate, not everyone will agree. Some might dispute the IPCC�s calculations. Others might despair that there will never be financial consequences of burning fossil fuels. Still others could take a view that the stakes make political action inevitable. The right information allows sceptics and evangelists alike to back their convictions with their capital. It will reveal how the valuations of companies that produce and use fossil fuels might change over time. It will expose the likely future cost of doing business, paying for emissions, changing processes to avoid those charges, and tighter regulation. It will help smooth price adjustments as opinions change, rather than concentrating them at a single climate �Minsky moment�. Crucially, it would also allow feedback between the market and policymaking, making climate policy a bit more like monetary policy. Policymakers could learn from markets� reactions and refine their stance, with better information allowing more informed reactions, and supporting better policy decisions including on targets and instruments.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                    9 A climate disclosure task force That better information � about the costs, opportunities and risks created by climate change � can promote timely responses is not a new idea. Much the opposite: there are already nearly 400 initiatives to provide such information. Existing schemes vary in their status (from laws to voluntary guidance); scope (from greenhouse gas emissions to broader environmental risks); and ambition (from simple disclosure to full explanations of mitigation and divestment strategies). 27 In aggregate over 90% of FTSE 100 firms and 80% of Fortune Global 500 firms participate in these various initiatives. For instance, the Carbon Disclosure Project makes available disclosure from 5,000 companies to investment managers responsible for over $90 trillion of assets. The existing surfeit of existing schemes and fragmented disclosures means a risk of getting �lost in the right direction�. In any field, financial, scientific or other, the most effective disclosures are: �          Consistent � in scope and objective across the relevant industri"

Introduction It is a great honour to give this Cairncross Lecture in Wren�s exquisite Sheldonian Theatre. Sir Alec Cairncross was a celebrated economist whose career bestrode public service and academia. Born to a Lanarkshire ironmonger in 1911, he rose, via Glasgow University and Cambridge, to serve as the first head of the Government Economic Service and later, much more illustriously of course, as Master of St Peter�s College. His work serves as a reminder of how enduring are the most trying economic questions we face. His PhD thesis, eventually published after great anticipation in 1953, concerned British investment at home and abroad during the last great wave of globalisation � a Golden Era for global commerce that stretched from Canadian Confederation to the eve of the Great War. 1 His professional preoccupations included how international capital flows, trade and labour mobility influence people�s well-being. These factors remain uppermost in policymakers� minds as they seek to secure the resilient dynamism we all need for sustainable prosperity. And they are among the factors I want to consider this evening in discussing the impact of the UK�s European Union (EU) membership on the Bank of England�s objectives. Today we are publishing a report that examines this question. 2 I would like to be clear at the outset what this report is about, and what it is not. Our report is solely concerned with how EU membership affects the Bank�s ability to achieve our core objectives of maintaining monetary and financial stability. It is not a comprehensive assessment of the pros and cons of the United Kingdom �being in Europe.� And for the benefit of those of you who join us from the ranks of the nation�s press corps, I say again that this report it is not a comprehensive assessment of the pros and cons of the United Kingdom �being in Europe�! Answering that question involves much, much broader issues. Issues for others to analyse, describe and debate. And even those contributions will only be partial responses to a question that only the British people can decide.    1    Cairncross, A K (1953), Home and foreign investment 1870�1913, Cambridge University Press. 2    Bank of England (2015), EU Membership and the Bank of England, October. Available here.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                1 So if the narrowness of my scope disappoints, I would invite you sit back. Literally. Admire the Sheldonian�s ceiling. Marvel at how Wren�s original design bridged such an expanse with neither beams that could individually span its width nor floor-to-ceiling columns that could support it. Reflect on the allegory in the paintings that shows Truth descending upon the Arts and Sciences, expelling ignorance from the University. While you do, I will attempt my more meagre exam question. The Bank�s very great � yet rightly circumscribed � responsibilities are formalised in the remits of the three major policy-making bodies of the Bank � the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the Financial Policy Committee (FPC), and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). The MPC�s remit requires it to achieve price stability, formalised as 2% CPI inflation, and subject to that to support the Government�s economic policy including its objectives for growth and employment. The FPC works to remove or reduce systemic risks with a view to protecting and enhancing the resilience of the UK financial system as a whole, and is subject to the same secondary objective as the MPC. And finally, the Bank of England�s PRA is required to promote the safety and soundness of individual firms; to contribute to securing an appropriate degree of protection for insurance policyholders; and, subject to that, to facilitate effective competition. Price and financial stability, as well as safety and soundness of banks and insurers, are essential macroeconomic pre-requisites for sustainable prosperity, but they are not sufficient for its attainment. They are the foundations not the edifice. The Bank�s responsibilities are enshrined in statute. We pursue them under operational independence and are accountable to the people of the United Kingdom through Parliament for their achievement. Effectively discharging our responsibilities requires a deep understanding of the forces affecting the UK economy. EU membership entails some of the most important. There are three ways in which EU membership affects the Bank of England�s objectives: ?        First, to the extent it increases economic and financial openness, EU membership          reinforces the dynamism of the UK economy. A more dynamic economy is more          resilient to shocks, can grow more rapidly without generating inflationary pressure or          creating risks to financial stability, and can also be associated with more effective          competition. ?        Second, increased economic and financial openness means the UK economy is          more exposed to economic and financial shocks from overseas. As a result of closer          integration within the EU and, more recently, with the euro-area crisis, this may have          increased the challenges to UK economic and financial stability; and ?        Third, EU regulations, directives and rules define many of the Bank of England�s          policy instruments particularly in relation to financial stability. These must be          sufficiently flexible and effective to manage the consequences for the United          Kingdom of shocks originating at home and abroad. All of these forces are in flux. For the majority of the period since the UK joined the EU, the first factor � greater openness and deeper integration afforded by EU membership � very likely increased the UK�s dynamism. To be clear, by dynamism I mean the ability of an economy to grow and progress. Dynamism is reflected in the rate of productivity growth, the degree of labour engagement, the pace of new business creation and the rate of new innovation. In the period since joining the EU, the   2                                                                          BIS central bankers� speeches UK has had among the fastest per capita growth rates in the G73 has consistently been one of the top destinations for foreign capital amongst advanced economies as well as the top destination for Foreign Direct Investment in the EU. Today, the UK economy stands as one of the most flexible not just in the EU but across the advanced world. Since the crisis began, the second factor � shocks arising from our biggest and closest trading partner � has challenged UK dynamism and made it more volatile. In the aftermath of the crisis, it is essential that the third factor � EU rules, directives and regulation � continues to support the UK�s ability to address risks to financial stability in the future.  2.          Openness, dynamism and stability The UK is an open economy par excellence. In fact, the UK has bet on openness for almost two centuries. A bet that has paid off handsomely. From the repeal of the Corn Laws onwards, the UK has acknowledged that impediments to free trade are seldom, if ever, �first best� responses to the many maladies from which market economies can suffer.4 Where the UK has led, others eventually followed. In time, every major advanced economy has come to embrace openness as a strategy to promote the well-being of its citizens. Today, the UK�s trade totals around two-thirds of its GDP (Chart 1). Its external assets and liabilities exceed ten times GDP. And its share of global Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is around two times its share of global activity, accounting for the largest share of FDI into the EU (Chart 2). Its openness extends beyond the real economy to the financial economy. The scale, complexity and degree of global activity of the UK financial system are unmatched in the European Union (Chart 3). More foreign banks operate in the UK than any other EU country, and more than half of the world�s largest financial firms have their European headquarters in the UK. The UK has the largest global share of cross-border bank lending, foreign exchange trading, and OTC interest rate derivatives. It has the world�s third largest insurance industry and its second largest asset management industry. The UK banking sector is four times GDP and non-bank financial institutions are a similar size (Chart 4), while financial services accounted for 8% of output and around 3�% of employment in 2012. From this real and financial openness flow two important consequences for the UK economy and for the Bank�s objectives.  2.1         Openness and dynamism The first is dynamism. Cross-border integration of goods, services, labour and capital markets increases an economy�s dynamism through increased specialisation, enhanced competition, and greater possibilities for diversification and risk-sharing. Greater openness boosts the size of markets that UK households and firms can access. In turn, trading in larger markets spurs innovation and promotes the adoption of new     3    Per capita growth in the UK was fastest in the G7 1973�2008. Including the period since the crisis, the UK      falls to second, after Japan. 4    See, for example, Lipsey, R G and Lancaster, K (1956), �The general theory of the second best�, The Review      of Economic Studies, 24 1.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                3 technologies from abroad. It also intensifies competition and drives efficiency improvements not least by allowing firms to exploit economies of scale. The openness associated with the free movement of labour can help better match workers with firms, alleviating skills shortages and boosting the supply side or the potential growth rate of our economy. And greater openness can enhance the allocation of capital by better matching lenders with borrowers, potentially financing growth-enhancing investment. Foreign Direct Investment has particular benefits. By creating stable and long-lasting links between economies, it assists economic integration and boosts dynamism by establishing channels for technology transfer and skills improvements. The impact of openness on dynamism is not unambiguous, however. It depends on a range of factors including an economy�s factor endowments, the complementarities that exist between these and its production technologies, and the correlation of shocks between the domestic and world economies.5 Although openness supports dynamism, integration also brings greater exposure to foreign shocks.  2.2       Openness and stability Those observations point to a second important influence of openness on the UK economy: stability. As the UK has become more open over time, its interdependence with other economies, including others in the EU, has increased. For the macroeconomy, this has two opposing effects. First, openness can enhance the investment returns and opportunities to diversify risks of households, firms and financial institutions. Well-managed openness can therefore grow wealth while enhancing risk-sharing, insuring households� consumption, smoothing their working patterns, and augmenting their borrowing and saving opportunities. That insurance helps people plan for the future in the knowledge they�ll have to change their plans less abruptly when the unexpected happens. The flip-side is that openness can change the nature of the unexpected itself, altering the type and scale of shocks hitting the economy. For example, the complexity of financial linkages can grow and become more opaque, creating new vulnerabilities and more severe shocks. And openness has the potential to exacerbate existing distortions or inefficiencies. In times of euphoria, foreign capital can flood in and amplify domestic trends. The speed of its flight when passion turns to panic can then deepen the bust that follows boom. Most obviously, openness ties the fates of trading nations together. That can mean a �second engine� for growth from abroad. But it can also mean a dragging anchor when things go awry across borders.     5   See for example Grossman, G and Helpman, E (1991), Innovation and growth in the global economy, MIT     Press.    4                                                                                BIS central bankers� speeches 3.          Role of the EU in UK dynamism and stability How has the EU affected the UK�s dynamism and stability? Let me begin with the first.  3.1         Role of EU in UK dynamism In some respects the UK is the leading beneficiary of the famous �Four Freedoms� first set out in the 1957 Treaty of Rome.6 These are the free movement of goods and services, capital and labour, enhanced over time through a range of measures to reduce impediments across the EU. So although the UK�s dynamism is the product of many factors including deep human capital, well-developed physical infrastructure, a competitive fiscal regime and the rule of law; the EU has arguably bolstered it by establishing the world�s largest single market with free movement of goods, services, capital and labour. The UK has further benefited from these dynamics by retaining relatively flexible labour and product markets. In product markets, home and foreign firms receive close to equal treatment; the administrative burden on start-ups is second lowest in the G7; incumbent firms receive the lowest regulatory protection in the G7; and product market regulation is light (Charts 5�8). Partly as a result, in 2012 the UK economy created firms at more than three times the rate of the US.7 Taken together, these measures promote competition and spur innovation which ultimately benefits us all. And the UK has managed to combine some of the most flexible labour markets in the G7 with some of the most cooperative labour relations (Charts 9�10). This relative labour market flexibility helps the economy to absorb shocks, illustrated by the experience of the Great Recession. UK unemployment rose by less than in the US, and has fallen faster than in the euro area. Since the start of the Global Financial Crisis, UK jobs have grown 3 percentage points more than the US. Moreover, people�s attachment to the workplace has remained broadly intact. Compare that with the case of some euro members, where youth unemployment in particular has been devastatingly high, and with the US, where there was an unexpected rise in worker discouragement, with many working age adults exiting from the labour market altogether.8 This out-performance is positive for the UK�s dynamism in the medium run. More to the point, that means more people in work, building not losing skills, with real prospects for higher wages and better living standards. That is important because the UK still has work to do to close the gap between its productivity performance and the world frontier, defined by the United States (Chart 11). However, over the broad sweep of its EU membership, the UK�s productivity growth performance compares favourably. And its potential growth is at the top of the class of the major advanced economies. An important driver of that dynamic has been FDI. Since the establishment of the single market in 1992, the UK has been the top recipient of foreign capital in the EU.    6    And now set out in the Treaty of the EU and the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. 7    Compared using business creation rates scaled by relative GDP. 8    For a further discussion of these points, see: Carney, M (2014), Speech at the Trades Union Congress Annual      Conference, September.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                 5 Evidence suggests that the openness of EU economies to foreign investment has improved firm-level productivity both through technology transfer and enhanced management practices (Chart 12). This has likely been complemented with labour flows leading to better-matched skills. Broadly speaking, the evidence suggests that UK has successfully harnessed the benefits of openness afforded by its EU membership while avoiding some the drawbacks of reduced flexibility from which some continental European economies suffer.  3.2         Role of EU in UK stability If the impact of EU membership on openness and dynamism is relatively clear, its effect on stability is more complex. Greater dynamism makes a given burden of debt easier to service, enhancing resilience to shocks. And the common rules and diversification afforded by EU membership bring the potential for financial stability benefits. But there have also been challenges. Greatly increased financial openness, in part associated with EU membership, has made the UK financial system larger, more complex and more exposed to shocks from abroad. These developments reinforced domestically generated vulnerabilities in the run up to the Global Financial Crisis. The UK, along with many of its main international partners, lacked the institutions and tools for managing and addressing them when they crystallised. As a result, when the crisis hit, global shocks were transmitted virulently across borders, doing great damage to the financial systems and real economies of many countries. The UK was particularly affected given its high degree of financial openness. Most recently, challenges arising from European Monetary Union (EMU) have been particularly evident. Our ties are close. 40% of our exports go to the euro area, and major UK-owned banks have financial exposures to the euro area totalling almost twice their capital, worth a quarter of UK GDP. These figures underscore the importance to the UK of further building the resilience of the euro area as part of a strengthened European Union.9 In this regard, the progress made in recent years is particularly welcome. Nonetheless, as highlighted in the European Commission�s �Five Presidents� Report�, the euro area remains �unfinished business.�10 Actions to complete European Monetary Union should be taken with regard to their impact on all members of the European Union. From the Bank of England�s perspective, steps to ensure financial stability for those within the euro area should not impede the achievement of financial stability for those without, including the United Kingdom.  4.          Impact on the Bank of England objectives So what does this analysis means for the achievement by the Bank of its statutory objectives? Let me begin with monetary policy.     9    For further discussion of these points, see Carney, M (2015), �Fortune favours the bold�, Speech at Iveagh      House, Dublin, 28 January. 10   See Draghi, M (2015), �Stability and prosperity in monetary union�, 2 January.    6                                                                                       BIS central bankers� speeches 4.1         Monetary policy Put simply, economies with sustainable dynamism can grow more quickly before running into excessive price pressures. The UK�s greater openness as a result of EU membership provides potential for both greater growth and shocks. The MPC naturally takes these into account when setting monetary policy for the UK. While they have posed challenges at times, the influence of EU membership on these dynamics does not prevent the MPC from achieving its price stability objective. Under inflation targeting the MPC has ultimate control over the UK�s nominal destiny, allowing the flexibility of the exchange rate and free capital flows to facilitate adjustment to global shocks. The precise path of that adjustment is a policy choice we are free to make, within the framework provided by our monetary policy remit. For example, at the onset of the crisis, a large adjustment of the UK�s real exchange rate was necessary to rebalance from domestic to foreign demand, reflecting the severe headwinds to domestic growth from deleveraging by UK households.11 The consequences of this real adjustment for inflation depended on the monetary policy response. The MPC was able to strike an appropriate trade-off, consistent with its remit, between the needs to stabilise inflation and to avoid undue volatility in employment and output. Some have put this more colloquially as �looking through� the effects of sterling�s depreciation on inflation on this occasion. More persistent shocks require monetary accommodation. For example, the euro area�s difficult sequence of internal price adjustments, together with its overall fiscal restraint and tight credit conditions, imparted persistent headwinds to UK growth, and, had they not been addressed, on inflation. Those headwinds contributed to a persistent lowering of the �equilibrium� interest rate in the UK � the rate required to maintain demand in line with potential. That called for Bank Rate to be held lower for longer in order to lean against the disinflationary impulse emanating from abroad. And low real rates have had to be complemented by targeted macroprudential measures to insure against the risks of excessive indebtedness. Both of these points illustrate that the UK�s openness is central to the deliberations of the MPC in formulating monetary policy strategy. But neither openness nor any obligation of EU membership ultimately prevents the MPC from doing its job.  4.2         Financial stability The impact of EU membership on financial stability is more challenging. Given the close integration of the UK financial sector with the rest of the EU, it is imperative that the EU has a robust regulatory framework. This is in the process of being achieved. Through its membership of the EU, the UK is promoting a strong global regulatory framework, and UK authorities have worked in close concert with our European partners to find solutions to the fault-lines of the past. Examples include moves to end Too Big To Fail by enhancing bank recovery and resolution, a solution developed locally at the Bank of England, implemented regionally in the European Union, and now agreed globally through the Financial Stability Board. Given the scale of the UK�s financial sector relative to its economy, the Bank of England also has a special responsibility to the UK, to Europe and the world. The UK must ensure that the    11   See Broadbent, B (2011), �Rebalancing and the real exchange rate�, Speech at Thompson Reuters, London.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                 7 system is robust to shocks and that financial institutions can be resolved in an orderly manner. After all, financial stability is a national responsibility, with the UK taxpayer serving as the ultimate backstop of the UK financial system. The comprehensive reform of the UK�s institutional framework for financial stability since the crisis creates a coherent architecture of national macroprudential and microprudential regulators and supervisors. This is now commensurate with the scale and nature of the risks that the UK�s high degree of financial openness can pose. And it provides the foundations for the UK to remain the world�s leading international financial centre, one which can safely be home to the largest global, systemically important banks and insurers. The effectiveness of our reformed domestic framework for financial stability depends in part on the quality of financial regulation set at the EU level as well as the flexibility we have to apply that regulation to meet the UK�s specific financial stability challenges. In the main this combination has been achieved thus far. However, there have been some limits on flexibility in certain areas, including: ?        a bonus cap restricting the proportion of pay that can be clawed back in the event of          excessive risk taking or poor conduct, thereby weakening discipline from          remuneration; ?        trigger thresholds for contingent convertible capital instruments that some may judge          too low; and ?        a reduced role for national discretion in insurance supervision. While common international standards and effective EU rules should continue to support the operation of the single market, it is imperative that UK authorities, including the Bank of England, continue to retain the flexibility to impose the high standards necessary to manage the world�s leading global financial centre. This flexibility may be challenged by how EU financial regulation evolves. Ensuring the Bank of England has the instruments necessary to achieve its financial stability objective will depend on the EU continuing to have regulations of the highest standards, which strike the appropriate balance between harmonisation and flexibility, and which accommodate necessary national responsibilities, including for supervision.  5.       Principles of a new settlement for financial stability A successful and sustainable Economic and Monetary Union is important for the dynamism and stability of both the euro area and the UK. Since the crisis, many euro-area economies have undergone difficult reforms to improve competitiveness. Adjustment mechanisms to address the underlying problems of the euro area have been built, including measures to create a Banking Union and the development of the European Stability Mechanism, a permanent crisis resolution facility for euro area countries. Although much has been accomplished, further financial and fiscal integration within the euro area will be necessary to put EMU on a more sustainable basis. In particular, closer financial integration requires increased risk sharing in the public and private sector. That risk sharing can be achieved by the development of the more complete Banking Union in the euro area and, more broadly, a Capital Markets Union for the EU. How financial regulation in the EU evolves in future will be critical to the resilience of both the euro area and the UK economy. Closer union between euro-area member states is likely to necessitate further harmonisation of financial regulation across the euro area. By extension, those regulations can affect the rest of the EU.     8                                                                             BIS central bankers� speeches In that light, it is important that any future EU legislative measures, designed to meet the needs of deeper integration in the euro area, do not adversely affect the Bank of England�s ability to ensure the stability of the UK financial sector or compromise the single market. It is desirable, particularly given the weight of the ECB and of the members of the single currency within the EU, that there are clear principles to safeguard the interests of non-euro member states. The future direction of EU financial reform should recognise that the EU comprises multiple currencies with multiple risks. Such principles would enable the Bank of England to continue to ensure that EU membership contributes fully to the attainment of the Bank�s statutory objectives.                                               *** Overall, EU membership has increased the openness of the UK economy, facilitating dynamism but also creating some monetary and financial stability challenges for the Bank of England to manage. Thus far, we have been able to meet these challenges. Our efforts have been helped by the strong domestic framework for financial stability that has been put in place post crisis. Going forward, these should be further buttressed by an evolution of the EU regulatory framework that continues to work for all members of the EU. The increased resilience that brings is a necessary condition for dynamism. And a dynamic, resilient domestic economy will enhance the prosperity of the people of the UK and beyond. And for those still looking upwards in wonderment? The genius of Wren�s ceiling was its inspired interlocking beams, individually insufficient to span the Sheldonian�s diameter, but collectively arranged so that each could support another, perfectly balancing the forces of those pushing down with others pushing up, resting, ultimately, on the foundations Wren began in 1664. And this is the architecture of Europe: a single market whose participants are interlinked, relying on and complementing each other. Just as Wren�s wooden lattice supports Robert Streater�s art, this market network supports the creativity of Europe. Of course, the weight of the ceiling doesn�t disappear but rests on hidden foundations. So too does the single market rely on invisible supports, some of which are the responsibility of the Bank of England and European regulatory authorities. While these foundations have worked well thus far, they may in time need to be buttressed to realise the full creative potential of the peoples of the United Kingdom and Europe.

2015-11-16	"Mark Carney: Introduction to the Open Forum Introduction by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, to the Bank of England Open Forum, London, 11 November 2015.                                                     *     *    *  Thank you, Lord Mayor for your extraordinary service this past year and for your gracious hospitality today.  Welcome, everyone, to the Open Forum. In a building that started its life in 1411 as �a little cottage�.1 And which has become the place to bring people together: Livery companies and businesses, Traders and market makers, World leaders and citizens. Today, we draw inspiration from this great tradition by gathering representatives from across civil society to discuss how to build the real markets of tomorrow. The Bank of England has a statutory responsibility to protect and enhance the stability of the financial system in the UK. Therefore, even if we don�t regulate markets per se, we have a close interest in working with others to create real markets that enjoy the trust of society whilst effectively allocating capital and risk. Markets can be powerful drivers of prosperity and security for all. Financial markets matter. By financing firms to hire, invest and expand, markets drive growth. By opening up cross border trade and investment they create new opportunities for businesses and savers. By transferring risks to those most willing and able to bear them markets help households and investors insure against the unexpected. Indeed markets are becoming ever more important as individuals bear increasing responsibility for financing their retirements and insuring risks. It is vital markets work well - and are seen to do so. Only real markets can deliver. Real markets are resilient. They don�t collapse when the going gets tough. Real markets are fair. Participants compete on merit rather than collude online. Real markets aren�t ends in themselves but means to much greater ends. Only markets that transparently serve the real economy can retain the trust of society to operate; in other words, only real markets have social licence. The crisis and its aftermath laid bare that many of our markets didn�t live up to these standards. At times, some of the most important Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) markets proved fragile, unfair, ineffective and unaccountable. The twin crises of the solvency and legitimacy of finance undermined trust in market mechanisms and the effectiveness of the financial system.     1   Old and New London by Walter Thornbury ('Guildhall', Old and New London: Volume 1 (1878), pp. 383-396.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                  1 It is hardly surprising that only a third of people believe markets work in the interests of society.2 The more people see, the less they like. People trust markets less with age. And yet, most people think markets will become ever more important. And they�re right. As I wrote this week to G20 Leaders, the structure of financial system has changed significantly since the crisis. Virtually all of the net credit since the crisis has been from the bond markets and the size of assets under management has increased by 60% to $74 trillion. Real markets don�t just happen. They depend on the quality of the market infrastructure. That means hard infrastructure, the plumbing of markets that determines the mechanics of markets; and soft infrastructure, like standards and codes that define how market participants should behave. Robust market infrastructure is a public good. But like many public goods it risks being undersupplied. If taken for granted the infrastructure that supports markets won�t keep pace with their dynamism; just as it failed to do so in the run-up to the crisis. We all have a responsibility to stop this from happening again. That�s why I am delighted that so many people are here today, joining those that have already participated in panels in Manchester and Cambridge. I am also very pleased that we will be hearing from many others who are attending parallel forums in Birmingham and Edinburgh. And that people are already sharing comments, ideas and thoughts on social media. For the first time, people who connect with markets from all sides and in all ways are being brought together. Not just bankers, traders and regulators; but companies, investors, workers, academics, judges, trade unionists and journalists. That�s important. Because we all rely on markets and we are all affected by them. And because everyone who connects with markets can help rebuild the real markets we need. The good news is that today isn�t the beginning of this process. Over the past seven years, a huge programme of reform has been underway to fix the fault lines that led to the crisis and to build more resilient sources of finance to serve the real economy.3 The UK has played a leading role, consistent with our position as the pre-eminent global financial centre. 40% of global foreign exchange trading goes through London. Half of all trades in OTC interest rate derivatives. Two-thirds of trading in international bonds. And more international banking activity is booked here than anywhere else.     2   Bank of England survey results. Bank of England survey results. Respondents were asked for their views on     the statement �I believe that financial markets work in the interest of society�. Possible responses were: strongly     agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree. 3   See the FSB Chair�s letter to G20 Leaders, available at http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/2015/11     /financial-reforms-achieving-and-sustaining-resilience-for-all/.    2                                                                                             BIS central bankers� speeches Great strides have been made in making the system more resilient. The banks that sit at the centre of many markets are safer, with capital requirements that have increased ten-fold and liquid assets on balance sheets that have risen four?fold. A new, simple leverage ratio requirement protects the system from risks that we think are low but in fact are not. Banks� trading assets have fallen by a third since the crisis, and their interbank borrowings have been cut by almost a half. Banks� newfound resilience has been demonstrated recently, as they have dampened � rather than amplified � short-lived but significant financial market volatility. And those banks must be resilient because they can no longer rely on the support of the state. This week the Financial Stability Board proposed to G20 Leaders a landmark agreement on the Total Loss Absorbing Capacity which is central to ending Too Big To Fail in the banking system. Once implemented, it will ensure that large financial institutions can fail without disrupting the financial system or calling on taxpayers to bail them out. The era of heads-I-win; tails-you-lose capitalism is drawing to a close. Complex webs of derivatives are being simplified and made safer. We are also working to turn the tide of ethical drift. Market benchmarks have been reformed to end abuse. Most importantly, market participants are being made accountable for their actions. Misconduct will be met with genuine penalties. By holding individuals accountable, authorities are ending the Age of Irresponsibility. The best in industry are playing a leading role, for example, by getting the FICC Markets Standards Board up and running. The Board will establish clearly understood standards, keep them up-to-date with market developments and promote adherence. In parallel, the Banking Standards Board is promoting higher standards of conduct and competence across the UK banking sector. To give these measures teeth, Her Majesty�s Government is extending the Senior Managers Regime to all firms in FICC markets and putting them on a common basis with banks and insurers. Being a senior manager in finance now brings the responsibility and accountability that befits what the best in the industry have long recognised: finance is a true profession. The Bank of England�s role in markets has been comprehensively overhauled. We�re replacing constructive ambiguity with open for business when we provide liquidity to markets. We�re working with others as One Bank to develop markets that support financial stability and the real economy. We�ve revamped our governance and we�re holding ourselves to the highest standards of accountability, including the Senior Managers Regime on top of parliamentary and public scrutiny. So a huge amount has already been completed to make markets fairer, more resilient, accountable and effective. These reforms are essential for the UK to remain the leading international financial centre.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                   3 They are essential not least because the size of the UK-based market-based financial system could increase from six to nearly 15 times UK GDP by 2050. But the journey isn�t finished. Today is a chance to take stock and reflect: not just on our achievements but on what we might have missed, overdone, or simply got wrong. Given the complexity and scale of financial reform, it would be remarkable if every measure were perfectly constructed. Or if they all fit seamlessly into a totally coherent, self-reinforcing whole. Authorities must have the courage to listen, the honesty to admit our mistakes and the confidence to set them right. Because we�re determined not to repeat the cycles of the past when bursts of post-crisis reforms would eventually drift into complacency and cohabitation. When the caravan moved on, markets were left unattended to slip slowly into excess and ethical drift. Today we want not only to profile progress made, but also to spur a continual process of review and reform. This isn�t just about fixing the fault lines that caused the last crisis, but also about seizing new opportunities from fintech and market-based finance. It's about building truly global markets, in the UK and elsewhere, and the cross-border governance and cooperation they need to function well. It is precisely because we don�t know all the answers that we�re setting questions before us today: - What more needs to be done? Are there gaps that will ultimately allow markets to go wrong again? - Are there other places where the pendulum has swung too far, preventing markets from serving                 society               as                they                should? - And are there other changes needed to build the necessary supports over time? We want to hear from those who might question the steps already taken. We welcome new ideas that challenge conventions of how markets should operate, and whose eyes are fixed on the future of markets that will become ever more important. I�m only sorry there couldn�t be more of us here today. We were four times oversubscribed for places. But I trust that those unable to be here in person are following us via the web, and will interact throughout the day. They�ll also be joined by some of the 5000 pupils from the 300 schools who watched our webinar earlier this week. After all, those students will reap the rewards and bear the consequences of financial reform. They will be the ultimate judges of our efforts. Our first speaker today has set out clearly the standards against which those judgements should be made. As he said five months ago: �Five years from now, UK financial services will be the best regulated in the world, with markets of unquestioned integrity and the highest standards of conduct. There will be more competition, more innovation and more players in retail markets � offering customers a better service. There will be new firms disrupting the status quo, and big firms raising their game in response, with Britain leading the fintech revolution.�   4                                                                              BIS central bankers� speeches Please join me in welcoming the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Right Honourable George Osborne to the stage, to begin the debate.

2015-11-30	"Mark Carney: Closing remarks to the Open Forum Closing remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, to the Bank of England Open Forum, London, 11 November 2015.                                             *    *   *  Let me begin by thanking the Lord Mayor and his team for their gracious hospitality once again. The Guildhall really is a fantastic venue, and I want to take this opportunity, as we approach the end of your term as Lord Mayor, to salute you for the emphasis that you have put on the broader role of finance in society, the broader role of the City of London in the UK economy and in the global economy, and your broader contributions to society. City Giving Day is but one example of that, and we are all very much in your debt for your enormous contribution. On behalf of my colleagues, I want to thank the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the European Central Bank for their insightful comments. Let me also thank all of the panellists for their well-chosen, provocative, and effective contributions. I am also grateful to the moderators here today, in person or online from across the country, for helping drive our Open Forum. Most of all, let me thank our steering committee, those 20 people from all walks of life, who put a tremendous amount of time and thought into the sessions. I also want to thank Andy Haldane, our communications staff at the Bank, and our colleagues tasked with making the logistics work � all the way to Edinburgh. Last but certainly not least, let me thank those of you who spent the day with us at Guildhall, those who followed online, and those who participated in our sessions in Birmingham and Edinburgh, Cambridge and Manchester and our many school sessions. Apart from coming up with the words �Open Forum�, I�ve added little to this memorable day, but I have taken away a great deal! Let me spend a couple of minutes on a few of these takeaways. They are far from comprehensive, and only a starter, because part of the point is that we all need to go back and reflect on what we learned and what we�d like to prioritise. The first thing that struck me was the almost universal reaffirmation of the importance of markets. Whether it was the vox-pops in the streets of Leeds or Belfast, the feedback from our event in Birmingham, the interventions here in Guildhall, there was a clear recognition of how important these markets are not just to the economy, and not just in an abstract sense, but to people�s everyday lives. At the same time, the level of trust in institutions and market mechanisms is quite low. As Elizabeth Corley highlighted, there is a disconnect between how we in finance � and I include the public sector here � see the sector and how the general public sees the sector. Interestingly, that disconnect is much less prompted by questions over the health of our banks. Alex Brummer made this same point in terms of a sense of optimism around institutions. That is a good thing because a tremendous amount has been done over the past seven years in order to make banks much stronger. I will not go into all the details, but banks are indeed now beginning to adjust their business models. I�ll add a very clear message on behalf of those of us on the regulatory side to the bankers in the room and those watching from outside: there is no Basel IV. There is no other big wave of capital regulation coming. With the agreement on Total Loss Absorbency Capacity, the last pieces of the puzzle have been put in place. It is true that we do have to make some adjustments to risk weights; and there will always be things to iron out, but I repeat there is no big other prudential regulatory wave for the banking sector. As Andrew Bailey made clear in one of the break-out sessions I attended, the focus now is about greater certainty and adjusting business models to these new realities. As Andrew     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  1 noted, given the scale of the regulatory effort, that means that the business models pre-crisis are not necessarily going to be very effective now. Let me turn back to trust. Why is trust still so low? My sense from the discussions is that trust remains low for two reasons. First, because of misconduct, and secondly, because of a perceived � and, potentially, actual � lack of adequate client focus. The frequent references to misconduct reinforced in my mind the importance of individual accountability, the focus of the Fair and Effective Markets Review, chaired by Minouche Shafik. It also emphasised the importance of the senior managers� regime coming into effect in the first quarter of next year, and the importance of applying it to true codes and standards in wholesale markets, in a manner that market practitioners understand. The people at coal-face � junior traders, investors and asset managers � must understand what a true market is and their responsibility to act in a way that is consistent with maintaining true markets. In terms of a perception of a lack of client focus, I took away two gaps that were raised. The first is a financing gap, which I felt came out during the first panel, and which some economic historians in the room compared to the �Macmillan gap� � the distance between finance and industry being too great. People talk today about an excess of savings not finding a home. In this country, it is felt most in terms of SME and mid-cap finance. Many were struck by the potential ability of financial technology � fintech � to help bridge this financing gap, but I would emphasise that there was also bit of a caution, as I believe Reverend Giles Fraser noted in the last panel. We should not get too far ahead of ourselves, but look to further evidence that it can bridge the gap. I think the Chancellor is absolutely right that fintech has potential both in terms of expertise in finance and capability in technology. If these can be married effectively, we have an opportunity. There were a few specific examples that were mentioned that I would just like to reinforce. First, and as Alex Brummer very rightly emphasised, the opportunities that come from big data and a greater open architecture that is already there. As our Chief Operating Officer Charlotte Hogg would note, the Bank of England is one of the biggest repositories of big data. There is always a question about to what extent that can be leveraged more broadly into the system, and though it is still early days, the Bank may want to consider taking this on as a challenge. Jon Cunliffe raised a separate and important issue with receivables finance, where fintech could make a real difference. Following the crisis, payment terms for companies increased to 120 days and have not come back. We know there are effective fintech solutions to this which leverage off the credit of the payer. In such circumstances, and more broadly where fintech moves further into more traditional banking areas such as peer to peer and other lending, the Bank recognises that we need to think about and take forward a proportionate, activity-based regulatory response. Let me turn to the second gap in relation to a lack of client focus: an engagement gap, if I can put it that way. This manifests itself in a number of ways, as noted during the many insightful interventions during our panel sessions. Perhaps Julia Black put it best when she described the dangers of groups of professionals talking just amongst themselves. This has been part of the issue with financial reform � a sense that reform was a pre-packaged process built on discussions between regulators, banks, and investors, with sympathetic academics adding in their words of support. Part of the reason for our broader discussions today is to ensure we move out of this state of affairs. And of course, once we bring in other perspectives, it changes our own perspective and underscores just how hermetically sealed the industry in its broad sense can be. Let me say a couple of words on this. It should be recognized that the industry has made tremendous strides to address a number of issues. An issue touched on earlier in the day was reporting and accounting, and one of the things the industry has done is to come up with something called the Enhanced Disclosure   2                                                                              BIS central bankers� speeches Task Force. The Taskforce proposed a set of recommendations for banks to develop high- quality, transparent disclosures that clearly communicate banks� business models and the key risks that arise from them, so that people who supply capital to the banks can follow how they make money, how they think about managing risk, and make judgments on the basis of that. The important point was that this was industry-led, and co-chaired by a London-based bank. There was some input from the authorities, but the industry led the initiative, and it�s a model we may use in other areas of finance. I mentioned Total Loss Absorbing Capacity earlier � I won�t use the acronym! I�m aware the full name doesn�t necessarily make it any more intelligible, but this is basically another layer of capital, and the ability to absorb losses in the event that a firm fails. It is more cost effective � so the cost is not passed on to borrowers. And the technology behind this was developed by the private sector, with the authorities contributing to ensure it could work effectively and on a global basis. But it was the industry, once again, that came up with the solution. Further innovations are needed if the sector is to come to terms with the new business models that Andrew Bailey and others have mentioned today. For example, innovations in the way banks are organised that are consistent with orderly resolutions. Separately, and as noted in a number of panels today, asset managers also need to innovate to adapt to the new realities of market liquidity. The increase in the scale of the asset management sector since the crisis has been notable, as has been the emergence of investment funds that offer daily liquidity while investing in securities that only appear liquid. The Bank, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Financial Stability Board are keenly aware of these risks, and we are working to resolve them in an orderly manner. The area of market liquidity is one place where there may be duplicative regulations and scope for adjustment. Market participants should rest assured we have made adjustments in the past where we have gotten things wrong. We adjusted the liquidity coverage ratio. President Draghi noted the joint work between the Bank and the European Central Bank to change securitisation � an example of fixing something we had not gotten exactly right. We will continue to adjust our market operations. Let me move towards the conclusion of my conclusion. The point about reform and review being a continual effort came through in spades. David Kynaston noted that there have been four big bursts of reform in the last 150 years. This one does not need to end � not because we are due Basel IV, or another raft of reforms, but because we will continually adjust as the industry itself innovates. Adjustments will be based on improved engagement with the industry about what�s necessary and conversations with a much wider range of people. Buried in your iPads, under the financial regulation section, is a list of all the current work streams of the FPC, FSB, BCBS, EC, CMU, et cetera � it�s all in there. Of course, there are very few people who know what all those acronyms are and what they mean � and shame on them if they do! This reinforces the point about comprehension, one of the most important takeaways from today. As Jon Cunliffe noted just a short while ago, rather than burying people in acronyms, the responsibility of the official sector is to explain what�s going on, why certain things are being done, and what else is necessary. In other words, as a senior banker once told me early on in my career in the private sector, �If it doesn�t make sense, it doesn�t make sense�. I asked him to repeat it because it didn�t make sense to me at first. If someone in finance explains something and it doesn�t make sense, and if when they repeat it still doesn�t make sense, it�s very likely that they don�t understand it themselves, which is quite often the case, or that, actually, it doesn�t add up.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                      3 And that is a good challenge for us at the Bank as well as the broader official community when explaining what�s happening and how the system works. Lack of understanding leads to disengagement, which in turn leads to mistrust. Let me conclude by thanking the huge range of people across the country who really did engage, who did spend the time here with us today. The long-term reward of course, is a more resilient financial system that better serves the needs of society. In the short-term, I hope you will join us for a quick drink in the Crypt of this fantastic building. For those of you in Edinburgh, Alex Brummer would be happy to stump up. And for those of you at home, I hope you will join us in spirit with a drink at your local pub � put it on the Bank of England as a form of quantitative easing.     4                                                                               BIS central bankers� speeches"
2015-12-23	"Mark Carney: Opening statement at the European Parliament�s ECON Committee Opening statement by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the European Parliament�s ECON Committee, Brussels, 7 December 2015.                                               *    *    *  Mr Chair, Honourable Members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, It is a pleasure to address you in my capacity as Vice-Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board. Maintaining financial stability requires strong policy frameworks, a dynamic understanding of risks, and, when appropriate, co-ordination of individual macro-prudential policies. The need for a coordinating authority within the EU is particularly important, given the unique nature of the single market and its high degree of integration. In fulfilling this role, the ESRB is making financial stability policy more effective across the EU.  1.          On openness in the EU The openness of European member states supports economic dynamism by facilitating trade and specialisation, by enhancing competition, and by encouraging more diversification and risk-sharing. Larger markets mean wider choice, bigger incentives for innovation, and greater scope to realise economies of scale. While openness boosts dynamism, it also increases exposure to shocks from abroad. Financial linkages in particular can create new vulnerabilities and the potential to deepen shocks. The ESRB can help build the resilience to maximise the benefits from openness and minimise the risks it entails. In this spirit, I would like to outline three specific contributions of the ESRB during my time as Vice Chair.  2.          Building stronger macroprudential frameworks The ESRB has promoted stronger macroprudential frameworks across the Union. Specifically the ESRB has issued recommendations to encourage national legislators to establish macroprudential authorities within their jurisdictions. Its Handbook on Operationalising Macroprudential Policy in the Banking Sector embodies practical information on how to set policy using the newly-established powers. The Handbook sets out best practice on an instrument by instrument basis, suggests indicators to guide their use, and outlines the legal framework governing them. It also details potential spillovers. Where it judges that best practice is not being followed, the ESRB can use �soft law� to issue recommendations on an �act or explain� basis to mitigate financial stability risks and curb spillovers. For example, last year the ESRB gave guidance to national macroprudential authorities on how to set countercyclical capital buffer rates. The ESRB will follow up that guidance with a published assessment of implementation in 2016 Q3. With macroprudential policy still in its adolescence, the ESRB is helping it to mature.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                       1 Recent ESRB studies have evaluated the case for using margining to counteract pro-cyclical behaviour in derivatives and securities financing transactions. And this year, the ESRB assessed the value of including macroprudential buffers within the leverage ratio framework. The Bank of England has followed this approach to ensure that the leverage ratio complements the risk-weighted capital framework in a way that makes it robust to cyclical and structural risks. One of the strengths of the ESRB is its ability to harness data and conduct analysis across all EU Member States. In its work on the leverage ratio, the ESRB collected new empirical evidence showing banking sector leverage has been pro-cyclical at an aggregate level in almost all Member States. Average risk weights tend to fall in credit booms and rise in downturns. Working with EBA data, the ESRB found that systemically important banks in Europe typically have lower risk weights and leverage ratios than other types of banks. Taken together, theory and evidence demonstrate the importance of a dynamic leverage ratio to a robust macroprudential framework. Another way that the ESRB has led in identifying best practice and influencing the international agenda has been to take a macroprudential perspective on how elements of the financial system can support long-term prosperity. For example, in its examination of Solvency II, the ESRB has considered how long-term investors like insurers can bring diversity and stability to the system. In my view, more can be done to ensure that Solvency II creates the right framework for long-term investment. The ESRB can provide a constructive and objective macroprudential perspective as an input to Parliament�s review in 2018 of aspects of the operation of Solvency II. Openness puts a premium on shared understanding of risks. The ESRB plays a vital role for the EU, enhancing members� assessment of new and evolving risks. The structure of the financial system has changed significantly since the crisis. Virtually all of the net credit growth since then has been from the bond markets. In tandem, the assets under management have risen by 60% globally and 80% in the EU. These trends will continue as the Capital Markets Union is developed. The ESRB is currently contributing in two ways to more resilient capital markets. First, it is promoting a shared understanding of the fundamental drivers of market liquidity. Second, it is gathering consistent information on the nature and size of the risks associated with market-based finance. The ESRB has unique powers in this regard given its ability to collect information from financial participants from across the EU.1 The ESRB is currently surveying market makers and asset managers as part of a broader study into the risks from a reduction in market liquidity. This work should be completed by mid-2016. The survey will draw out the implications for liquidity conditions, including whether open- ended funds have liquidity sufficient to meet redemptions in the event of market stress.     1   Of course, the ESRB must exercise this power with care and precision. And the case for doing so must be     compelling. But the rapid growth of market-based finance satisfies these tests.    2                                                                                   BIS central bankers� speeches In a similar survey of 143 investment funds, the Bank of England found that, in aggregate, these funds expected to be able to liquidate in one day roughly three times estimated dollar corporate bond market turnover; clearly a fallacy of composition. The ESRB survey will provide a valuable wider perspective. Armed with such insights, the ESRB can help design appropriate policy responses. Stress testing of the investment fund sector can be expected in the future, complementing existing stress tests of banks, insurers and pension funds. The ESRB is also beginning to access detailed derivative trade reports from trade repositories across the Union. By pooling national expertise and leveraging the ESRB�s unique access to the entire set of trades, authorities can better understand the complex webs of derivative transactions and how they could propagate and dampen risk across the system. It can also assess the impact of mandatory central clearing and whether it shifts risks to other parts of the system such as direct clearing banks.  3.          Greater openness can require shared approaches to managing risks In some cases, shared understanding is not sufficient; authorities also need shared ways of managing risks. The ESRB is the only hub where all the relevant authorities are present, including central banks, bank supervisors, and securities authorities. Through our regular dialogue we can establish and update best practice. Consider residential real estate. This year ESRB�s work emphasised how these markets were influenced by structural differences, from Loan-to-Value restrictions to tax treatments, across the EU. Its analysis identified the tools authorities may use to respond to different vulnerabilities, ranging from capital measures to restrictions on debt-to-income ratios and collateral. Key lessons of the analysis include that: 1.          flexibility is needed in both design and calibration of macroprudential tools; 2.          no single tool can combat all property risks; 3.          tools need to be appropriate to domestic circumstances; and 4.          domestic policies are more effective for both domestic and EU financial stability if             their spillovers are managed. The ESRB has built a framework to assess and manage such spillovers, which should be agreed soon and be operationalised early next year. Its central feature is reciprocity � eliminating regulatory arbitrage to give domestic policy greater traction. It will be member led, but, importantly, backed by ESRB recommendations. Compliance will be on an �act or explain� basis but the presumption will be that many exposure-based measures (e.g. LTV, LTI and maturity) will be reciprocated. This is significant. The ESRB has been notified of macroprudential actions 69 times this year, and 173 times since the introduction of the CRR/CRD in 2014. Although many notices are procedural, they show the direction of travel. More countries are using macroprudential tools, creating an increasing need for a �clearing house� that is both comprehensive and timely. The ESRB will also evaluate the ways national macroprudential authorities might apply countercyclical capital buffers against financial exposures from countries outside the EEA � a tool given to the ESRB under Union law. That will further bolster collective resilience against the global financial cycle and spillovers from outside the Union. While risks in property markets reflect national differences, other risks such as misconduct have more common determinants.   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  3 In the past five years, misconduct penalties imposed on EU banks have totalled �50bn. Those costs have direct implications for the real economy. At 5% leverage, that capital could have supported �1 trillion of lending capacity. More fundamentally, repeated episodes of misconduct undercut public trust in the system.2 The ESRB�s work has helped catalyse sensible actions to begin the process to rebuild that trust. First, it has proposed capturing misconduct costs in stress tests to ensure banks remain resilient even under severe outcomes. The Bank of England has followed this approach in its most recent stress test which included and additional �40bn of misconduct costs. These costs were calibrated to have a low likelihood of being exceeded and are therefore, by design, much larger than the amounts already provided for by banks. Second, the ESRB has also proposed tackling misconduct at source by increasing individual accountability. This can be done by reforming remuneration � using variable pay, combined with Malus and Clawback, to hard-wire stronger incentives for good behaviour within firms. The UK is committed to this approach with the toughest remuneration regime in the EU, including the longest deferrals and claw backs. However, the effectiveness of such measures across the EU is being tempered by the bonus cap. For example, in 2013, the ratio between fixed and variable for material risk takers at major UK banks was around 1:3 � meaning three quarters of remuneration was at risk from individual misconduct. The next year, when firms first had to apply the bonus cap, that ratio had fallen to around 1:1, with the overall level of remuneration unaffected. Prompted by the ESRB, the FSB is now examining the impact of various compensation tools on misconduct, and if appropriate, it will recommend improvements to next year�s G20 summit. Reforms to compensation are necessary but not sufficient. ESRB reports have rightly stressed that more should be done to hold senior individuals to account. Prompted in part by the ESRB, the FSB members will share experiences on the role of bank regulatory powers to address misconduct and on approaches to enhancing individual accountability. In the UK, we are implementing a new regime to ensure senior managers right across the financial system are held directly accountable for failures in their areas of responsibility. That will be buttressed by clear code of conduct, designed by practitioners, to ensure high standards are understood by all.  4.         Conclusion All member states, and more fundamentally all EU citizens, have a stake in EU financial stability. The ESRB helps deliver this foundation of prosperity. The financial crisis starkly illustrated how quickly risks could spill across borders, the need for wide-ranging reforms, and a new approach to addressing risks. With your leadership, the reform programme is substantially complete, and authorities are now implementing it to maximise its effectiveness.    2    Bank of England survey results. Respondents were asked for their views on the statement �I believe that      financial markets work in the interest of society�. Possible responses were: strongly agree, agree, neutral,      disagree, strongly disagree. Only one third agreed or strongly agreed.    4                                                                                        BIS central bankers� speeches But durable financial stability requires more than microprudential standards that bolster the resilience of individual firms. It also requires a macroprudential perspective, with flexibility to respond to shocks wherever they occur; with higher standards for systemically important firms; and to increase levels of resilience when risks increase. The ESRB has been helping Member states fulfil these roles, and it remains alert to emerging vulnerabilities. As President Draghi recently described to this Committee, over the coming year, the ESRB will develop assessments of the macroprudential stances of Member States to complement its existing risk monitoring and focus on the risks of low interest rates on financial stability and an abrupt transition to a low-carbon economy. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your comments and questions.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                5"
2016-01-25	"Mark Carney: The turn of the year Text of the Peston Lecture by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Queen Mary University of London, London, 19 January 2016.                                              *     *    * I am grateful to Ben Nelson and Iain de Weymarn for assistance in preparing these remarks, and to James Cloyne, James Talbot and Matthew Waldron for background research.  It is a pleasure to be at Queen Mary University of London to give the 2016 Peston Lecture. Fifty years ago Lord Peston was invited to take up a Chair in Economics at Queen Mary and to found the forerunner of today�s School of Economics and Finance. Anniversaries provide the opportunity to look back and plan ahead. When doing so, it is sometimes helpful to recall Shimon Peres� definition of a young person as someone whose future ambitions exceed their past accomplishments. So while Queen Mary can take justified pride in its long-standing commitment to community engagement and widening local participation, what is most striking are your plans for the future, including to push forward translational research in population-scale genomics, with the potential to bring health benefits to people across the UK and beyond. Queen Mary is clearly a young institution. The turn of the year is also a time for reflection and planning. The beginning of 2016 in the UK is significant in that it marks a turning of a page in banking regulation and a turn in financial conditions. At the same time, in the MPC�s judgment, it did not yet herald a turn in the stance of monetary policy. I would like to expand on these developments today, including what they mean for the UK�s economic prospects. Since the Bank�s full powers came into force a few years ago, we have pursued a strategy: 1.          To rebuild the resilience of the banking system; 2.          To maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy to achieve the inflation             target and support the recovery; and 3.          To develop and deploy a macroprudential toolkit to prevent the emergence of new             vulnerabilities that could derail that recovery over the medium term. We�ve made determined progress in all respects. In particular, we�ve reached inflection points in micro and macroprudential policies, and are able to set out the requirements for one in monetary policy. In doing so, we have increased the prospects of a durable expansion. But the path of policy is not preordained, and continued progress will require both vigilance and dexterity. That�s because private and public balance sheets remain stretched. The global environment is unforgiving. And the supply side of our economy is still healing. Let me expand.  1.          A resilient banking system I will begin with the foundation upon which strong, sustainable balanced growth is built: a resilient financial system. The combination of a radical overhaul of the regulatory framework and years of determined effort has significantly strengthened the UK banking system. Consequently, last month the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) was able to send two signals that the system had turned the corner. First, it has clarified the overall capital framework for banks, providing much needed certainty to the sector. While there are details still to be finalised and complexities to be reduced, there   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                        1 is no new wave of capital regulation coming. There is no Basel IV. Indeed, last week, central bank Governors and Heads of Supervision agreed that work to address the problem of excessive variability in risk-weighted assets � one of the final parts of the post crisis capital framework � would be completed by the end of 2016 without significantly increasing overall capital requirements. Second, the FPC now judges that the system is already within sight of the amount of capital it needs to have by the end of the decade and has the capacity to continue lending to the real economy even under severe stress. The Bank�s most recent stress test underscores these improvements. It focused on an emerging market stress, centred on a sharp slowing of Chinese growth, which prompts reassessments of global economic prospects, falls in asset and commodity prices and increased global deflationary pressures.1 Sound familiar? Despite challenging conditions abroad, the UK financial system can continue to take the types of prudent risks needed to grow jobs and incomes here at home. In short, the efforts of banks over the past seven years to rebuild their balance sheets and improve risk management are paying off. Mortgage rates are at all-time lows. Corporate credit availability has recovered solidly. Lending to small firms is growing again having fallen sharply in the wake of the crisis (Chart 1).

Financial conditions and macroprudential policy The improvement in the price and availability of credit is one sign of the normalisation of the UK financial environment. Another is that, after seven years of deleveraging, aggregate credit to the UK private non-financial sector has begun to grow again (Chart 2). This has not been a debt-fuelled recovery. Aggregate private credit growth is modest compared to pre-crisis conditions, and is just now coming into line with nominal GDP growth (Chart 3).

More fundamentally, it doesn�t take a genius to recognise that a prolonged period of low and relatively predictable interest rates could encourage the build-up of excessive risks. That�s why the Bank is monitoring risks closely and has taken action where appropriate. Targeted measures include: �              limits on high Loan-to-Income mortgages introduced last year, which contributed to                the share of households with very high mortgage debt to income ratios falling back                to levels last seen in the 1990s (Chart 4);2 �              requirements for banks to assess whether borrowers could still afford their                mortgages at much higher levels of Bank Rate; and �              the current review of underwriting standards for Buy-to-Let being conducted by the                Bank�s prudential supervisors.3  Chart 4: FPC action capped share of new mortgages that can be originated at above 4 � times income                       Risk scenario                    After FPC action                                                                                                                  Per cent of new loans         0                  1                 2                3                 4               5                                                Loan to income (LTI) Sources: FCA Product Sales Data and Bank calculations.

Objectives, strategy and outlook for monetary policy The obvious question is, if the turn of the year heralded the normalisation of bank regulation and macroprudential policy, why not the start of normalisation of monetary policy? After all, the Federal Reserve raised rates in December. Might the �special relationship� extend to monetary matters? Of course there is nothing particularly special about foreign central banks� policy rates. What is most important is whether the shocks to which others are responding are similar to those with which the MPC must contend. To my mind, there are some important differences in this regard: ?           First, cost pressures are stronger in the US. American unit costs have increased by             3% in the past year and are growing above historical averages, while unit costs in             the UK are currently rising by around half that rate or at a speed notably below that             consistent with the inflation target.4 ?           Second, the UK economy is twice as open as the US and is therefore more exposed             to global weakness, dragging on exports.5 ?           Third, this also means that pass-through of weak global inflation, compounded by             exchange rate appreciation, is likely to exert a greater and more persistent drag on             UK inflation. Partly as a result, after adjusting for one-off factors, core inflation is             firmer in the US than the UK. ?           Fourth, the stance of fiscal policy differs markedly. The UK is undergoing the largest             fiscal consolidation in the OECD, with the structural deficit projected to decline by             around 1 percentage point a year on average over the next four years, having fallen             only 1/3 percentage point on average over the past three. In contrast, US fiscal             policy is expected to loosen notably over next three years. ?           Finally, the Bank of England�s control over macroprudential policy reduces the need             to use monetary policy to address financial stability considerations. Recall that, despite an expansion that started two years before our own, the Fed has only raised rates to our lofty level of � %. This last point is not facetious. As my MPC colleague Jan Vlieghe argued in a speech yesterday, a variety of structural factors have likely depressed the so called equilibrium interest rate, or the rate consistent with the economy operating at full employment and inflation at target.6 Bank staff have estimated many of these drivers. In my long-held view, rate rises, when they come, are likely to proceed at a gradual pace and to a limited degree for some time. Most economics is at the margin, and the tightening of monetary policy � once warranted � is likely to be marginal for some time. Given all of that, what are the prospects for a rate rise in the UK? Last summer I said that the decision as to when to start raising Bank Rate would likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year. Well the year has turned, and, in my view, the decision proved straightforward: now is not yet the time to raise interest rates. This wasn�t a surprise to market participants or the wider public. They observed the renewed collapse in oil prices, the volatility in China, and the    4    Refers to non-farm business sector unit labour costs in the US and unit labour costs based on the MPC�s      backcast in the UK. 5    Where openness is measured by the share of exports in GDP. 6    Vlieghe (2016), Rachel and Smith (2015), Carney (2013) and Carney (2010).

The outlook for monetary policy depends on three things: the MPC�s objectives, its strategy, and the UK�s economic prospects. Our objective is clear: to return inflation to the target in a way that avoids undue volatility in output and employment. The MPC�s strategy for achieving the inflation target varies over time, and it depends on the nature of shocks hitting the economy and the risks facing the economy. For conventional demand disturbances, including modest changes to households� consumption plans, or for one-off shocks to the price level, such as a one-time fall in oil prices, a relatively rapid return of inflation to the target, such as in twelve to eighteen months, would usually be appropriate. When there are large trade-offs between returning inflation to target and avoiding undue volatility in output and employment, this horizon can be extended. In February 2011, in response to a series of shocks to VAT, the past fall in sterling, and increases in commodity prices, the MPC decided to seek to return inflation to target in around two to three years. Extending the policy horizon made sense given the substantial slack in the economy, which a faster return to target would only have increased.7 At present, the MPC is seeking to return inflation to the target in around two years and to keep it there in the absence of further shocks. We don�t want an overshoot of inflation. This two-year time horizon reflects the need to balance the strength of private domestic demand growth against the sustained headwinds from a weak world economy and ongoing fiscal consolidation. External factors � including a strong exchange rate and subdued global price pressures � can be expected to exert a persistent drag on UK inflation. To offset this drag from abroad, domestically-generated inflationary pressures must rise. But this process must be sustainable; that is, it should not come at the expense of future, excessive volatility in employment and output. The MPC�s current policy horizon of around two years reflects our judgment of how best to balance these persistent forces while implying a slightly tighter stance of monetary policy, all else equal. Since monetary policy operates with a lag, it must be forward looking.8 As a result, monetary policy will continue to depend on economic prospects not the calendar. The UK�s prospects must be assessed in the light of an unusually uncertain supply side of the economy.9 The financial crisis upended the certainties of the pre-crisis years when productivity progressed predictably and labour supply expanded at a steady pace. Productivity growth fell markedly after the crash and, though recently picking up, now seems    7   Indeed, Lord King�s letter to the Chancellor noted that this would also have entailed risking an undershoot of     inflation in the medium term once temporary factors had abated. 8   Estimates of the effects of monetary policy rely on plausible ways of identifying monetary policy shocks. There     is a large literature on this, which seeks to quantify the �long and variable lags� suggested by Friedman.     Examples include Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005), Uhlig (2005), and Smets and Wouters (2007).     Estimates for the UK include those in Burgess et al (2013) and Cloyne and Hurtgen (2014). Such estimates     typically refer to unanticipated changes in interest rates. A challenge for this literature is that, as noted by     Leeper, Sims and Zha (1996) and Bernanke, Gertler and Watson (1997), most of monetary policy is     endogenous, meaning policy authorities move interest rates in response to economic developments, not in     spite of them, as I emphasise later. The systematic effects of monetary policy are more complex to     characterise. 9   For the monetary policy implications, see for example Broadbent (2013).    6                                                                                          BIS central bankers� speeches to be oscillating around a rate below its historical average. And there have been sharp increases in labour supply caused by peoples� need to work to help pay down debts and rebuild retirement savings. More recently, net migration has been higher. Most of these shifts are still playing out and haven�t settled into more predictable trends. To make forward-looking policy today in light of such uncertainties about tomorrow, tracking a broad range of indicators helps not just to give a picture of how the economy is evolving in real time but also to update, in a �Bayesian� fashion, an assessment of prospects ahead. In this manner, being data driven isn�t akin to driving by looking in the rear-view mirror but more like adjusting your speed to the terrain ahead. Although different indicators will merit focus at different times, as I highlighted last summer, three types warrant particular attention at present:10 1.          The prospects for growth momentum in excess of trend consistent with eliminating             spare capacity in the economy; 2.          Evidence of and expectations for a sustainable firming in domestic cost pressures;             and 3.          Developments in core inflation consistent with a reasonable expectation that total             CPI inflation will return to the target in around two years� time. Progress in all three, both realised and prospective, will increase confidence that the initiation of limited and gradual rate increases will be consistent with returning inflation sustainably to the target. In this light, let me turn to recent developments.  Momentum and slack After gaining momentum in 2013 and peaking around 3% in 2014, output growth has been steady during 2015, at rates close to 2%, a little below pre-crisis norms (Chart 5).11 The average quarterly growth rate for 2015 of around 0.5% has disappointed compared to the MPC�s summer expectations of 0.7%. This shortfall reflects much weaker net trade, the absence of a rebound in housing activity, and less robust consumption growth. Nonetheless, private domestic demand is still solid, and household consumption has been resilient. Consumption growth accelerated to 3% in the third quarter of 2015 (Chart 6), underpinned by the strongest real income growth since the crisis and highest consumer confidence in a decade. Excluding the understandable weakness in North Sea oil, business investment grew strongly throughout 2015. Surveys suggest investment intentions remain robust and, consistent with a stronger banking system, accommodative monetary policy, and very supportive credit conditions. Such solid private domestic demand growth can be expected to continue.     10   See Carney (2015a). 11   Moreover, recent revisions, lowered the level of output by around 0.3% in the third quarter of 2015 compared      to the previous data vintage.

2016-02-29	"Mark Carney: Redeeming an unforgiving world Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the 8th Annual Institute of International Finance G20 conference, Shanghai, 26 February 2016.                                                     *     *       *  The global economy risks becoming trapped in a low growth, low inflation, low interest rate equilibrium. For the past seven years, growth has serially disappointed � sometimes spectacularly, as in the depths of the global financial and euro crises; more often than not grindingly as past debts weigh on activity (Chart 1). This underperformance is principally the product of weaker potential supply growth in virtually all G20 economies. 1 It is a reminder that demand stimulus on its own can do little to counteract longer-term forces of demographic change and productivity growth.

That is not to suggest that such stimulus is without value or impact. Accommodative monetary policy can support activity while parts of the economy delever. Monetary stimulus can avoid hysteresis in the labour market. And monetary stimulus can buy time for structural adjustments which shift activity from public to private, external to domestic, and declining to rising sectors. The time purchased by stimulus has been well spent fixing the fault lines which caused the global financial crisis. Derivative markets have been made simpler and safer. Fragile shadow     1    The IMF has downgraded their growth forecast for the fifth consecutive year; and now expects global growth      to be around 3 �% in 2016 and 2017. In part, this reflects a reduction in the IMF�s assessment of global      potential growth to below the around 4% average growth rate in the decade prior to the crisis. At the Bank of      England, our protections are slightly weaker still. We expect PPP-weighted global growth this year to be just      3.0%, a quarter of a point lower than our estimate for 2015.

And the scourge of too-big-to-fail is ending. 2 Most notably, a more resilient global banking system is being built. The dog that hasn�t barked in recent months has been financial distress at the core. This means banks are poised to dampen rather than amplify the impact on households and businesses of recent global financial shocks. Monetary stimulus has also made room for the repair � if not yet the completion � of European Monetary Union. Over the past year, euro-area growth has broadened, though in the ECB�s judgment, it has not yet strengthened to a degree consistent with its price stability objective let alone the expectations of Europe�s citizens. More fundamentally, global growth has disappointed because the innovation and ambition of global monetary policy has not been matched by structural measures. In most advanced economies, difficult structural reforms have been deferred. In parallel, in a number of emerging market economies, the post-crisis period was marked by credit booms reinforced by foreign capital inflows, which are now brutally reversing (Charts 2 and 3). The international financial and monetary architecture has been tinkered with rather than transformed. With the forces of fragmentation now rising in many countries, it will be more challenging to build a truly open, global system. The consequences of such timidity are reflected in the sizeable downside risks which currently plague the global outlook.

(a) 2016 is a forecast.   These shortcomings also explain much of the sharp fall in global nominal growth since the crisis. Since 2007, global nominal GDP growth (in dollars) has been cut in half from over 8% to 4% last year, thereby compounding the challenges of private and public deleveraging (Table 1). In an unforgiving global environment even those economies with resilient private demand, like the UK, must manage policy with vigilance and dexterity.

Renewed appreciation of the weak global outlook appears to have been the underlying cause of recent market turbulence. The latest freefall in commodity prices � though largely the product of actual and potential supply increases � has reinforced concerns about the     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                   3 sluggishness of global demand. And a series of relatively small data disappointments for many major G20 economies have added to these worries. Necessary changes in the stance of monetary policy removed the complacent assumption that �all bad news is good news� (because it brought renewed stimulus) that many felt underpinned markets. And as I will discuss in a moment, several commentators are peddling the myth that monetary policy is �out of ammunition.� Is �the only game in town� over? As a consequence of these developments, investors are now re-considering whether the past seven years have been well spent. Has exceptional monetary policy merely bridged two low-growth equilibria? Or, even worse, has it been a pier, leaving the global economy facing a global liquidity trap? Can more time be purchased? If so, at what cost and, most importantly, how would that time be best spent? These are the questions we should address during China�s G20 Presidency. They must be met with a response that matches the ambition and pragmatism of our hosts across financial reform, monetary policy and structural initiatives.  Recent market turbulence Since the start of the year, risk sentiment in financial markets has deteriorated sharply, stemming in large part from a renewed appreciation of weak medium-term global growth prospects accompanied by marked downside risks. Despite a recent recovery, equity markets are still down materially since the start of the year. Volatility has spilled over into corporate bond markets with US high-yield spreads at levels last seen during the euro-area crisis. The default rate implied by the US high-yield CDX index is more than double its long-run average. And sterling and US dollar investment grade corporate bond spreads are more than 75bp higher over the past year. On the back of these concerns, risk premia have increased across the board, with �safe haven� assets and currencies benefitting at the expense of equities, credit and commodities. In this �risk off� environment, correlations across asset classes are up sharply. Falls in market liquidity have contributed to strains in some markets. In treasuries and gilts, spreads between 30-year yields and the equivalent swaps have risen by over 40 basis points since the beginning of 2015. And there has been a widening in the spread between corporate bond yields and CDS premia which may reflect a reduction in arbitrage as dealers conserve their balance sheets. Banking stocks have been particularly hard hit, down about a quarter on average over the past three months, across the advanced economies, prompting some to question whether anything has really changed (Chart 5). This re-pricing likely reflects first and foremost renewed growth worries. Banks have always been high beta to the economy.     4                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                         Chart 4                           Rising dislocations across credit and fixed income markets    Basis points                                                                                                                Basis points        10                                                                                                                               5         0       -10                                                                                                                               0       -20       -30                                                                                                                               -5       -40       -50                                                                                                                               -10       -60       -70                               30yr swap spread                                                                                -15                                         CDS-cash basis       -80                                         IG skew (rhs)       -90                                                                                                                               -20                       Mar.14                                                                                     Mar.15             Jan.14                                                                 Nov.14                                                                         Jan.15                                                                                                                          Nov.15                                                                                                                                 Jan.16                                           Jul.14                                                     Sep.14                                                                                                        Jul.15                                                                                                              Sep.15                                May.14                                                                                               May.15   Source: Barclays Live and Bank calculations.

(a) UK banks are Barclays, Co- operative Bank, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, RBS and Santander UK.   More fundamentally, banks are out of favour because of a new-found exasperation with their returns rather than due to old concerns about their resilience. UK banks, for example, have seen a sharp decline in profitability since the crisis, with average group-level post-tax returns on equity falling from 17% in 2006 to 6% in the first half of 2015 (Chart 6). Of course, with hindsight, a substantial proportion of the pre-crisis return    6                                                                                 BIS central bankers� speeches was ephemeral, reliant on short-term funding, capital-light balance sheets and massive synthetic leverage. Banks are facing continuing pressures on their business models from a number of sources, including: �           The consequences of a low growth, low rates environment with ongoing private             deleveraging; �           The impact of a new regulatory framework designed to fix the fault lines that caused             the crisis; and �           The effect of determined progress on removing the implicit public subsidy of Too-             Big-To-Fail. Finally, some residual concerns about regulatory uncertainty, particularly in the euro area, may have been secondary reinforcements to the macroeconomic drivers of recent market turbulence.  Financial reform and the state of the financial system However, this is not 2008. The largest cross-border banks are considerably stronger than during prior episodes of market stress. Common equity requirements are seven times the pre-crisis standard for most banks. For global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), they are more than ten times higher. Global standards require banks to hold much higher liquid asset buffers, to strengthen their trading books, and to reduce and simplify the formerly complex web of interbank exposures. In response, banks have built higher and better quality capital buffers (Chart 7), largely through retained earnings, and have reduced leverage. Between 2008 and 2015, advanced economy G-SIBs raised close to $800bn of equity, while almost $200bn was raised by major UK banks, over a period during which these banks� risk-weighted assets fell. It is expected that the aggregate common equity tier one ratio across all G-SIBs, as calculated on the basis of the fully-loaded Basel III requirements, was more than 11% at end-2015, double the ratio in 2009. In parallel, authorities have tightened both the definition of total capital and the requirements on trading activities. Bank funding profiles have also improved since the crisis. For UK banks, liquid asset holdings have tripled to �500bn and, for the system as a whole, customer loan books are now entirely funded by customer deposits � up from around 75%. Trading assets are down by a third and inter-bank exposures have shrunk by two thirds. Moreover, in the United Kingdom, banks have already been stress tested to ensure they have enough capital to cover two severe scenarios: a hard landing in emerging markets, and a UK balance of payments shock.

Policymakers can help banks transition to more sustainable business models by giving the maximum regulatory clarity. With the agreements reached in recent years, including Basel III and the global agreement on Total Loss Absorbing Capacity, the overall international regulatory and resolution framework for banks is now largely settled. The FSB, Basel Committee and other authorities now need to build confidence about the stability of the overall requirements, deliver transparency about the extent to which institutions meet them, and fix some important remaining details. 3 For example, the Basel Committee is continuing to work on elements of the Basel III framework to ensure its overall coherence and maximise its effectiveness. In doing so, authorities are focused on not significantly increasing overall capital requirements across the banking sector. In short, there will be no Basel IV.  Monetary policy By making the banking system substantially stronger, financial reform has made monetary policy more effective. That is essential because the force of the headwinds facing monetary policy are leading some to claim central banks are out of monetary ammunition. This is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed. A set of powerful forces, both secular and cyclical, have depressed �equilibrium� interest rates globally. These forces include demographic change, slower potential growth, higher credit spreads, lower desired investment, a lower relative price of capital, greater income inequality, sustained private deleveraging and lower public investment.    3   See for example the Bank of England�s Supplement to the December 2015 Financial Stability Report:     http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/fsr/2015/fsrsupp.pdf.    8                                                                                  BIS central bankers� speeches Together these dynamics have raised desired savings and lowered desired investment. With more savings chasing fewer investment opportunities, equilibrium safe returns have fallen sharply towards zero (Chart 8 � see also Annex). Colleagues at the Bank of England estimate that these factors can explain around 400 of the 450 basis points fall in global long- term equilibrium rates since the 1980s. 4 The persistence of many of these trends suggests that the global neutral real rate could settle around 1% over the medium to long term.                                                       Chart 8                                 Secular drivers pushing down on rates     Why does that matter? Central banks must set their policy rates with regard to equilibrium interest rates in order to maintain demand growth in line with supply growth and to stabilise inflation. Setting real interest rates substantially above the equilibrium rate would, in time, generate rising unemployment and falling prices. The opposite is true of setting rates substantially below the equilibrium rate. The substantial variance of the equilibrium rate over time means that a 4% policy rate would have been highly stimulative in 1980 but would be highly contractionary today. At the onset of the crisis, as households and firms sought to de-lever, the equilibrium rate fell sharply, calling for reductions of conventional policy rates to unprecedented levels. The necessary easing, however, went well beyond what central banks could deliver with short rates alone. Unconventional monetary policy measures, including large-scale purchases of government securities, were necessary to deliver effective market rates negative enough to mitigate globally deficient demand. In the UK, forward guidance supplemented such measures, ensuring households and firms could be confident that interest rates would not be raised prematurely, helping to secure the nascent recovery.   4   See Rachel, L and Smith, T (2015), �Secular drivers of the global real interest rate�, Bank of England Working     Paper No. 571.

2016-04-05	"Mark Carney: Opening remarks to the �Empowering productivity: harnessing the talents of women in financial services� report launch Opening remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Gadhia Review launch, Bank of England, London, 22 March 2016.                                                    *    *      *  Good morning and welcome to the Bank of England. It�s a pleasure for us to host the launch of the �Empowering productivity: harnessing the talents of women in financial services� report. A series of transformations are sweeping financial services. First, since the crisis, a comprehensive series of reforms have strengthened the resilience of banks. Capital requirements are now seven times the old standards for most banks. For global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), they are more than ten times higher. For UK banks, liquid asset holdings have tripled. Trading assets are down by a third and inter-bank exposures have shrunk by two thirds. Second, the aftermath of the crisis exposed serious deficiencies in the conduct of many market participants. Now, the tide of ethical drift is being reversed and trust in our institutions is beginning to be rebuilt as a result of the conclusion of the Fair and Effective Markets Review, the launch of the Banking Standards Board and the FICC Markets Standards Board, as well as the start of the Senior Managers Regime, and the embedding of new compensation regimes that better align rewards with risks taken. Third, the disruptive possibilities of the fintech revolution are beginning to touch the core of the financial sector. Now it is time for a similar transformation of the diversity of one of the most important sectors of the UK economy. In many respects, Jayne-Anne Gadhia�s report is long overdue. For too long the representation of women in middle and senior tiers of management has lagged that in other leading sectors. For too long, results have fallen short of good intentions. And for too long the financial sector has suffered the economic consequences of this inequality while society has borne the broader costs. Greater diversity � in all its forms, cognitive, gender, background, ethnicity, religion � can help transform the financial sector. Research has shown that companies with a significant proportion of women in senior management positions perform better in part because of some leadership behaviours that women exhibit more consistently than their male colleagues. 1 In particular, women are found to excel at people development, participative decision making, presenting a compelling vision and acting as role models � all drivers of financial performance. 2     1   http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters. 2   https://hbr.org/2012/03/a-study-in-leadership-women-do.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                     1 Research on board membership has also shown that female directors enhance board independence, partly because women bring different perspectives and networks to the table, and partly because they are more likely to ask difficult questions. 3 There is also evidence of a point of critical mass � when there are at least 3 out of 10 women on the board. 4 And it�s well established that diversity encourages debate, leading to more creative thinking, and that heterogeneous teams are more successful at solving complex tasks, particularly when people have a shared goal. 5 Almost all decisions in finance are taken under uncertainty. Even if there is a range of known plausible outcomes, distributions of these outcomes are unknown. This makes it especially important that decision makers are exposed to a range of views, with open debate that includes perspectives that challenge prevailing wisdom. Moreover, when there are judgment-based responsibilities � such as assessing appropriate values and conduct � diversity is crucial. The value of diversity permeates organisations. Sustained emphasis on diversity in hiring and development programs promotes improved values throughout an institution and acts as a catalyst to sustained behavioural change. In its first report on diversity and inclusion published in November, the BBA highlighted progress in the banking sector, driven in part by the Davies Review and important industry initiatives like the 30% Club. 6 Encouragingly, the proportion of FTSE 100 female board directors has risen from 12% in 2007 to 26% in October 2015. The BBA rightly stressed, however, that more needs to be done to raise the number of female senior managers, and, more generally, tackle the reputation of the industry for �pinstripes and braces�. That is why Jayne-Anne Gadhia�s report, brimming with practical recommendations, is potentially so valuable. To be clear, the report�s recommendations are voluntary, they are not regulatory requirements. It is for institutions themselves to determine how best to take forward the findings. In this regard, I would like to commend the leadership of those here today who are committing to implement the steps recommended. The principles, values and recommendations of the Report are familiar to us at the Bank of England. Two years ago, with the launch of our strategic plan, we made �diverse and talented� a central pillar of our efforts to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom. We recognised that, as a public institution, our workforce should reflect the diversity of this country. We saw that given our broad range of new powers and tremendous responsibilities, we needed to work more effectively and collaboratively across all aspects of One Bank. And we concluded that we needed to be more diverse and open to different ideas and strong internal challenge, not only to avoid the dangers of groupthink, but also to harness the best from all of our people. Our focus on building diversity is paying off. In June 2013 we had no women deputy governors and just one female Executive Director. Today, two out of five Deputy Governors, and four out of sixteen Executive Directors are   3     https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/31480/11-745-women-on-     boards.pdf. 4   http://www.catalyst.org/system/files/why_diversity_matters_catalyst_0.pdf. 5   http://www.catalyst.org/system/files/why_diversity_matters_catalyst_0.pdf. 6     https://www.bba.org.uk/news/reports/diversity-and-inclusion-in-banking/#.Vu_NbXJxqUk.    2                                                                                      BIS central bankers� speeches women. Within our senior management cohort, female representation has gone from 21% to 27%, and our graduate intake has gone from 26% female to 34%. The direction of travel is encouraging, but we are far from satisfied. Diversity will remain a key pillar of the Bank�s strategy. Our goal is to attract and inspire the best people to public service. We want people with diverse ideas, willing to challenge and debate, and we want them to feel empowered at all levels, to take the initiative. To support these objectives, we have introduced diversity targets that for the first time are reviewed and challenged regularly by Court. We have two Bank-wide targets for gender. The first is for 35% of our senior management staff to be female by 2020; a two thirds increase from its 2013 level. The second is to have an equal split of men and women in the organisation at all levels below senior management by 2020 (from our current 44%). But achieving these goals isn�t just going to happen. It requires: �           Focussed recruiting �           Active mentoring �           Consistent and comprehensive performance management, and �           A flexible work environment that values diversity of thought Today, each division of the Bank knows where it stands and has plans in place to improve, where necessary. So in this sense, the Bank has implemented two of the Report�s recommendations. The Bank has also recognised the importance of executive accountability for diversity, another key recommendation of Jayne-Anne Gadhia�s report. Charlotte Hogg, our COO, oversees the Bank-wide diversity initiatives under our Senior Managers� responsibilities. The Bank�s commitment to diversity cascades through the organisation. Our diversity goals now form an explicit part of the objectives of each Executive and the management of individual directorates. Our recruitment process is open and transparent to all, including for senior appointments. The Bank has also been focussing heavily on how to create the right environment to achieve these targets. We are looking closely at what drives performance, differentiates talent, motivates the right behaviours, and creates barriers to success. We have made a strong commitment to flexible working at all levels of the organisation. Over 11% of our staff are employed on a formalised flexible working arrangement. In a recent survey, almost two thirds felt that they had a good balance between their work and personal life. Encouragingly three quarters believe that the Bank takes diversity seriously. Our Women in the Bank network set up a mentoring programme, which is now in its second year. This is complimented by the work of some of our other thriving staff networks � our Bank of England Ethnic Minority (BEEM) network for example has established a �building bridges�, reciprocal mentoring programme � designed to foster relationships, networks and understanding between senior management and more junior BAME colleagues. We also have an LGBT network working hard to promote understanding, increase awareness and break down barriers. Our broader leadership training programme emphasises unconscious bias training to ensure diversity can flourish and progress. This training is part of our broader focus on values. Values count heavily when assessing performance and reward. All managers � including myself � are assessed by colleagues on their values and behaviours � with direct and explicit feedback.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                 3 We are monitoring the effect of all of these changes, including through regular staff surveys. We are aiming for further significant improvement in how our staff perceive the Bank�s support for diversity initiatives and goals over the next two years. There is more to do to reach our medium-term target, but we are encouraged by the momentum that we�ve established, we believe we have the right plan in place, and are heartened to see that our approach chimes with the conclusions in today�s report. Finally, we are conscious that sustained effort across the financial service sector will be self- reinforcing; we will all benefit from each other�s progress. So without further ado, I will pass over to the Economic Secretary to the Treasury so that she may tell you more about the Report and the broader initiative it supports.     4                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches"
2016-05-23	"Mark Carney: The Sustainable Development Goal imperative Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the United Nations General Assembly, High-Level Thematic Debate on Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, New York City, 21 April 2016.                                                      *     *     *  1.          The SDG imperative The Sustainable Development Goals are a moral imperative, with objectives that include nothing less than ending poverty, fighting inequality and injustice, and tackling climate change. 1 The SDGs are also an economic imperative. Their achievement would mean greater productivity, increased labour supply and ultimately stronger growth. In short, they could pull the global economy out of its current malaise of secular stagnation.  2.          The scale of investment required to achieve the SDGs is immense Achieving the SDGs will require both a step change in the quantum of investment and a marked reorientation of its destination. Over the next 15 years, the global population is expected to grow by just over a billion. 2 Another one and a half billion people are expected to urbanise. 3 Although moving to a low-carbon future will not necessarily require substantially more investment than business as usual, 4 it will require a radical re-focusing of that investment from high- to lower carbon technologies. Overall, it is estimated investments of between US$5 and $7 trillion a year are needed for infrastructure, clean energy, water, sanitation, agriculture, and the other SDGs. 5 This is significant but achievable.  3.          Building the financial system we need to deliver this investment While they are important catalysts, private niches, like social impact investing, or public sources, like Multilateral Development Banks won�t be sufficient. Achieving the SDGs will require mainstream finance. To get enough finance in the right places will require more than just fixing the fault lines that caused the last crisis.   1    At the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015, world leaders adopted the 2030      Agenda for Sustainable Development, which included a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).      The SDGs aim to end poverty, hunger and inequality, support action on climate change, improve access to      health and education, and build strong institutions and partnerships, over the next 15 years. For further detail      on the goals, see www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sdgoverview/ 2    Population growth figures from United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population      Division, �World Population Prospects: The 2015 Revision�. 3    Urbanisation growth figures from United Nations Population Fund, www.unfpa.org/urbanization 4    See New Climate Economy �Infrastructure investment needs of a low carbon scenario� (2014), which      estimates that there are infrastructure investment needs totalling approximately US$90 trillion between 2015      and 2030, in the context of a growing population and increasing urbanisation. It is estimated that adopting a      low-carbon pathway increases these costs by 5%. 5    See UNCTAD �World Investment Report� (2014), which estimates that this is the annual amount of investment      required to meet the SDGs by 2030.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                      1 We need to build a new system � one that delivers sustainable investment flows, based on both resilient market-based, and robust bank-based, finance. We need finance for the long term. We need a financial system that is F-A-I-R: that is Fair, Aligned, Inclusive and Resilient. Let me expand briefly on each, beginning with fairness itself.  (i)           Fair The twin crises of solvency and legitimacy undermined trust in market mechanisms and the effectiveness of the financial system. Banks were undercapitalised, mismanaged and operated in a privileged heads-I-win-tails-you-lose bubble. In parallel, there was widespread rigging of some markets for personal gain. By replacing such implicit privilege with the full discipline of the market, social capital is now being rebuilt and economic dynamism restored. G20 leaders have endorsed a wide range of measures to end too-big-to-fail in banking. The Financial Stability Board 6 is now working on a series of initiatives to make the system more fair and effective, including examining governance and compensation arrangements to ensure they promote good, and punish bad, behaviour. 7 In the UK, authorities are pursuing reforms that will increase individual accountability, particularly in wholesale financial markets. 8 Such initiatives are beginning to turn the tide of ethical drift which has plagued the system and would hold back the SDGs if left unchecked.  (ii)          Aligned Aligning incentives will increase finance�s potential to support the SDGs. Alignment requires transparency. Consider the example of climate change. Financial policymakers will not drive the transition to a low-carbon economy. Only Governments can solve the Tragedy of the Horizon. 9 Financial policymakers can amplify the impacts of those decisions, while ensuring the financial system remains resilient during the transition. With respect to climate, our role is to develop the frameworks for markets to adjust efficiently. Financing the de-carbonisation of our economy is a major opportunity for investors. It implies a sweeping reallocation of resources and a technological revolution, with investment in     6      The FSB brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability from the G20 and other major        financial centres, international financial institutions and standard-setters. The FSB also conducts outreach with        65 other jurisdictions through its six regional consultative groups. 7      As summarised in the �FSB Chair�s letter to G20 Ministers and Governors on Financial Reforms � Progress on        the Work Plan for the Hangzhou Summit� (February 2016), the FSB is working on reducing misconduct risk,        including exchanging best practices on governance frameworks and potentially developing a supervisory        toolkit or guidance; examining the effectiveness of post crisis reforms to compensation and whether        disincentives to misconduct should be strengthened; and sharing national experiences on bank regulators�        enforcement powers. 8      See Bank of England �Fair and Effective Markets Review � Final Report� (June 2015), which sets out        recommendations to help restore trust in the wholesale Fixed Income, Currency and Commodity (FICC)        markets including: raising standards, professionalism and accountability of individuals; improving the quality,        clarity and understanding of FICC trading practices by firms; strengthening the regulation of FICC markets by        UK regulators; and improving international standards in this area. 9      See Carney (2015) �Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon � climate change and financial stability�.    2                                                                                              BIS central bankers� speeches long-term infrastructure assets at roughly quadruple the present rate. 10 Transparency is critical to recognising the risks and seizing the opportunities of this transition. Improved disclosure is necessary to reveal how the valuations of companies that produce and use fossil fuels might change over time. It will expose the likely future cost of doing business, of paying for emissions and of tighter regulation. By doing so, it will build a �market� in the transition to a 2 degree world, allowing firms and market participants to take a view on the transition path. With improved disclosure, climate sceptics and evangelists, techno-optimists and pessimists, alike will be able to back their convictions with capital. The current fragmented reporting practices prevent investors, creditors and underwriters from taking these decisions on a fully informed basis. That�s why, at the request of G20, the FSB established an industry-led Task Force at COP21. Chaired by Michael Bloomberg, it is in the process of developing consistent, comparable, reliable and clear disclosures around climate-related financial risks. The Task Force has just published its phase 1 report for public consultation in advance of its final recommendations to G20 Leaders over the next year. 11 Improved private disclosure will also support public climate action. Better information will allow policymakers to assess companies� speed of adjustment relative to countries� nationally determined contributions (NDCs). It will support more informed policies, including early responses if there are clear shortfalls. Virtuous circles could be more quickly established. If Governments build credibility by implementing their NDCs, this will raise the probability of further action to achieve 2 degrees. Markets can then do what they do best and pull forward that adjustment. Early awareness of the risks and opportunities associated with a low-carbon economy will attract mainstream institutional capital. That impact will be maximised if there are the right vehicles. In this regard, green bonds have the potential to align the interests of issuers and investors. To investors, green bonds offer a stable, rated and liquid investment with long duration. To issuers, they could tap the US$100 trillion global institutional fixed income investor base. Moreover, the shift to the capital markets from banks will free up limited bank balance sheet capacity for early-stage project financing and other important infrastructure lending. At present, with less than one percent of outstanding bonds globally being �green�, the G20 is considering initiatives to catalyse this market, including: �        Developing a �term sheet� of internationally recognised standardised terms and          conditions to make issuance more efficient; �        Creating voluntary certification and validation frameworks to give certainty to issuers          and investors that a project is �green�; �        Integrating environmental risk and green certification into credit ratings; �        Developing green bond indices to unlock the potential power of passively managed          investments; �        Standardising and harmonising principles for green bond listings to promote resilient          and efficient trading and adequate liquidity; and   10   The IPCC estimates that additional investment of US$190�900bn is required annually in the energy sector      alone if the rise in average global temperature is to be capped at 2C. www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/ Mercer      estimates that additional cumulative investment in efficiency improvements, renewable energy, biofuels and      nuclear, and carbon capture and storage could be in the range of US$3-5 trillion by 2030.      www.mercer.com/insights/point/2014/climate-change-scenarios-implications-for-strategic-asset-allocation.html 11   See the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures �Phase 1 Report and Public Consultation�      available at www.fsb-tcfd.org/phase1report/    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                  3 �            Evaluating mechanisms for consistent, transparent dispute resolution processes. We all know the paradox that, as climate risks are a function of cumulative emissions, earlier action will mean less costly adjustment. Better climate disclosure and an effective green bond market will mean more investment with foresight and less regret in hindsight.  (iii)        Inclusive Inclusiveness is at the heart of the SDGs, and it must be at the heart of financial reform. However, recent years have seen a worrying decline in correspondent banking services, with local banks and money service businesses in numerous regions losing access to the global banking system. 12 The impact, in terms of unfulfilled economic potential, lost access to finance, and the break on sustainable development, is more than financial. Financial abandonment also has social, economic and security consequences. Communities that become financially excluded become vulnerable, particularly where lost banking services cut off income flows from remittances. Our shared challenge is to combat money laundering and terrorist financing while reversing financial abandonment. These aims are entirely compatible. Keeping flows inside the financial system, and subject to stringent due diligence against clearly articulated standards, rather than forcing them underground is the way to ensure that the financial sector continues to serve real economies around the world. To this end, the FSB, the World Bank and the IMF are implementing the four-point action plan endorsed by G20 Leaders. It is: (1)          Assessing the dimensions and implications of the issue; (2)          Clarifying regulatory expectations by working with the FATF and relevant countries; (3)          Expanding capacity through technical assistance in those jurisdictions whose firms              have lost correspondent banking services; and (4)          Strengthening tools for due diligence by correspondent banks. These efforts to reverse financial exclusion from the global system from termination of correspondent banking relationships can be complemented by greater use of financial technology to promote inclusion. Over the past decade, mobile and web-based payment providers have dramatically expanded access to payment services, particularly in developing countries. Consider Vodafone�s M-PESA since its launch in 2007. It has reached 23.4m customers across 11 countries, many of whom do not have bank accounts. 13 Meanwhile alternative lending models have opened up access to credit and investment. Examples include Faircent in India, which aims to provide credit on demand for all Indians, and Biva in Brazil which seeks to operate in regions traditionally underserved by banks. 14     12    In responding to a recent World Bank survey, whose results are summarised in its October 2015 �Report on       the G20 survey on de-risking activities in the remittance market�, half of banking authorities, three quarters of       large banks and a majority of local and regional respondent banks reported a decline in correspondent       banking relations. 13    Data from M-PESA, http://www.vodafone.com/content/index/media/vodafone-group-releases/2015/mpesa-       ghana.html 14    Data from Peer & Social Lending, http://peersociallending.com/investing/peer-to-peer-lending-sites-16-of-the-       worlds-best/    4                                                                                             BIS central bankers� speeches If fully realised, recent developments � including expanded use of legal entity identifiers, know-your-customer utilities and even potentially distributed ledger technology � have the potential to restore correspondent banking services and remittance flows. Financial technologies can redraw the parameters of the financial system and promote inclusivity and growth. To promote sustainable growth and poverty reduction, this must not come at the cost of less resilience. As such, the FSB is working to understand better both the potential benefits and risks technology poses to the financial system.  (iv)        Resilient I want to conclude by underscoring how fundamental the FSB�s core mission is to achieving the SDGs. Without an open, global financial system that can support sustainable cross- border investment flows, there can be no sustained economic growth or financial contribution sufficient to achieve the development goals. In this way, the FSB�s core work complements broader G20 initiatives to promote in inclusion, infrastructure, innovation and green growth. Inevitably, since the crisis, the FSB�s principal focus has been on agreeing reforms to fix the fault lines in banking that led to that crisis. Given the enormous progress made, we are now increasingly concentrating on building a diverse and resilient system that will harness the potential of market-based finance. Since the crisis, market-based finance has grown significantly, bringing new sources of credit and investment, promoting financial openness and international capital flows, and adding welcome diversity to the system. Emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) have particularly benefited from these developments, doubling their stock of international bonds to US$2.8 trillion over the past five years. 15 And average annual portfolio flows to EMDEs have more than tripled from their average in the decade prior the crisis. 16 For the SDGs to be achieved, such flows must be larger, more reliable and better utilised. That�s why the FSB is now developing new policies to address liquidity, leverage and securities financing risks in asset management activities. These measures will help ensure asset managers can provide sustainable and reliable financing to EMDEs. That�s why the FSB is working to ensure the central counterparties that support the plumbing of the new system are resilient and can be resolved without disruption to the flow of financing to the real economy. And that�s why FSB members are working to develop more effective macro prudential policies. These will dampen the impact of capital flows on domestic vulnerabilities and allow countries to be more open and connected to global trade and investment. The FSB�s work plan is highly complementary to other G20 priorities in infrastructure, inclusiveness and climate change. A FAIR system is essential if we are to move to a 2 degree world. A FAIR system is critical to achieving the economic and moral imperatives of the SDGs. I look forward to our discussion of how to build such a system to the benefit of all.     15   BIS International Debt Statistics, (all sectors, nationality basis). 16   IMF World Economic Outlook data show that average annual portfolio flows to EMDEs have more than tripled      from their average in the decade prior to the crisis to an average of US$257 billion annually between 2009 and      2015.

2016-05-31	"Mark Carney: �20 note character selection announcement Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, Turner Contemporary Gallery, Margate, 22 April 2016.                                                        *   *   *  Though I�m surrounded by sublime art and architecture, typically for a Governor of the Bank of England, I want to begin by talking about money. Throughout history money has come in many forms � gold and silver coins; English �tally sticks� made of willow; even stone disks of up to twelve feet in diameter, pocket change on the Pacific island of Yap. It�s true; a Yap stone makes up part of the reserves of the Bank of Canada. Such variety has meant economists have struggled to define money. The Nobel Prize- winning economist, John Hicks, simply wrote �money is what money does.�1 Wisdom or sophistry? There�s a bit of Popeye or Forrest Gump in that.2 But what does money do? To some, banknotes are mere �barren tokens.�3 These meagre pieces of paper � soon to be polymer � of no intrinsic value, actually serve vital economic functions. They facilitate trade. They store value. They serve as a unit of account. As the soon-to-be replaced incumbent of our �20 note, Adam Smith, wrote, they are the �universal instrument of commerce.�4 Most fundamentally, Money is Memory.5 Money supplants the need to keep track of promises to exchange goods and services across time; it is a simple, universal replacement for detailed record keeping. Money is memory in another sense. It bridges time. The money we spend today could have been earned from past accomplishments or could be borrowed from future ones. Money is also Memory for a country and its people. Money, after all, can be a piece of art in everyone�s pocket. Far from being �barren�, our banknotes are a celebration of the UK�s heritage, a salute to its culture, a testament to the great achievements of its most notable individuals. In short, money has not just economic value; it has cultural value. By depicting characters on our banknotes, we celebrate those who have advanced British thought, spurred innovation, shown exceptional leadership, shaped this diverse society and forged our common values. The great statesman Sir Winston Churchill will feature on the next �5 note, unveiled on 2nd June, and issued in September, replacing the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry. The renowned author Jane Austen will feature on the �10 note, which will be issued in 2017, replacing the ground-breaking scientist Darwin.    1   Hicks, J R (1967), Critical Essays in Monetary Theory. 2   �I am what I am� or �Stupid is as Stupid Does�. 3   A moniker used by Kocherlakota. See Kocherlakota, N (1998), �Money is Memory�, Journal of Economic     Theory, 81 (2). 4   Book I, Chapter 4 �On the Origin and Use of Money� of Smith, A (1776), An Inquiry into the Nature and     Causes of the Wealth of Nations. 5   Kocherlakota (Ibid.)    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                          1 And I am delighted to announce that on the �20 note the great economist and moral philosopher, Adam Smith, will be replaced by Joseph Mallord William Turner.  Why Turner? Turner is arguably the single most influential British artist of all time. His work was transformative. His influence spanned his lifetime and endures today. He inspired the French impressionists and, as Ruskin said, was �the father of modern art.� His works include masterpieces such as Dutch Boats in a Gale, The Slave Ship, and Rain, Steam and Speed � The Great Western Railway. He captured the age of sail, of the advent of steam, the very atmospherics of the British Isles, and lines between light, movement and colour. And his influence endures. When Mark Rothko visited an exhibition on Turner at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, he jokingly said: �This man Turner, he learnt a lot from me.� The Margate gallery shows Turner�s continuing legacy, with a number of exhibitions influenced by Turner, including that of the Danish artist Joachim Koester � The Other Side of the Sky � which pairs his works with Turner watercolours. Turner�s story begins with humble origins. Born to a London barber and wig maker, his talent was unquestioned. He went to extremes in pursuit of the visceral artistic experience. Turner exhibited at the Royal Academy at 15, and became an Academician at 24. He was undeniably prolific, producing more than 550 oil paintings, 2,000 watercolours, and 30,000 sketches and drawings. His work will now feature on another 2 billion works of art � our new �20 notes.  How did we decide? How did we arrive at Turner? As befits Turner, we took the process of selecting a new banknote character out of the black box and brought it into the sunlight. In December 2013, the Bank of England committed to making our character selection process much more open and transparent. First, the Banknote Character Advisory Committee was created and then decided the field of accomplishment. They chose visual arts, which had never before been properly displayed on a banknote. The Bank then invited the public to make nominations in this field. They proposed artists, sculptors, printmakers, designers, craftspeople, ceramicists, architects, fashion designers, photographers and filmmakers. Indeed, the response was exceptional. We received almost 30,000 individual suggestions, between them nominating 590 different eligible characters � demonstrating not only the depth of achievement of British art but also the public�s passion for it. This pool was handed to our expert Banknote Advisory Committee � John Akomfrah, Sir David Cannadine, Andrew Graham-Dixon, Sandy Nairne, Alice Rawsthorn, Baroness Lola Young, and, from the Bank, Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent and Chief Cashier Victoria Cleland. They used their considerable knowledge, supplemented with views from public focus groups, and whittled down to a shortlist of five characters. What were the criteria?    2                                                                            BIS central bankers� speeches First, an unquestioned contribution to the visual arts. Second, a wider contribution to British society. And third, an enduring influence. The strength of the other four characters on the final shortlist � filmmaker Charlie Chaplin, sculptor Barbara Hepworth, painter William Hogarth, and designer Josiah Wedgwood � gives a sense of the exceptional pedigree of British visual arts � and contextualises Turner�s contribution. To develop this point, I�d like to now introduce a short film from the Committee members celebrating some of the nominated visual artists and outlining their views on the process that led to Turner being chosen.                                                        *** So as Darwin is about to be replaced on one of our notes and Churchill is to appear on another, it�s fitting that Turner should be unveiled on the next. And here is the new image for the new Turner banknote. It features Turner�s self-portrait, from 1799, currently on display in the Tate Britain; and one of his most eminent paintings � The Fighting Temeraire � which can be seen in the National Gallery. This painting was a tribute to the HMS Temeraire, which played a distinguished role in Nelson�s victory at Trafalgar in 1805. It also commemorates the Age of Steam replacing that of Wind as this great warship is pulled into harbour by small tug boat. And in classic Turner fashion captures the interplay between light and vibrant colour. The novelist William Makepeace Thackeray called it �as grand a painting as ever figured on the walls of any academy, or came from the easel of any painter.�6 In 2005, was voted Britain�s greatest painting in a BBC poll.7 The quote � �Light is therefore colour� � is from an 1818 lecture by Turner. It refers to his innovative use of light, shade, colour and tone � one example of his unquestioned contribution to the visual arts in Britain and beyond. Turner rarely signed his paintings, so the signature on the banknote was taken from his will. It is fitting because, in that document, he bequeathed his paintings to the nation � a wider contribution to British society. Most Turners are not locked away in private collections or spread to the four winds. They are free for the British public to see across some of our greatest museums. And finally, Turner�s legacy endures. From his influence on art for more than two centuries, to the prize that bears his name and celebrates British contemporary art � indeed, to this magnificent gallery, the Turner Contemporary. It is fitting we are here in Margate, where Turner visited frequently throughout his life. This gallery stands on the original site of Mrs Booth�s seafront guest house, where Turner stayed whenever he visited.8 More than 100 of his works were inspired by the East Kent coast, and he held that �the skies over Thanet are the loveliest in all Europe.�                                                        ***    6   P.

Not a distant memory but a living one. The past sedimented in the present. An influence which endures. It�s even more fitting that we can celebrate Turner�s continuing influence by having one of our most eminent artists, someone whom Turner has influenced and one of Margate�s own, once Enfant Terrible, today Royal Academician, and master of confessional art, Tracey Emin, to share her thoughts with us now.     4                                                                          BIS central bankers� speeches"
2016-06-07	"Mark Carney: The New Fiver Opening remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the �5 note launch, Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, 2 June 2016.                                             *    *    *  I would like to express my gratitude to his grace, the Duke of Marlborough, for his generosity in hosting this historic event at one of the nation�s greatest architectural treasures. On September 3rd 1939, with The Gathering Storm about to break, a new First Lord of the Admiralty was appointed. He was so familiar to the Navy that the signal to the Fleet said simply: �Winston is Back.� In the years that followed, Britain�s resolve, tenacity and spirit would all be tested. The nation proved more than equal to the task. Britain stood steadfast through its Finest Hour. In North Africa, Asia and the Balkans, the United Kingdom helped turn the Hinge of Fate. It would forge The Grand Alliance to liberate Europe from tyranny, and then with victory, set the vision for the reconstruction of the post- war era. The �bulldog spirit� of those years was embodied and emboldened by Winston Churchill. This spirit is just one of his many contributions that the Bank commemorates with The New Fiver. Churchill was not just a martial leader � though he was an exceptional one � he was also one of the greatest statesmen of all time.  Blenheim Great statesmen know their history, and Churchill knew more than most. Indeed, the author of the Life and Times of Marlborough would likely have approved of this choice of venue for today�s launch. After all, Blenheim Palace was built as a gift to the first Duke of Marlborough, John Churchill, in recognition for his leadership of the Allied forces to victory in the Battle of Blenheim in 1704 � a victory that would decisively turn the War of Spanish Succession. Winston Churchill was born here in 1874 and proposed to his wife, Clementine Hozier, on these grounds in 1908.  Banknote character Winston Churchill will replace Elizabeth Fry, the prison reformer, on the Fiver from September of this year. The new �5 note will in due course sit alongside the new �10, which will feature Jane Austen, the new �20, which celebrates JMW Turner, and the existing �50 which profiles Boulton and Watt. Individuals who symbolise the breadth and depth of British achievement across statecraft, social reform, literature, visual arts, science and commerce. This demonstrates that our banknotes do not just have economic value � the classic roles of money to facilitate trade, store value, and provide a unit of account. Banknotes have cultural value as well. By depicting characters on our banknotes, we celebrate those who have advanced British thought, spurred innovation, shown exceptional leadership, shaped this diverse society and forged its common values. In these regards, money is memory for a country and its people.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                   1 I have already alluded to why Churchill is a worthy choice. Were that in doubt, consider that, in 2002, Churchill was voted �the greatest ever Briton� in a BBC poll. Or that he continues to command vast international recognition as a hero of the free world. Churchill�s contributions extended beyond his pivotal roles in the nation�s martial and political histories. He is the only British Prime Minister to have won the Nobel Prize in literature. He was a prodigious painter, and, perhaps thankfully, the only Prime Minister to enter the music charts. The wisdom of his witticisms is legion, extending as far as the dismal science. Central bank forecasters can identify closely with his advice that, �it is a much better policy to prophesy after the event has already taken place.�  Polymer But in some prophesies we can be confident: for example that our new polymer banknotes, of which The New Fiver is the first, will stand the test of time. Polymer marks a major innovation. It is cleaner, safer, and stronger. It is resistant to dirt and moisture, so the note won�t wear out as quickly as the current fivers but will stay in good condition for longer. It is stronger than paper and can better withstand being repeatedly folded into wallets or scrunched up inside pockets. Polymer notes can survive a splash of Claret, a flick of cigar ash, the nip of a bulldog, and even a spin in the washing machine afterwards to boot. This added strength means we expect polymer notes to last at least two-and-a-half times longer than the current generation of �5 banknotes, generating cost savings over time. Polymer notes are also better for the environment. Because they will last longer, we will have to print fewer. That means less energy in production and transportation. And when a polymer banknote has reached the end of its useful life, it will be recycled. Importantly, using polymer means we can incorporate better security features. It allows for see-through panels, coloured foils, detailed metallic images, and a new advance: tactile features. In fact, I can announce today that tactile features will be present on all the other denomination polymer notes, leaving The New Fiver identifiable by their absence. This all means safer banknotes, with the tactile feature helping the visually impaired to recognise our different notes, ensuring the nation�s money is as inclusive as possible. By adopting polymer, we�re aligning with international best practice, alongside Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. As Churchill did, we may have to wait a while for the Americans to join up. We have exploited polymer�s possibilities in The New Fiver�s design. It features Churchill�s portrait, captured in Ottawa by Yousuf Karsh. The famous glower of the war-time hero prompted, in this case, by the photographer�s decision to take Churchill�s cigar away from him. 1 Behind the portrait is an illustration of the Houses of Parliament by Abigail Daker, viewed from the South Bank, looking across Westminster Bridge. The hands on the Great Clock on Big Ben are set to the time on 13 May 1940 when Churchill made his inaugural speech to the House of Commons as Prime Minister.   1   Karsh described taking the photograph thus: �I stepped toward him and without premeditation, but ever so     respectfully, I said, �Forgive me, Sir� and plucked the cigar out of his mouth. By the time I got back to my     camera, he looked so belligerent he could have devoured me. It was at that instant I took the photograph. The     silence was deafening. Then Mr Churchill, smiling benignly, said, �You may take another one.� He walked     toward me, shook my hand and said, �You can even make a roaring lion stand still to be photographed.��    2                                                                                        BIS central bankers� speeches His declaration then � �I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat� � is quoted beneath the portrait. Let�s take a look at some of these features with a video.  Conclusion �A gigantic historical figure during his own lifetime, superhumanly bold, strong, and imaginative, one of the two greatest men of action his nation has produced, an orator of prodigious powers, the saviour of his country, a legendary hero who belongs to myth as much as to reality, the largest human being of our time.� This was the judgment of his contemporary, the philosopher and historian Isaiah Berlin. Churchill himself said that �a nation that forgets its past has no future.� Our banknotes are testaments to the outstanding achievements of the nation�s greatest individuals; they are repositories of the United Kingdom�s collective memory. That contribution will continue with the new �5, which brings together the future, in the form of polymer and the most advanced security features yet, and Britain�s glorious history, in the achievements of Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill.

2016-06-21	"Mark Carney: Enabling the FinTech transformation � revolution, restoration, or reformation? Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Lord Mayor�s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London, Mansion House, London, 16 June 2016.                                                 *    *   *  Given the tragic murder of Jo Cox MP on 16 June, at the Mansion House dinner in lieu of this speech, the Governor paid tribute to Ms Cox and the highest standards of public service she represented throughout her life.  1.          Introduction My Lord Mayor, Chancellor, My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen. Let me begin by thanking Andrew Bailey for his outstanding record of public service during his 31 years at the Bank of England. Andrew is an extraordinary public servant who has devoted his entire professional life to serving the people of the United Kingdom. During his career, he has worked across all of the Bank�s policy areas, combining leadership and innovation to deliver consistently the Bank�s policy objectives. His work in helping to manage the crisis and then to develop the post-crisis regulatory framework has been exemplary. He has made the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) a highly respected and effective regulator and built a team of exceptionally dedicated colleagues. I would like to thank Andrew for his counsel and support since I joined the Bank and wish him every success in steering the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) at this vital time in its history. I admire his commitment to ensuring the UK�s financial system serves its real economy and I look forward to continuing to work closely with him in future. Although the Bank has placed itself in purdah, its duties never cease. The people of the United Kingdom, via parliament, have conferred tremendous responsibilities on the Bank. These remits must be pursued continuously, independently and transparently. The independence of the Bank of England is at the heart of the integrity of the financial system. And the Bank�s independent conduct of monetary policy is vital to ensuring price stability and to support strong, sustainable and balanced growth across the United Kingdom. Transparency is the hallmark of modern central banking and democratic accountability. Today, consistent with its statutory responsibilities, the nine-member independent Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) announced its latest monetary policy decision. The published minutes of that meeting contain, as they should, carefully calibrated and precisely worded descriptions of the MPC�s deliberations, the adjustments to our outlook, including our assessment of the major risks to the economy. The minutes also note some of the wide range of contingency plans the Bank has put in place to support market functioning and financial stability around the referendum. If you have not already done so, I recommend you read them. Let me move from the short term to the medium term. For there is more than a whiff of revolution in the air.  2.          The promise of FinTech                  Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive; but to be young was very heaven!     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                  1 To its advocates, the wave of innovation sweeping through the world of financial technology promises nothing short of revolution. �FinTech� heralds the dawn of narrow banking and portfolio optimisation. It will change the nature of money, 1 shake the foundations of central banking and deliver nothing less than a democratic revolution for all who use financial services. Revolutions are not always abrupt, and sometimes their origins remain obscure. In noting the possibilities at the start of the Twentieth century, Keynes remarked that �the inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed � the various products of the whole earth � adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world�; [or] decide to couple the security of his fortunes with the good faith of the townspeople of any substantial municipality in any continent that fancy or information might recommend�� Such global portfolio management was made possible by technological developments stretching back decades, ranging from the �pantelegraph� of the 1860s � capable of transmitting signatures to verify bank deposits � to the cable buried deep beneath the Atlantic that could transmit eight words a minute. Such remote trade confirmation and low latency that made the Flash Boys of the day possible. The financial globalisation these innovations enabled was built on a much earlier, simpler, and more profoundly transformational development: the ledger. For there is no finance without the ability to record transactions, balances, and obligations. Money and credit, the universal instruments of commerce, could not exist without this most fundamental of financial technologies, which allows debits and credits to be netted off; debt to circulate as currency; money to replace memory; and with it, trade to expand exponentially. How much have we progressed since Keynes� bed-ridden globalisation? Replace �telephone� with a �tablet� and �tea� with a �soy latteccino� and you have not the start of the Twentieth Century but the Twenty First, a century in which opportunities are no longer limited to men or denizens of the City. Nonetheless, finance continues to be arranged around a series of hubs like brokers, clearing houses and exchanges; whereas, in other domains, people form connections directly, instantaneously and openly, and this is revolutionising how they consume, work, and communicate. The extent to which finance continues democratising and transforming depends on superficially arcane, but fundamentally vital, enabling technologies. The emergence of mobile telephony, the ubiquity of the internet, availability of high-speed computing, advances in cryptography, and innovations in machine learning could combine to enable rapid changes in finance � just as they have in other areas of the economy. The ledger, once stone, wood, or paper � and always centralised � is now digital and may become distributed. FinTech has the potential to deliver more resilient financial infrastructure, more effective trade and settlement, and new ways to encode, share and analyse data. For the financial sector, these could offer shorter, speedier transaction chains; greater capital efficiency; and stronger operational resilience. For consumers, they could mean more choice; better-targeted services; and keener pricing. For everyone, FinTech may deliver a more inclusive financial system, domestically and globally; with people better connected, more informed and increasingly empowered. 2    1   Especially the balance between inside money (created by commercial banks) and outside money (created by     central banks). 2   FinTech could play a role in helping to address a worrying decline in the provision of correspondent banking     services which support cross-border payment and settlement. Half of emerging market and developing economy     jurisdictions, three quarters of large banks and a majority of local and regional respondent banks recently     reported a decline in such services. Know-your-customer utilities and potentially distributed ledger technologies   2                                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches These benefits spring from FinTech�s potential to deliver a great unbundling of banking into its core functions of settling payments, performing maturity transformation, sharing risk and allocating capital. This would mean revolution, fundamentally re-shaping the financial system. At the same time, some financial technologies could make incumbent banks more efficient and profitable, reinforcing existing economies of scale and scope in banking. This would mean a restoration, reinforcing incumbents� power. The balance of these forces may yield a third alternative � a reformation � a more diverse, resilient and effective system for consumers. One where large banks exist alongside new entrants who compete across the value chain. Tonight, I want to discuss how FinTech could affect the Bank of England�s policy objectives and our role in enabling FinTech to meet its promise for the people we serve. I will begin with the former.  3.          The Potential impact of FinTech on financial and monetary stability FinTech has the potential to affect monetary policy transmission, the safety and soundness of the firms we supervise, the resilience of the financial system, and the nature of shocks that it might face. It could also have profound implications for the Bank�s secondary objective, as supervisors, to facilitate effective competition between the firms we regulate. The impact on firms� safety and soundness depends on several factors. By making wholesale and retail settlement faster and capital allocation more efficient, FinTech could boost banks� returns and therefore viability. Already, FinTech is spurring new entrants including payments providers, peer-to-peer lenders, robo advisors, innovative trading platforms, and foreign exchange agents. This could, with time, unbundle traditional banking models and deny banks their traditional economies of scale and scope. The systemic consequences of FinTech are even more complex. More diverse business models and alternative providers are positives for financial stability. By allowing better credit screening and less adverse selection, FinTech could improve risk assessment, credit allocation, and capital efficiency. But if it encourages herding on common information, trading positions could become more correlated. And if switching costs in funding markets fall, liquidity risk could rise and systemic risks grow. Indeed, sometimes when I hear of democratising finance, spreading risk in capital-light originate-to-distribute models, I think I haven�t been this excited since the advent of sub-prime. FinTech could also affect the conduct of monetary policy. Unbundled banking would change the roles of bank capital and funding costs in the credit channel of monetary policy. If FinTech enhances participation in financial markets, the wealth channel of monetary policy could strengthen. More broadly, Big Data techniques could tell us about the state of the economy more accurately and promptly. Forecast performance could improve, akin to the forecast improvements that better measurement of atmospheric conditions has, over time, delivered for meteorologists.          may help to lower the compliance costs which major banks say have been a factor in their decisions to withdraw      from correspondent banking. And in time, FinTech may broaden the pool of non-banks able to provide      individuals and companies with viable alternatives, but for now banks continue to act as gatekeepers to payment      and settlement in central bank money.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                     3 My own forecast is that FinTech�s consequences for the Bank�s objectives will not become fully apparent for some time. Many of the technologies needed to deliver such transformations are nascent � their scalability and compatibility untested beyond Proofs of Concept. Moreover, the bar for displacing incumbent technologies is very high. Nor will the Bank of England take risks with the resilience of the core of the system. Disruption won�t come either easy or cheap.  4.          Enabling the FinTech Transformation We are actively exploring how new financial technologies could support our policy objectives. There are five ways the Bank is enabling the FinTech transformation. The first is widening access to central bank money to non-bank Payments Service Providers, known as PSPs. 3  As the internet revolutionised commerce, making trade faster and markets more competitive, payments technology lagged in many countries, although it is worth remembering that the UK has been a global leader on real-time retail payments. Faster Payments (FPS) was one of the earliest real-time retail systems introduced, in 2008. Now, new entrants and established players are seeking to provide payment services that are instantaneous, secure, reliable and accessible anytime from anywhere. 4 Retail consumers and firms are increasingly demanding payments completed in seconds, not hours or days. They expect payments to be seamless, reliable and cheap whether to recipients overseas or just up the street. And they expect to make payments without visits to a bank branch or even logging onto a desktop computer. Similarly, companies, financial intermediaries and governments want to process ever larger and more complex bulk payments covering multiple systems, countries and currencies. Central banks lie at the hearts of payment systems, giving households and firms the assurance that transactions have settled in the most secure form of payment: central bank money. To fulfil that role, our payments infrastructure needs to remain fit for purpose: reliable, resilient and robust. But we must also be responsive to changing payments demands. So earlier this year the Bank announced we would be drawing up a blueprint to replace our current real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system, now twenty years old. 48 institutions currently have settlement accounts in RTGS. All other users of the systems that settle across RTGS access settlement via one of four agent banks. 5 These users include over 1000 non-bank PSPs serving customers� increasingly demanding standards, and many rely on major UK payment schemes, particularly Faster Payments (FPS). As they grow, some PSPs want to reduce their reliance on the systems, service levels, risk appetite and goodwill of the very banks with whom they are competing. Re-selling services ultimately provided by banks limits these firms� growth, potential to innovate, and competitive impact.     3    These PSPs include firms granted the status of either an e-money or payment institution in the UK. 4    Examples include From Stripe to Square, from Paypal to Ripple, from Applepay to Zapp. 5    Indirect access removes the need to build costly payments infrastructure � a potentially large fixed cost for      young companies.    4                                                                                          BIS central bankers� speeches That is why I am announcing this evening that the Bank intends to extend direct access to RTGS beyond the current set of firms, allowing a range of non-bank PSPs to compete on a level playing field with banks. 6 By increasing the proportion of settlement in central bank money, diversifying the number of settlement firms, and driving greater innovation in risk-reducing payments technologies, expanding access should bring financial stability benefits. It should also enable more efficient, effective and inclusive payments, including in ways that we cannot fully anticipate. It is not a one-way street, however. As we extend access, we will safeguard resilience in three ways: by holding settlement account holders to the appropriate standards; by removing legislative barriers to non-bank access; and by designing the right account arrangements for new entrants. I am pleased that both the FCA and HMRC, who together supervise these institutions, are committed to developing a strengthened supervisory regime for those who apply for an RTGS settlement account, to give assurance that non-bank PSPs can safely take their place at the heart of the payment system. And I welcome the Chancellor�s commitment tonight to make the necessary legislative changes to ensure that these new entrants can access RTGS safely and efficiently. 7 By extending RTGS access, our objective is to increase competition and innovation in the market for payment services. To ensure that PSPs are not disadvantaged relative to banks offering equivalent payment services, the Bank intends to give appropriate remuneration for balances that PSPs will be required to hold overnight to support their payments activities. 8 The second way the Bank is enabling the FinTech transformation is by being open to providing access to central bank money for new forms of wholesale securities settlement. Securities settlement is the lifeblood of modern wholesale financial markets � the associated payments account for fully half of RTGS�s daily settlement flows. However, as with retail payments, securities settlement is now ripe for innovation. A typical settlement chain can involve many different intermediaries, meaning securities settlement is comparatively slow. Transactions that take nanoseconds to execute settle in days. This also means large costs and operational risk. And, like in payment systems, economies of scale introduce concentration and create single points of failure. All of that ties up potentially tens of   6   Another key enabler of PSP access to major retail payment systems such as FPS is the development of     aggregators that can provide direct technical connections to the infrastructure, reducing the costs of building     this capability for newer entrants. The intention is that these aggregators could be used by PSPs without an     RTGS account, but under this arrangement PSPs would still need an agent bank for settlement of their     obligations across RTGS. 7   The legislative changes include adding Payment Institutions to the list of regulated entities to whom the     Settlement Finality Regulations apply, modifying the Payment Services and Electronic Money Regulations to     enable safeguarded funds held by E-Money Institutions and Payment Institutions to be posted with the Bank     and amending the Banking Act to expand HM Treasury�s powers to grant the     Bank of England with the ability to supervise any relevant payments systems if they ultimately grow large enough     to pose a systemic threat. The first is essential to enable these firms to benefit from the critical protections the     Settlement Finality Regulations offer to users of major UK payment systems. The second is needed to enable     these firms to deposit monies in RTGS on behalf of their customers. The final change provides assurance that     any longer-term stability implications of these changes can be addressed under the Bank�s prudential remit. 8   We do not intend, however, to extend facilities to PSPs for which they have no need. Non-bank PSPs will not     therefore be eligible for membership of the Sterling Monetary Framework � and in particular the Bank�s credit     facilities. That is because PSPs are not part of the monetary policy transmission mechanism or exposed to     inherent overnight liquidity risk. The Bank may also take steps to limit PSPs� capacity to hold unlimited overnight     balances on their settlement accounts.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                         5 billions of pounds worth of capital. With the economics of wholesale banking under pressure, cutting inefficiencies is a high priority for industry. That is why it is welcome that FinTech innovators are exploring the potential of distributed ledger technology to simplify the settlement chain, reduce its cost, and raise its speed while increasing resilience. The instruments involved range from equities to bank loans. However, the challenges facing such projects are legion, including reliability, resilience, security and scale. And fundamentally, how to prove technologies that are still nascent? One challenge an otherwise robust system of sufficient scale would not face is access to central bank money from the Bank of England. The Bank has for many years sought to ensure that, wherever possible, wholesale securities settlement occurs in central bank money. We are already clear that we stand ready to act as settlement agent both for regulated systemically important schemes supervised by the Bank, and, on a case-by-case basis, for other new systems. 9 The Bank will use this to enable innovation and competition, without compromising stability. The third way the Bank is enabling the FinTech transformation is by exploring the use of Distributed Ledger (DL) technology in our core activities, including the operation of RTGS. If distributed ledger technology could provide a more efficient way for private sector firms to deliver payments and settle securities, why not apply it to the core of the payments system itself? The great promise of distributed ledgers for central banks is their potential to enhance resilience. Distributing the ledger means multiple copies of the system. It can continue to operate if parts get knocked out. That removes the single point of failure risk inherent in a centralised system. But if we are to entrust the heart of our financial system to such technology, it must be robust and reliable. The payments system we oversee processes �� trillion of bank transactions, equivalent to around 1/3 of annual GDP, each day. Disruptions are potentially costly. That is why, in payments and settlement, the Bank has an extremely low tolerance for any threat to the integrity of the economy�s �plumbing�. We won�t beta test RTGS. To help distinguish DL�s potential from its hype, the Bank has set up our own as a Proof of Concept. We have learned a great deal � about the opportunities and the challenges that need to be met before DL could be used in central banking. Some of those challenges are familiar to any payments system. 10 Others are more specific to DL. For example, we would need assurance that DL systems can be scaled, retain data integrity, and operate at the speeds and volumes required by central bank infrastructure � day in, day out. And we need to be certain that the privacy of the data in those distributed copies cannot be compromised by cyber attack, not just today but in the future. One way this might be achieved is to limit the distribution of the ledger to existing trusted parties, such as other public sector entities. To move forward we are working with other central banks. Beyond this we are open to working with others to explore further possibilities, including alternative applications of the technology.    9    The criteria are publicly available in the Bank�s Settlement Account Policy, available                          at:      http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/Documents/paymentsystems/boesettlementaccounts.pdf. 10   In particular, participants need to be identifiable; permissions need to be assigned; messaging must be secure;      and transactions must be verified, recorded, and stored. Ownership of assets must be capable of being      determined with certainty, particularly in the event of a participant default.    6                                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches In the extreme, a DL for everyone could open the possibility of creating a central bank digital currency. On some levels this is appealing. For example it would mean people have direct access to the ultimate risk-free asset. In its extreme form, it could fundamentally and perhaps abruptly re-shape banking. However, were it to co-exist with the current banking model, it could exacerbate liquidity risk by lowering the frictions involved in running to central bank money. 11 These questions and others are why these topics are being examined as part of the Bank�s research agenda, with the prospect of a central bank digital currency for the UK, in my view, still some way off. We will work to make payments easier, and though cash may no longer be king it once was, its reign will endure for some time. The fourth way the Bank is enabling the FinTech transformation is by partnering with FinTech companies on projects of direct relevance to the Bank�s mission. I am announcing tonight that the Bank is launching a FinTech Accelerator to work in partnership with FinTech firms on challenges that we, as a central bank, uniquely face. The Accelerator will work with new technology firms to help us harness FinTech innovations for central banking. In return, it will offer firms the chance to demonstrate their solutions for real issues facing us as policymakers, together with the valuable �first client� reference that comes with it. With time, the Accelerator will build a network of firms working in this space for the benefit of us and them alike. How will this help us? Consider that the Bank monitors risks that threaten the operational resilience of the UK financial system. At the Financial Policy Committee�s instigation, we have been working with other authorities to encourage firms to improve their cyber defences. Over the past two years, twenty-three firms have undergone CBEST penetration tests, with all core banks expected to have completed tests by the end of this year. To complement these efforts, the Bank has begun examining how public data could be used to assess firms� cyber resilience, including looking for malware on a firm�s systems, software vulnerabilities, or weak encryption that could be exploited by hackers. 12 As a proof of concept and good cyber hygiene, we are using data publically available on the web to assess our own resilience. Early results indicate these techniques could complement existing tests in our regular assessments of firms� operational resilience. We are also exploring how we - and others - could use the data the Bank collects more effectively. Big Data has the potential to help the Bank�s policy committees identify trends in systemic risk and the economy. Much of the data we collect is rightly subject to strict limits on confidentiality and sharing. For example, our regulatory mortgage contract data comes under strict control to guarantee personal data protection. We can�t just share the private data to which we have access with external researchers, foreign authorities or even across the Bank. But this means that, simply put, the people of the United Kingdom are not getting the most out of the data the Bank collects.     11   For further discussion see Broadbent (2016), �Central banks and digital currencies�, available at:      http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2016/886.aspx. 12   This allows an efficient check of a firm�s cyber defences akin to the way a policeman could walk by a house and      observe, from the outside, its security features � whether the gate is locked; whether it has an alarm; whether      windows have been left open; what routes intruders might use to gain access to the property; and so on.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                     7 That�s why we are investigating ways of anonymising and de-sensitising data � fully respecting privacy laws without losing analytical content � to allow wider sharing. Progress has been encouraging creating the prospect of better informed policy making. 13 These are just two examples of a bigger programme of collaboration between the Bank and technology innovators. We are open to further collaboration and tomorrow will provide details of the next steps. Finally, the Bank is calibrating its regulatory approach to FinTech developments. FinTech should neither be the Wild West nor strangled at birth. The Bank is devoting considerable resources to ensure whatever develops is sustainable, not ephemeral. If FinTech enables a great unbundling of financial services, risks will change in tandem. Our interest is in ensuring the safety and soundness of banks, the protection of insurance policy holders and the resilience of financial ecosystem as a whole to these changing risks. It is about activities not labels. That is why the Bank has been engaging with FinTech firms to understand better the financial stability risks that could emerge as banking is re-shaped. We will monitor those that arise along the transition path and those that could endure. Where firms or activities become systemic and risks to the real economy grow, they will come within the purview of the Bank�s responsibilities for the stability of the system as a whole. The Financial Policy Committee will continue to monitor the scope of the regulatory perimeter. Adjustments will follow if necessary. When FinTech companies fall within our remits, we will monitor them in the same proportionate way that we approach other firms � backed by analytics and judgement, taking action where appropriate. We are building a system that allows for orderly failures. Not just to end the blatant unfairness of Too Big to Fail, but also to foster industry dynamism and better outcomes for consumers. After all, ease of exit promotes ease of entry. We won�t discourage avatars by preserving dinosaurs.  5.          Conclusion Will FinTech mean a restoration, reformation, or revolution for finance? Through our regulatory approach, widening access to RTGS, and facilitating technological development, the Bank is helping to enable a sustainable FinTech reformation. This will promote the UK�s monetary and financial stability and mean better financial services for firms and households. With time, FinTech could mean a more open, more transparent, and more democratic global financial system. As host to the world�s greatest financial centre, this room, this City, this country stand to gain tremendously. The Bank will play its role in enabling a blissful dawn to unfold; to set the budding rose above the rose full blown.     13   More broadly, Sir Charlie Bean�s independent review of economic statistics highlighted the impact on economic      data arising from inadequate sharing of data across the public sector, something that I am pleased that the      Cabinet Office is taking steps to address.    8                                                                                         BIS central bankers� speeches"
2016-07-04	"Mark Carney: Uncertainty, the economy and policy Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the Bank of England, London, 30 June 2016.                                                      *     *    *  Today I want to discuss what uncertainty means for the UK�s economic performance, and how the Bank of England can best respond to it. The result of the referendum is clear. Its full implications for the economy are not. The UK can handle change. It has one of the most flexible economies in the world and benefits from a deep reservoir of human capital, world-class infrastructure and the rule of law. Its people are admired the world over for their strength under adversity. The question is not whether the UK will adjust but rather how quickly and how well. Nonetheless, the decision to leave the European Union marks a major regime shift. In the coming years, the UK will redefine its openness to the movement of goods, services, people and capital. In tandem, a potentially broad range of regulations might change. Uncertainty over the pace, breadth and scale of these changes could weigh on our economic prospects for some time. While some of the necessary adjustments may prove difficult and many will take time, the transition from the initial shock to the restructuring and then building of the UK economy will be much easier because of our solid policy frameworks. At times of great uncertainty, households, businesses and investors ask basic economic questions. Will inflation remain under control? Will the financial system do its job? Will I keep mine? Such issues are why monetary and financial stability are fundamental pre-requisites for effective economic adjustment and sustained prosperity. Discharging the Bank�s responsibilities for these public goods demands rigorous analysis, objective judgement, and effective transparency. We will not shirk from these obligations. The Bank and its independent policy committees will continue to provide analytically based, clear-eyed assessments of the economic and financial outlooks. And we will outline the risks to these forecasts so that we and others can prepare to manage them. The near-term challenges facing the UK economy can�t be wished away. But they can be addressed. A clear plan is needed, and its measures must be implemented with resolute determination. After briefly reviewing the relationship between uncertainty and the economy, I want to review how the Bank of England�s contribution to that plan will unfold over the coming weeks. But at the outset, I want to re-emphasise that the Bank has taken all the necessary steps to prepare for these events. And we will not hesitate to take any additional measures required to meet our responsibilities as the United Kingdom moves forward.  1.          Bad things come in threes: geopolitical, economic, and policy uncertainty Before expanding on what the Bank can do, I would like to apply some rigour to the relationship between uncertainty and economic performance.1    1    Formally, �risk� and �uncertainty� are distinct � one being quantifiable with probabilities, either physical or      subjective, and the other not. Economic theorists have discussed and modelled this distinction at least since      Knight (1921). The empirical literature in macroeconomics tends, however, to elide this distinction somewhat,      attempting formally to measure �uncertainty� by constructing indices mentioned in the text that probably also      capture some elements of �risk�. Knight, F (1921), Risk, uncertainty, and profit, Boston.   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                     1 Science, including social science, begins with measurement. Although imperfect, there are at least three distinct types of uncertainty that influence economic performance.2 The first is geopolitical uncertainty. It doubled after 9/11 and remained elevated and volatile for years afterwards (Chart 1).3 After settling in the wake of the global financial crisis, geopolitical risk spiked with the passing of the Arab Spring and the rise of tensions in Eastern Europe. The second class of uncertainty � economic � is probably the most familiar. In recent years, economic uncertainty has been elevated because of fragilities in the financial system and overhangs of public and private debt. These challenges have been compounded by deeper forces that have radically altered the balance of saving and investment in the global economy.4 In the process, these have moved equilibrium interest rates into regions that monetary policy finds difficult to reach. Whether called �secular stagnation� or a �global liquidity trap�, the drag on jobs, wages and growth is real.                                                       Chart 1                           Geopolitical risk doubled, on average, after 9/11     Source: Bank calculations and Caldara and Iacoviello (2016), ibid.  Less visible, but more fundamental drivers of economic uncertainty are the powerful forces arising from technology and globalisation. The integration of 40% of humanity into the global economy has re-orientated production, eliminated jobs and may have depressed wages. These dynamics have been accompanied by the implications of technology for the   2   These are distinct from other types of uncertainty familiar to economists, including model uncertainty     (uncertainty about the empirical properties of models as descriptions of the world), or to policymakers, such as     the long and variable lags involved in the effects of monetary policy. 3   Economists have recently attempted its measurement by examining the frequency of newspaper articles     containing terms like �geopolitical tensions�, �terrorist threats�, and �war risks� in a sample of global     newspapers. See Caldara, D and Iacoviello, M (2016), �Measuring geopolitical risk�, Federal Reserve Board,     mimeo. Political scientists have also constructed similar measures though, it seems, at lower frequency. For     an application see for example Berkman, H., B. Jacobsen, and J. B. Lee (2011), �Time-varying rare disaster     risk and stock returns�, Journal of Financial Economics 101 (2). 4   These include demographics, inequality, lower public investment, saving in emerging markets, higher credit     spreads, cheaper capital goods, and lower trend growth. See Rachel, L and Smith, T (2015), �Secular drivers     of the global real interest rate�, Bank of England Staff Working Paper.  2                                                                                           BIS central bankers� speeches automation of jobs and of trade for their location; and the consequences of bigger, more global markets for �winner takes all� patterns of compensation. These secular trends can be reinforced by more cyclical moves (Chart 2).5 Cyclical economic uncertainty spiked during the crisis, remained very subdued until last autumn, and has since been on the rise. The last of the uncertainty trinity is policy uncertainty.6 It is reduced when there are clear policy remits, frameworks, and institutional structures that empower and discipline fiscal, monetary and regulatory authorities. It is elevated when these are absent. And it is influenced by the effectiveness of the tools available to central banks, the clarity of their policy strategies and, crucially, the transparency of their communications.                                                       Chart 2               UK economic uncertainty spiked after the failure of Lehman Brothers     Source: Bank calculations and Haddow et al (ibid.). Shows data to end-May.   In recent years, policy uncertainty has increased globally. In some jurisdictions, fiscal frameworks have been questioned; in others, exchange rate regimes. And with very low interest rates and expanding unconventional policies, the efficacy of monetary policy itself has been questioned. The charge that central banks are out of monetary ammunition is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed. Indices of policy uncertainty are about 1� times their pre-crisis averages in the US and Japan, and as high as three times in China. In the UK, progress since the financial crisis has been more than totally unwound this year with the measure having risen to five times its pre- crisis average by the start of the official referendum campaign (Chart 3).   5   A closely watched measure of economic uncertainty � the VIX � spiked when the global financial crisis hit.     Measures that combine this with other sources of economic uncertainty, such as dispersion among     forecasters� growth projections, households� unemployment expectations, and currency volatility, show clear     variation over time, and rise at times of economic stress. See Haddow, A, Hare, C, Hooley, J and Shakir, T     (2013) �Macroeconomic uncertainty: what is it, how can we measure it and why does it matter?�, Bank of     England Quarterly Bulletin, Q2. 6   One way some of this has been measured is again to count occurrences in media articles of references to     economics, uncertainty, and policy terms like �deficit�, �regulation� or terms relating to monetary policy. See:     Baker, S, Bloom, N and Davis, S (2015), �Measuring economic policy uncertainty�, NBER Working Paper No.     21633, October.   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                     3 While clearly these three uncertainty measures are related, distinct movements are visible. The heady days of the Great Moderation were restrained by geopolitical uncertainty. During the financial and euro crises, by contrast, economic uncertainty dominated. And from 2012 onwards, with the abatement of the acute phase of the euro-area crisis, economic uncertainty began to fall back, only to be replaced by renewed geopolitical tensions and now sharply higher policy uncertainty (Chart 4).                                                       Chart 3                UK economic policy uncertainty has increased since the global                      financial crisis, rising sharply higher in early 2016     Source: Bank calculations and Baker et al, (2015), ibid.

What do the combined effects of uncertainty mean? All this uncertainty has contributed to a form of economic post-traumatic stress disorder amongst households and businesses, as well as in financial markets � that is, a heightened sensitivity to downside tail risks, a growing caution about the future, and an aversion to assets or irreversible decisions that may be exposed to future �disaster risk�.7 There may be an affect heuristic at work. Put simply, long after the original trigger becomes remote, perceptions endure. They become embedded in economic narratives and their salience persistently affects risk perceptions and economic behaviour. This point is not trivial. Research has shown that people who have experienced low returns throughout their lives, like the �Depression Babies� of the 1930s, report lower willingness to take financial risk, are less likely to participate in the stock market, invest a lower fraction of their assets in equities, and are more pessimistic about future returns.8 Today, uncertainty has meant an inchoate sense of economic insecurity for many people despite generalised economic prosperity. Across the advanced economies, employment appears less secure, wages more subdued, and inequality more pronounced. And its precautionary effects can mean spending is deferred because there is often a real option value to waiting.9 Firms delay investment decisions. Investors seek safe returns. Households put off buying durables. The common thread is that any economic decision that requires finance, has a sunk cost, or an uncertain payoff, is affected. While the effect on output is clearly negative, the effect on inflation is ambiguous. Uncertainty�s stultifying effects weigh on employment and aggregate demand, creating disinflationary pressures, while the freeze in resource reallocation can hold back productivity and aggregate supply, creating inflationary pressures.10 11 Higher uncertainty can also mean investment responds more sluggishly to demand stimulus.12     7    See Broadbent (2014) for a further discussion of disaster risk and what it means for safe rates.

Charts show different vintages of earnings per share (EPS) forecasts for major     equity indices, by year.    We have seen the consequences of these effects in financial markets for some time. How are these dynamics manifest today? First, there has been serial disappointment in corporate earnings (Chart 6). The failure of past relationships to reassert, especially rates of productivity growth, has embedded a growing sense of uncertainty in markets about the fundamentals upon which future prosperity will be built.     6                                                                                               BIS central bankers� speeches Second, the equity risk premium has risen sharply (Charts 7 and 8).

The serial disappointment in earnings growth is mirrored in global growth since the crisis (Chart 9). In advanced economies, uncertainty appears to be holding back spending, particularly by corporates. Globally, investment remains weak (Charts 10 and 11). In the UK, relatively strong business investment growth in the past few years has only restored it to a level still shy of its pre-crisis share of GDP (Chart 12), and it is tracking below past cycles (Chart 13).     13   A fall in expected growth rates will tend to push down on expected future earnings, lowering equity prices and      increasing the equity yield. At the same time, a fall in growth expectations will tend to be reflected in a lower      expected path of risk-free rates, pushing down on bond yields. So a decline in growth expectations will tend to      widen the spread between equity and bond yields. Since equity prices depend on earnings expectations at all      future horizons, the equity yield (and hence the equity-bond yield spread) will be particularly sensitive to      expectations about growth rates at long horizons   BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                                7                                                                                                      Chart 9                                         Consistent downward revisions to GDP growth forecasts                                                                           Actual GDP growth                        2011                                                                           2012                                     2013                                                                           2014                                     2015                                                                           2016                                     Per cent                                                                                                                    2016                                                                                                                          8.0                                                                                     Dotted lines = Emerging economies                                                                                     Solid lines = Advanced economies                                                                                                                                     6.0                                                                                                                                       4.0                                                                                                                                       2.0                                                                                                                                       0.0                                                            2010         2011                  2012   2013   2014      2015   2016                                          Source: IMF World Economic Outlook.

2016-09-28	"Mark Carney: Resolving the climate paradox Text of the Arthur Burns Memorial Lecture by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, Berlin, 22 September 2016.                                                     *     *    *  I am grateful to Alice Carr, Carsten Jung, Ben Nelson and Iain de Weymarn for their assistance in preparing these remarks.   I.          Introduction It is an honour to give the Arthur Burns Memorial Lecture. In Arthur Burns� day, financial diplomacy was limited to weighty issues of monetary policy coordination, particularly the search for a new international monetary system following the collapse of Bretton Woods. Your invitation to discuss climate change is a sign of the broadening of the responsibilities of central banks to include financial as well as monetary stability. It also demonstrates the changing nature of international financial diplomacy. The quest for a renewal of the Bretton Woods treaty, with associated protocols and enforcement mechanisms, has been replaced with the more flexible governance of the G20 and the FSB. These groups gather principals who work together to forge consensus and implement global solutions to common problems. When I spoke at Lloyd�s of London a year ago about the financial stability risks arising from climate change, I, in effect, highlighted two paradoxes. 1 First, the future will be past. That is, climate change is a tragedy of the horizon which imposes a cost on future generations that the current one has no direct incentive to fix. The catastrophic impacts of climate change will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most actors including businesses and central banks. Once climate change becomes a clear and present danger to financial stability it may already be too late to stabilise the atmosphere at two degrees. The second paradox is that success is failure. That is, too rapid a movement towards a low- carbon economy could materially damage financial stability. A wholesale reassessment of prospects, as climate-related risks are re-evaluated, could destabilise markets, spark a pro- cyclical crystallisation of losses and lead to a persistent tightening of financial conditions: a climate Minsky moment. Resolving these conundrums requires first distinguishing the three channels through which climate change affects financial stability. The first concerns the physical risks that arise from the increased frequency and severity of climate- and weather-related events that damage property and disrupt trade. At present, general insurers are on the front line. 2 Thus far, a combination of sophisticated forecasting, a forward-looking European insurance capital regime and business models built around short-term coverage has left insurers relatively well-placed to manage physical risks. 3   1    See Carney (2016), �Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon � climate change and financial stability�, speech      given at Lloyd�s of London, September 2015. 2      While the attribution of increases in claims to specific factors is complex, work done at Lloyd�s of London      estimated that the 20cm rise in sea-level at the tip of Manhattan since the 1950s, when all other factors are      held constant, increased insured losses from Superstorm Sandy by 30% in New York alone. See Lloyd�s of      London (2014), �Catastrophe Modelling and Climate Change�. 3      As described in Prudential Regulation Authority, (2015), �The impact of climate change on the UK insurance      sector�.    BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                   1 Which is why Warren Buffett can observe that climate change is not a threat to Berkshire Hathaway�s insurance business. 4 Insurers have to update their models constantly and adjust coverage prudently. And in time, growing swathes of our economies could become uninsurable absent public backstops � hardly the prescription for a growing business. 5 Moreover, if coverage is not maintained, the broader financial system would become increasingly exposed to large and variable physical risks. With their motives as global citizens sharpened by commercial concerns, insurers have some of the greatest incentives to understand and tackle climate change in the short term. For example, Lloyd�s of London underwriters are required to consider climate change explicitly in their business plans and underwriting models. Their genius has been to recognise that past is not prologue and that the catastrophic norms of the future are in the tail risks of today. With such insights, it is perhaps not surprising that the insurance sector has been particularly active in organising itself to address these existential issues. 6 The second channel concerns liability risks. These stem from parties who have suffered loss from the effects of climate change seeking compensation from those they hold responsible. Such claims could arise well into the future, as the science and evidence of climate change hardens, though some are already taking action against companies on the grounds of failure to disclose the risks posed to their business models by climate change. 7 The final and most important channel involves transition risks, which could result from the adjustment towards a lower-carbon economy. Changes in policy, technology and physical risks could prompt a reassessment of the value of a large range of assets as costs and opportunities become apparent. The speed at which such re-pricing occurs is uncertain but could be decisive for financial stability. There have already been a few high profile examples of jump-to-distress pricing because of shifts in environmental policy or performance. Tonight, I would like to discuss how building new markets � in climate transition and green finance � can help resolve the tragedy of the horizon. Over the past year, the focus of G20 Leaders and the aegis of the FSB have spurred important progress. The upcoming German presidency of the G20 now has a historic chance to mainstream climate finance and turn risk into opportunity. To add impetus, there is also a growing macroeconomic case for action. Let me begin with that imperative.     4   Buffet noted �insurance policies are customarily written for one year and repriced annually to reflect changing     exposures. Increased possibilities of loss translate promptly into increased premiums�. See:     http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html. 5   The report �Risky Business � the economic risks of climate change in the United States� (2014) suggests that     in the USA $238�507 billion worth of coastal property could be below sea level by 2100. 6   The Insurance Development Forum was formed in 2015 as a public-private partnership between the United     Nations Development Programme, the World Bank and the insurance sector to use the industry�s expertise to     insure people in developing countries who are unprotected but vulnerable to climate change risk. This     protection gap currently represents 90% of the economic costs of natural disasters that are uninsured. 7   In late 2015, the New York Attorney General launched an investigation into allegedly insufficient disclosure of     climate change risk by a large energy company; Attorneys General in numerous US states have since joined     this investigation or launched their own.    2                                                                                          BIS central bankers� speeches II.            The macroeconomic imperative Throughout this decade, global growth has serially disappointed as the combination of huge debt overhangs, profound demographic changes and enormous uncertainties have weighed on activity (Chart 1). 8 Nominal growth in the euro area, the UK and globally, is running at half of its pre-crisis rate.

Each line shows how forecasts for a particular calendar year have       evolved over time. The diamond shows the eventual outturn.   Growth has been weak despite significant progress repairing the financial system, recent moves to somewhat expansionary fiscal policies in a number of countries, and of course, years of unprecedented monetary policies.     8      See Carney (2016), �Uncertainty, the economy and policy�, speech given at the Court Room, Bank of        England, June 2016.

Further restraining growth is a deep risk aversion amongst businesses and investors stemming from a combination of elevated geopolitical, economic and policy uncertainties (Chart 2). This has particularly affected business investment. Across advanced economies, investment has fallen by more than 2� percentage points of GDP (Chart 3), creating substantial investment shortfalls, relative to pre-crisis trends, of around 20% in Germany and 25% in the UK and US (Chart 4). In financial markets, despite a recovery in equities in recent years, equity risk premia are unusually high and government bond yields are consistent with very low growth for a very long time (Chart 5). 9 In short, both business and investors appear to be hedging future disaster risk.     9     In the UK and Germany, real interest rates are negative as far as the eye can see. Even in the US, real       30-year rates are well below 1%. Low bond yields suggest that market is discounting low future growth,       accounting for some of the wedge between those yields and equity dividend yields. Indeed, year in, year out,       earnings forecasts have proven wildly optimistic. However, risk premia are also likely playing a role. Put       simply, investors are not only less optimistic about future growth, but are also less certain about that subdued       outlook. They are demanding a discount on risky assets to compensate, and seeking risk-free assets instead.    4                                                                                                                   BIS central bankers� speeches                             Chart 3                                                                          Chart 4      Advanced economy investment has                                            Whole economy real investment       fallen relative to GDP and remains                                          substantially weaker than            lower than past episodes                                                  pre-crisis forecasts           1980             1989                                                 Residual                              Equipment                                           pp fall in investment                 Non-residential                       Residential                       Per cent           2001             2007                   share of GDP                  Total                                                             1.0                                                                                                  10                                                             0.5                                                                                                                                                                  0                                                             0.0                                                             -0.5                                                                                                 -10                                                             -1.0                                                                                                                                                                  -20                                                             -1.5                                                             -2.0                                                                                                 -30                                                             -2.5                                                             -3.0                                                                                                 -40                                                              -3.5                                                                                                 -50                                                             -4.0                                                             -4.5                                                                                                 -60                                                                                                                                              Switzerland                                                                                 Italy                                                                                                                                    Germany                                                                                                                                                            Sweden                                                                                                             US                                                                                                                              UK                                                                                          Denmark                                                                         Spain                                                                                                        France                                                                                                                     Canada    T    T+1 T+2 T+3 T+4 T+5 T+6 T+7 T+8                           Years    Source: IMF World Economic Outlook and Bank                           Source: IMF World Economic Outlook and Bank calculations.                                                         calculations.

The equity-bond yield spread  is the difference between the reciprocal of the FTSE All-Share price-earnings ratio and the UK 10-year  government bond yield. The growth contribution is calibrated from the IMF 5-year-ahead world growth and  inflation forecasts. The ERP contribution is calibrated using the VAR model described in Chin and Polk (2015),  �A forecast evaluation of expected equity return measures�, Bank of England Working Paper, No. 520.     BIS central bankers� speeches                                                                                                                                          5 The Bank of England has long stressed that central bank policies are not the cause of low rates but responses to them. 10 We are actors in a play written by others. 11 That is because the level at which interest rates must ultimately settle to ensure demand consistent with supply and so inflation at target � the �equilibrium� interest rate, or �r*� � is determined, not by central banks, but by the real, fundamental factors driving desired savings and investment in the global economy. These include technology growth, demographics, the ease of financial intermediation, and inequality. Colleagues at the Bank have estimated that such factors have conspired to lower real interest rates by around 450 basis points since the early 1980s. 12 Long-run prosperity was never in the gift of monetary policy makers. As the 10th anniversary of the start of the crisis approaches, a consensus is growing that escaping this low-growth low-inflation trap will require a rebalancing between monetary, fiscal and structural policies. The last are the most important. In addition to their merits in raising potential growth directly, structural reforms could improve the savings and investment balance, thereby increasing equilibrium interest rates (r*) and giving monetary policy more traction. Bank staff estimate that shortfalls in public investment represent only a modest portion of the 450 basis points fall in global interest rates since the early 1980s. Clear policy frameworks that encourage sustained private investment are thus essential, including those that mobilise private investment to finance the transition to the low-carbon economy. As I will discuss, the magnitudes required are significant, the horizons long, and the distribution Pareto improving. Theory suggests capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies � where the returns are highest. For long spells, however, the opposite has happened, confounding the textbooks and further driving down advanced economy bond yields. And on the occasions when capital has flowed to emerging markets, it has been too volatile, amplified cycles, distorted asset prices and fed credit imbalances in recipient countries. In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted. By absorbing excess global saving, equilibrium interest rates can be raised and macroeconomic stability enhanced. And by allocating capital to green technologies, the prospects for an environmentally sustainable recovery in global growth will increase. Seizing this opportunity requires a comprehensive climate policy framework.  III.          Paris brings forward the horizon With the Paris Agreement, governments have stepped up. In a display of international coordination of which Arthur Burns would have been proud, world leaders committed to curb carbon emissions and limit the rise in global average temperatures     10     See Carney (2013), �The spirit of the season�, speech to the Economic Club of New York; Broadbent (2014),        �Monetary policy, asset prices and distribution�, speech at the Society of Business Economists Annual        Conference; Bank of England Inflation Report, February 2014, page 40. 11     See Broadbent (ibid.). 12     See Rachel, L and Smith, T (2015), �Secular drivers of the global real interest rate�, Bank of England Working        Paper No. 571.    6                                                                                            BIS central bankers� speeches relative to those in the pre-industrial world to 2�C, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5�C. 13 Underpinning the Paris Agreement is recognition that the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere should not exceed the remaining carbon budget, which according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) amounts to 1000 gigatonnes of CO2 from 2011 onwards. 14 Countries have set their ambitions by submitting their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). 15 At present, these commitments are of varying degrees of specificity, and most still need to be fleshed out to be consistent with the aggregate carbon budget. The Paris Agreement requires that NDCs be updated regularly and that each should be a progression on the last. Crucially, the Paris Agreement provided an objective assessment that, even if all of the policies implied by the Agreement were implemented, global temperatures would rise by at least 2.7 degrees by 2100. 16 In other words, the world has committed to do something, but not yet enough to meet its stated goals. Therefore, Paris clarifies actual and stretch objectives. It provides detailed climate policies and creates the prospect of a future ratcheting up of efforts. In doing so, it greatly increases transition risks as well as opportunities. By bringing forward the horizon, it puts a premium on the ability of private markets to adjust.  IV.         Building a market in transition to a low-carbon economy Smooth adjustment is crucial because transition risks are how success could turn into failure. Specifically, sudden changes in policy, technology and physical risks could prompt a reassessment of asset values as costs and opportunities become apparent. In other words, an abrupt resolution of the tragedy of horizons is in itself a financial stability risk. We have already seen cases where there have been sharp changes in valuations. The combined market capitalisation of the top four US coal producers has fallen by over 99% since the end of 2010, and three have recently filed for bankruptcy (Chart 6). 17 There has been similar, albeit less acute, drama for the more diversified German utilities (Chart 7).     13    See United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, �Paris Agreement�, 2015, available at:       http://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf. 14    IPCC Synthesis Report (2014) and Bank calculations, in Batten, S, Sowerbutts, R, and Tanaka, M, �Let�s talk       about the weather: the impact of climate change on central banks�, Bank of England Staff Working Paper       (2016). 15    For example, the US will seek to reduce emissions against 2005 levels by 26�28% by 2025; China will seek to       reduce against 2005 levels by 40�45% also by 2025 and the European Union will seek to reduce by more       than 40% against 1990 levels by 2030. 16    See United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, (2015). 17    Those filing for bankruptcy were Peabody Energy, Arch Coal and Alpha Natural.

The legacy of a searing financial crisis weighing on confidence and growth.    The very nature of work disrupted by a technological revolution.                                   th   This was the middle of the 19 century.    Liverpool was in the midst of a golden age; its Custom House was the national Exchequer�s biggest source   of revenue.    And Karl Marx was scribbling in the British Library, warning of a spectre haunting Europe, the spectre of   communism.    We meet today during the first lost decade since the 1860s.    In the wake of a global financial crisis.    And in the midst of a technological revolution that is once again changing the nature of work.    Substitute Northern Rock for Overend Gurney; Uber and machine learning for the Spinning Jenny and the   steam engine; and Twitter for the telegraph; and you have dynamics that echo those of 150 years ago.    Then the villains were the capitalists. Should they today be the central bankers? Are their flights of fancy                                                                                                      i   promoting stagnation and inequality? Does the spectre of monetarism haunt our economies?    These are serious charges, based on real anxieties. They merit sober, objective assessment.    This evening I want to discuss the role of monetary policy in this time of great disruption. But first I will focus   on the underlying causes and consequences of weak real income growth and inequality across the   advanced world.    That�s because any doctor knows that the importance of diagnosing the underlying causes of the patient�s   symptoms before administering the cure. Monetary policy has been keeping the patient alive, creating the   possibility of a lasting cure through fiscal and structural operations. It has averted depression and helped   advanced economies live to fight another day, so that measures to restore vitality can be taken.    II. The Great Disruption    During the last quarter century there have been a series of profound disruptions to the way we work, trade,   consume and live. The fall of the Berlin Wall and the reforms initiated by Deng Xiaoping led to the   integration of a third of humankind into the global labour force. Those workers are increasingly linked by   global supply chains that have spread from goods to services. In parallel, an explosion of technological   innovations has brought access, at the click of a virtual button, to the sum of human knowledge to three-and-   a-half billion people (Chart 1).                                                                                                                     2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                   2   The deepening of the symbiotic relationship between global markets and technological progress has lifted   more than a billion people out of poverty (Chart 2), while a series of technological advances have   fundamentally enriched our lives.

Globally, since 1960, real per capita GDP has risen more than two-and-a-half times (Chart 3), average                                             ii   incomes have begun to converge, and life expectancy has increased by nearly two decades (Chart 4).    Despite such immense progress, many citizens in advanced economies are facing heightened uncertainty,   lamenting a loss of control and losing trust in the system. To them, measures of aggregate progress bear   little relation to their own experience. Rather than a new golden era, globalisation is associated with low   wages, insecure employment, stateless corporations and striking inequalities.    These anxieties have been compounded by the twin crises of solvency and integrity at the heart of finance.   When the financial crisis hit, the world�s largest banks were shown to be operating in a �heads-I-win-tails-   you-lose� bubble; widespread rigging of some core markets was exposed; and masters of the universe   became minions. Few in positions of responsibility took theirs. Shareholders, taxpayers and citizens paid   the heavy price.    As a consequence of all these developments, public support for open markets is under threat.    Turning our backs on open markets would be a tragedy, but it is a possibility. It can only be averted by   confronting the underlying reasons for this risk upfront.                                                                                                                                                 3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                            3   Chart 3: Real GDP per capita more than                                  Chart 4: Life expectancy at birth up around   doubled since 1960                                                      two decades since 1960                                                   Index 1960 = 1                                                                     Years                                                                    3.0                                                                   75                         GDP per capita (constant                                            World life expectancy at birth, total                        2010 US$)                                                           (years)                                                                                                                                         70                                                                    2.5                                                                                                                                           65                                                                     2.0                                                                                                                                          60                                                                      1.5                                                                                                                                         55                                                                       1.0                                                                  50    1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015              1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010    Source: World Bank                                                      Source: World Bank      Real income growth has been meagre, compounding unequal distribution.    The cry for more inclusive growth starts with a crisis of growth itself. To put it mildly, the performance of the   advanced economies over the past ten years has consistently disappointed (Chart 5).

Globally, we are tracking that pattern, with overall activity   9% below its pre-crisis trend nine years on.    Even by these standards, however, advanced economy recoveries have been unusually tepid, with their   current level of activity around 13% lower than the pre-crisis trend.    In the UK the shortfall, at 16%, is even worse. Over the past decade real earnings have grown at the   slowest rate since the mid-19th Century (Chart 6).    Weak income growth has focused growing attention on its distribution. Inequalities which might have been   tolerated during generalised prosperity are felt more acutely when economies stagnate.    In recent decades, as global inequality has fallen markedly, it has edged ever higher in most advanced   economies. In Anglo-Saxon countries, the income share of the top 1% has risen notably since 1980.

Such high income inequalities are dwarfed by staggering wealth inequalities. The proportion of the wealth                                                                                                        v   held by the richest 1% of Americans increased from 25% in 1990 to 40% in 2012. Globally, the share of                                                                                                                 vi   wealth held by the richest 1% in the world rose from one-third in 2000 to one-half in 2010.    The picture in the UK is complex but in general suggests relatively stable but high levels of overall inequality,   with sharper disparities emerging in recent times for the top 1%. When combined with low growth of incomes   and entrenched intergenerational inequity, it is no wonder that many question their prospects.                                                                                                                                     5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                  5   For example, a common measure of the distribution of income, the Gini coefficient, shows that inequality   rose sharply during the 1980s and has more or less plateaued ever since (Chart 7). That suggests a large   structural shift during the Thatcher era, followed by a more modest series of adjustments thereafter.   However, possibly because of the effects of globalisation, the income share of the top 1% tripled from 5% in   the early 1980s to 15% by 2009, though it has fallen back somewhat since the crisis (Chart 8).    The distribution of wealth also appears to have been relatively flat since the mid-1990s (Chart 9), partly                                                        vii   reflecting the pattern of home ownership, though it is much less equal than for income, with the share of the                                                              viii   richest 1% persistently high, at around 20%.    For both income and wealth, some of the most significant shifts have happened across generations. A typical                                                                                                            ix   millennial earned �8,000 less during their twenties than their predecessors.

Moreover, rising real house   prices between the mid-1990s and the late 2000s has created a growing disparity between older home   owners and younger renters (Chart 10).

III. The Way Forward    Given these developments, the challenge is how to manage and moderate the forces of innovation and   integration which breed aggregate prosperity for the economy as a whole but which also foster isolation and   detachment for substantial proportions of the population.    In the balance of my remarks, I will focus on three priorities for doing so.    First, economists must clearly acknowledge the challenges we face, including the realities of uneven   gains from trade and technology.    Second, we must grow our economy by rebalancing the mix of monetary policy, fiscal policy and   structural reforms.    Third, we need to move towards more inclusive growth where everyone has a stake in globalisation.                                                                                                                                             7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                       7   Most potential solutions lie outside the Bank�s remit. But let me say a bit about each of these priorities   concentrating on how the Bank of England can contribute to more inclusive growth via the impact of its   policies on uncertainty, trust and inequality.        (a) Acknowledge current challenges and address them, wherever possible.    Given their recent experiences, it is not surprising that people are largely ignoring pieties about the virtues of   open markets and new technologies, and that they discount assertions that �they�ve never had it so good.� A   more inclusive growth requires frank talk about risks and concrete initiatives to help people adjust to new   realities.    Trade and technology do not raise all boats    Consider the disconnect between economists and workers. The former have not been sufficiently upfront   about the distributional consequences of rapid changes in technology and globalisation. Amongst                                                    xiv   economists, a belief in free trade is totemic.         But, while trade makes countries better off, it does not raise all                                                                                     xv   boats; in the clinical words of the economist, trade is not Pareto optimal.    Rather, the benefits from trade are unequally spread across individuals and time. Consumers get lower   prices and new product varieties, and, over time, benefit from the spur to innovate and higher productivity.   Some workers, however, lose their jobs and the dignity of work, or see their �factor prices� � in plain English,   wages � equalised downwards.                                                                                      xvi   Such dynamics have been recognised by trade theory for over 75 years.                   And they are felt by those at   either end of the great convergence. Survey evidence shows that 70% of Chinese workers believe that trade                                       xvii   creates jobs and increases wages,          US households think the opposite, and UK public opinion is                xviii   equivocal.    People�s attitudes towards trade shocks are being hardened by the effects of accelerating technological   innovation. As my colleague Andy Haldane has explained, up to 15 million of the current jobs in Britain could                             xix   be automated over time.    The fundamental challenge is that, alongside its great benefits, every technological revolution mercilessly   destroys jobs and livelihoods � and therefore identities � well before the new ones emerge. This was true of   the eclipse of agriculture and cottage industry by the industrial revolution, the displacement of manufacturing   by the service economy, and now the hollowing out of many of those middle-class services jobs through   machine learning and global sourcing.    The combination of open markets and technology means that returns in a globalised world amplifies the   rewards of the superstar and the lucky. Now may be the time of the famous or fortunate, but what of the   frustrated and frightened?                                                                                                                              8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                         8   Uncertainty is very high    From the rising spectre of global terrorism to intensifying geopolitical tensions and financial crises, for too   long, for far too many people, the world seems to be getting riskier.    They are right. Currently, on average across Europe and the US, policy uncertainty is around 1.5 standard                                                   xx   deviations above its historical average. In the UK, we expect currently elevated levels of uncertainty to cut   7% from investment over the next three years and 1% from GDP.    Higher uncertainty has contributed to what psychologists call an affect heuristic amongst households,   businesses and investors. Put simply, long after the original trigger becomes remote, perceptions endure,   affecting risk perceptions and economic behaviour. Just like those who lived through the Great Depression,   people appear more cautious about the future and more reluctant to take irreversible decisions.    That means less willingness to put capital to work and, ultimately, lower growth.    These dynamics are clearly visible in financial markets. As one illustration, for two-and-a-half centuries, the   prices of government bonds and the prices of equities tended to move together: the typical bull market   entails rising equity prices and falling bond yields, with the reverse in bear markets (Chart 11). Since the                                                                                                                                          xxi   mid-2000s, however, this pattern has reversed and bond yields have tended to fall along with equity prices.

2016-12-16	Remarks on the launch of the Recommendations of the Task   Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures     Mark Carney   Chair of the Financial Stability Board   Governor of the Bank of England       Delivered at the Tate Modern   14 December 2016                                                                                                             1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx   Welcome     It is my great pleasure to have been invited, in my capacity as Chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), to   help launch the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures consultative report.                                                   1   In late 2015, at the request of the G20 , the FSB established this private-sector, industry-led Task Force,   under the leadership of Michael Bloomberg.     Its mandate was to develop recommendations for voluntary, consistent, comparable, clear and reliable   disclosures around climate-related financial risks for companies. The purpose was to provide the information   that investors, lenders, insurers and other stakeholders need to manage these risks, and seize the   associated opportunities.     As those of you who�ve had an opportunity to read their report will have seen, the Task Force has achieved a   great deal during the year.     So on behalf of shareholders, creditors and citizens, I thank all of the Task Force members for their   tremendous efforts, and your companies for making you available for this important work. If you want a job   done well, give it to busy people.     Public authorities � like the G20 and the FSB � could identify the problem, but we needed the private-sector   to provide the solution.     This is a solution for the market, by the market.     The Task Force members are drawn from the private sector from across advanced and emerging G20   economies, including major companies, large investors, global banks and insurers, all the major accounting                                          2   firms and credit rating agencies.     As such, the Task Force represents a true cross-section of those who prepare, demand and use   climate-related financial disclosures.     Let me briefly recap the financial stability imperative to act on climate-related financial risks     From rising sea levels to more severe storms and more intense droughts, climate change is already   presenting physical risks    1      The G20 had asked, in its April 2015 Communique, that the FSB �convene public- and private-sector participants to review how the   financial sector can take account of climate-related issues�.   2      A full list of Task Force members can be found at: https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/about/#                                                                                                                                         2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                       2   Since the 1980s the number of registered weather-related loss events has tripled. Inflation-adjusted   insurance losses from these events have increased fivefold since the 1980s to around $50bn over the past             3   decade.     Insurers are therefore amongst those with the greatest commercial incentives to understand and tackle   climate change in the short term. Their response here in London is at the cutting edge of the understanding   and management of such risks.     For example, Lloyd�s of London underwriters were the first to use storm records to mesh natural science with   finance in order to analyse changing weather patterns. Today Lloyd�s underwriters are required to consider   climate change explicitly in their business plans and underwriting models.     The bigger risks and opportunities are still to come for nearly every industry.     Public policy, consumer demand and technological innovation are all driving a shift towards a low carbon   economy. A year ago in Paris, 195 countries committed to limit the rise in global average temperatures to   less than 2�C, with 117 countries having now ratified that commitment.     So citizens, consumers, businesses, governments, and international organisations are all taking action. And   entrepreneurs are developing disruptive technologies that will create and destroy value.     But which financial institutions are best positioned to gain and which to lose from this transition? Which   companies and industries are most, and least, dependent on fossil fuels? Which businesses are most   vulnerable to potential damage from rising physical risks? In every case, which firms have the governance,   resources and the strategy to manage, and profit from, these major shifts?     At present, the challenge is that investors currently don�t have the information they need to answer to these   questions. This must change if financial markets are going to do what they do best: allocate capital to   manage risks and seize new opportunities. Without the necessary information, market adjustments to climate   change will be incomplete, late and potentially destabilising.     But with the right information, financial markets can smooth the transition to a 2-degree world. Risks to   financial stability will be reduced if the transition to a low carbon economy begins early and follows a   predictable path.       3    See Carney (2016), �Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon � climate change and financial stability�, speech given at Lloyd�s of London,   September 2015.                                                                                                                                      3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                      3   Of course, given the uncertainties around climate, not everyone will agree on the timing or the scale of   adjustments required to achieve this goal. But the right information will allow optimists and pessimists,   sceptics and evangelists, to back their convictions with their capital.     The main obstacle standing in the way of a smooth and timely market-led adjustment has been the absence   of quality information on climate-related financial risks and opportunities.     As the Task Force has highlighted, a significant number of climate-disclosure regimes � indeed on some                           4   counts around 400 � already exist. But existing schemes vary in their status, coverage and ambition.     For example, while 80% of Fortune 500 companies participate in one of the existing schemes, it remains the   case that only around a third of the top 1,000 US companies produce broadly comparable information on the   climate-related financial risks they face.     The Task Force�s report � presented to you today � shows the way forward.     Let me highlight some of its recommendations that will make a major contribution.     The first breakthrough is a disclosure framework that it sufficiently comprehensive for use by all   publicly-listed companies, whatever their sector, across the full set of climate-related financial risks they face.     The recommendations are designed to leverage, rather than replace, existing disclosure regimes.     So the Task Force has set out how firms can comply more effectively with existing disclosure obligations, by   disclosing their climate-related financial risks and opportunities in their mainstream financial reports.     In turn, this should ensure that consideration of climate-related financial risk, and opportunities, is properly   embedded within, and subject to, firms� corporate governance and risk management. Reporting on these   risks cannot remain a niche activity.     Decision-useful, actionable information     The disclosure recommendations deliver actionable information that will be useful in decision making. In   particular, they focus on four areas critical to how real-world businesses operate: governance, strategy, risk   management, and metrics.       4       See OECD (2015), �Climate Change Disclosure in G20 countries�.                                                                                                                      4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                    4   The expectation is that qualitative and narrative disclosures will be complemented with quantitative ones as   is the case for other disclosures made in financial statements. These are grouped into the categories of   revenues, expenditures, assets and liabilities and capital.     More specifically, all firms, from energy giants through to consumer goods producers, are encouraged to   disclose their:         -   direct carbon emissions plus those from their energy consumption, in a consistent manner (i.e.           scope 1 and 2), complemented by any emission reduction targets that companies may set for           themselves.         -   these can be supplemented, where judged appropriate, with upstream and downstream (i.e. scope           3) emissions     At the same time, the Task Force has set out sector-specific guidance for those sectors with the biggest   carbon footprints and exposures. This will ensure investors know how much utility companies are investing   in low carbon alternatives. And what progress car manufacturers are making towards fuel efficiency.     Scenario analysis     The recommendations recognise also that static disclosures of current carbon footprints will not be sufficient   to reveal a company�s climate-related financial risks and opportunities.     For investors to price financial risks and opportunities correctly, they need to weigh firms� strategies against   plausible public policy developments, technological advances and evolving physical risks and opportunities.     In a ground breaking innovation, the Task Force recommends that companies explore and disclose the   potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on their businesses, strategies and financial   planning under different potential future scenarios.     A full exploration of transition risks may require consideration of financial risks and opportunities under   several scenarios, which firms may develop directly or using commonly available models. Reflecting the   commitments made in Paris, the Task Force recommends that this should include using a 2-degree scenario.     And consistent with the concept enshrined in the Paris Agreement of common but differentiated   responsibilities, transition scenarios could take account of different national targets for emissions reduction.   This makes them particularly useful for companies headquartered in emerging economies.                                                                                                                      5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                5   Over time, the Task Force expects to see a greater emphasis on quantitative analyses in scenario-related   disclosures, including the underlying assumptions associated with the climate-related scenarios used.     Scope extends to asset owners and managers.     A further important feature is the expectation that, where available, asset managers and owners will make   disclosures of the aggregate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions embedded in their investment portfolios.     Achieving broad coverage will take time and obviously depends on adoption by issuers.     Implementation     We are pleased that all Task Force member organisations, companies with market capitalisations of around   $1.5 trillion and financial institutions responsible for assets of $20 trillion, have today announced their                                                          5   support for the disclosure recommendations.     With better disclosure, a market in the transition to a 2-degree world can be built. That market will expose the   likely future cost of doing business, of paying for emissions, and of changing processes given both those   charges and tighter regulation. And it will help smooth price adjustments as opinions change, rather than   concentrating them in a short, dangerous space of time.     Early disclosure rules allowed 20th-century financial markets to grow our economies by pricing risks more   accurately. The spread of such standards internationally has helped lift more than a billion people out of   poverty. Climate-related disclosures could be as transformative for 21st-century markets.       5       Bloomberg data and Bank calculations using market capitalisation as at 12 December 2016 and assets at end-2015.                                                                                                                         6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                       6

It is a pleasure to be at the LSE and an honour to share the podium with Amartya Sen.    Professor Sen is rightly recognised for his many contributions, not least to welfare economics and social   choice theory. He has posed, and in many cases answered, some of the most fundamental questions facing   economists. For example, given the diversity of people�s preferences, is it possible to arrive at coherent   aggregative judgements about how society is arranged? If there are as many preferences as there are   people, is reasonable social choice possible at all? And how do we value public goods?    His work underscores the value of empirics � informational broadening � to help make the interpersonal   comparisons necessary to understand, and act upon, the force of public concerns about poverty, inequality,   even tyranny. And his insights have been applied to the most pressing economic and ethical questions,   such as the prevention of famines.    His insights are also relevant to social choices about macroeconomic stabilisation, including inflation control,   and what society is prepared to do to achieve it.    What level of inflation does society wish to achieve? How aggressively should inflation stabilisation be   pursued when doing so imposes costs in terms of lost output and higher unemployment?    Low, stable and predictable inflation is a public good. It is not merely that rising prices mean households   have to shop around or businesses have to update their prices periodically. High inflation hurts those,   particularly the worst off in society, who don�t hold equities or property as well as those whose incomes are   fixed in nominal terms. It distorts price signals, inhibits investment, and can ultimately damage the productive   potential of the economy.    Equally, deflation can imperil growth and employment. In a highly indebted economy, deflation raises real   interest rates, increases debt burdens, lowers wages, and reduces growth. In the extreme, these can morph   into debt deflation, causing very high and persistent unemployment and financial collapse.    The happy medium is low, stable, predictable inflation over the medium term. A little inflation �greases the                                                                                                             1   wheels� of the economy, for example by helping real wages adjust more smoothly. Moreover, a positive   inflation rate gives monetary policy space to deliver better outcomes for jobs and growth when shocks hit,                                                                               2   without the distortionary costs of high and volatile inflation.    Recognising the social value of inflation control is one thing, delivering it is quite another.    In the past, many societies could not. This is because the instrument that affects inflation most powerfully �   monetary policy � also affects output and employment, at least in the short run. That influence tempted    1     See Tobin (1972), �Inflation and unemployment�, American Economic Review, 62.   2     Inflation can have large redistributive effects. Volatile inflation arbitrarily re-distributes wealth across borrowers and savers. And most   recently, there has been a debate about how the stance of monetary policy has affected the distribution of wealth and income. In a   series of recent analysis and speeches, members of the MPC have shown that, while distribution is not an objective of monetary policy,   the evidence strongly suggests that policy since the crisis has been associated with better outcomes.                                                                                                                                             2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches                                                          2   authorities to promise low inflation in the future, but then to renege in order to boost activity. Electoral cycles                                         3   reinforced this predisposition. Firms and households began to anticipate these incentives, however, and   eventually pre-empt them. The economy ended up in a worse equilibrium with higher inflation and                       4   unemployment. Such time-inconsistent policies contributed to excessive inflation and higher structural   unemployment in the UK during the 1970s and 1980s (when inflation averaged 9.5% and unemployment   over 7.5%).    In light of similar experiences, many societies came to recognise that macro outcomes can be improved by   having society first choose the preferred rate of inflation and then delegate operational responsibility to the                                                                                                                  5   monetary authority to take the necessary monetary actions to achieve that objective. By �tying the hands� of   authorities, time inconsistency is resolved and better outcomes for both inflation and unemployment become   possible.    Inflation targeting, as practised in the UK, represents the most comprehensive adoption of these insights. By   delegating monetary policy to an operationally independent central bank, inflation control becomes a more                                                                                                                                  6   technical, �engineering� problem, as described in Professor Sen�s work on ethics and economics. The   committee responsible is given a clear remit � with a lexicographic preference for inflation control � and is   charged to do what is necessary to achieve the inflation target over the policy horizon. For example, the   Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England must deliver price stability over the medium term,   as defined by 2% CPI inflation. The inflation target is symmetric (meaning we care as much about returning   inflation to target from below as from above), and it applies at all times.    To be clear, although the method by which the Bank of England achieves the inflation target may be a   technical exercise, the UK�s monetary policy framework is grounded in society�s choice of the desired end.   These ethical determinations are encoded in the monetary policy remit, from which the MPC takes its orders   and against which it is accountable. Society chooses the ends, and, within pre-set boundaries, the MPC   determines the means to achieve them.    Yet even in this framework monetary policymaking will at times involve striking short-term trade-offs between   stabilising inflation and supporting growth and employment. In other words, the monetary policy problem   cannot be fully contracted ex ante. But to re-emphasise, decisions about the precise trade-off that the MPC   pursues are subject to the limits provided by its statutory objectives and the Chancellor�s remit. And they are   disciplined by the transparency and accountability mechanisms including Inflation Reports, the minutes and   transcripts of its meetings, the Parliamentary testimonies of its members, the open letter process triggered if     3     Nordhaus, W D (1975), �The political business cycle�, Review of Economic Studies.   4     See, inter alia, Kydland, F and Prescott, E, (1977), �Rules rather than discretion: the inconsistency of optimal plans�, Journal of   Political Economy, 85(3), 473-492; Barro, R, and Gordon, D B, (1983).

The balance of my remarks this evening will concentrate on the experience with such trade-offs, which have   become more common of late for two reasons. First, since the global financial crisis, the UK economy has   been subject to a series of major supply shocks, which, for reasons that I will explain, create a tension   between short-term inflation and output stabilisation. And second, there has been a renewed recognition   that, in extreme circumstances, the monetary authority may have to take into account financial stability   considerations in setting monetary policy with potential consequences for the short-term path of inflation   control.    These are big decisions, decisions subject to considerable uncertainty, and decisions which entail potentially   large welfare costs, arising from high unemployment and unevenly distributed costs of inflation. They   deserve scrutiny to ensure that they are consistent with society�s preferences as expressed in statute and   remit.    1. Monetary policy remit    For most of the Bank�s history, an assessment of whether it was acting in a way consistent with society�s   view of the public good could not be made.    As former Governor Eddie George remarked, during the half century that followed its nationalisation in 1946   �the Bank operated under legislation which, remarkably, did not attempt to define our objectives or functions.�                                                                                                           7   They were, instead, �assumed to carry over from [the Bank�s] earlier long history.� In that regard, the Bank�s   �constitution� resembled that of the United Kingdom more broadly, comprising a rich history of law, principle   and convention.    All changed with the passing of the Bank of England Act in 1998, which made specific �provision about the   constitution, regulation, financial arrangements and functions of the Bank.� The Act clarified the Bank�s   responsibilities and granted independence to the Bank for the operation of monetary policy. In delegating   authority to an independent body, the MPC, in this way, the Act ensured the Bank would operate under                                                               8   �constrained� rather than �unfettered� discretion. It would be accountable to Parliament for operating the   instruments of monetary policy to achieve the objectives of monetary policy, as determined by the   Government.    The operational independence of the Bank of England is an example of power flowing from the people via   Parliament within carefully circumscribed limits. Independence in turn demands accountability for the Bank to   command the legitimacy necessary to fulfil its mission. By publishing its analysis, giving testimony, and     7     George, E.

King attributes the �constrained� versus   �unfettered� distinction originally to Ben Bernanke and Frederick Mishkin.                                                                                                                                            4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches                                                       4   delivering speeches, the Bank explains how it is exercising its powers to achieve its clearly defined policy   remits.    Today, the MPC�s monetary policy remit requires it to achieve price stability, defined by the Government to   mean 12-month CPI inflation of 2%. The remit recognises that inflation may deviate temporarily from the   target on account of shocks, however. Since 2013, the remit has explicitly recognised that in these   circumstances, bringing inflation back to target too rapidly could cause volatility in output and employment   that is undesirable. The remit requires the MPC to consider, balance and explain such short-run monetary   policy trade-offs.    Specifically, in exceptional circumstances, �shocks to the economy may be particularly large or the effects of   shocks may persist over an extended period or both�. When this is the case, the challenge facing the MPC   can be more significant, and the remits directs that �[i]n forming and communicating its judgements, the   Committee should promote understanding of the trade-offs inherent in setting monetary policy�, including,   importantly �the horizon over which the Committee judges it is appropriate to return inflation to the target�.    2. Achieving price stability    A simple framework for thinking about how to manage the monetary policy trade-off is shown in Figure 1.   The red line in the figure illustrates a policymaker�s preferred trade-off: mapping the size of the shortfall of   output below potential � the output gap � that the policymaker is prepared to tolerate for a given overshoot of   inflation from target, and vice versa. The flatter the line the less the weight the policymaker places on output   stabilisation and the more they are willing to tolerate large output gaps in order to eliminate small overshoots   in inflation.

In the case of an inflationary shock that induces a                                                                        trade-off, the Phillips curve shifts up, as shown in the                                                                        figure.

The   slope of the Phillips curve is crucial in determining in the size of the fall in output needed to reduce inflation to   an acceptable level � the sacrifice ratio.

These shocks to aggregate demand can include                                                                       variations in government consumption, households�                                                                       desire to consume, or business� desire to invest.                                                                       Increases in demand put pressure on the use of                                                                       resources, causing prices to rise.

If successful, it can stabilise inflation.                                                                       In this case, no output-inflation trade-off arises. This                                                                                                                   10                                                                       is the so-called �divine coincidence�.    In Figure 2, negative demand shocks would create a tendency for inflation and the output gap to move into   the south-west quadrant. Similarly, for positive demand shocks, inflation and output gap would move to the   north-east. Because in these cases, there is no trade-off between stabilising inflation and the output gap, it is   relatively straightforward for monetary policy to keep inflation and the output gap close to the origin.

The measure of   calculations. The measure of inflation is the four-quarter                     inflation is the four-quarter change in the harmonised index of   change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE)                          consumer prices (HICP). The output gap is the IMF�s estimate   deflator. The output gap is calculated using the CBO estimate                  from the October 2016 WEO at an annual frequency,   of potential output from its August 2016 Update to the Budget                  interpolated to create a quarterly series.   and Economic Outlook.     12      Exchange rate shocks also have demand effects including via net trade. For example, a higher exchange rate lowers imported price   pressures, reducing inflation directly. It also makes domestic goods less attractive on world markets, lowering the contribution of net   trade to demand, which has second-round effects on inflation via the reduced demand of exporters for labour. At the same time, real   household income rises with a higher exchange rate, providing some countervailing support to demand and domestically-generated   inflation.                                                                                                                                                            7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches                                                                       7   In contrast, the US and the euro area have seldom faced a trade-off between output and inflation   stabilisation, even since the global financial crisis (Charts 3 and 4).    A simple way to represent more formally how the policymaker optimises the trade-off is in �linear-quadratic�   form � a set of linear constraints describing the behaviour of the economy, and quadratic preferences that   penalise deviations of inflation from its target and output from its potential. The relative weight the   policymaker places on output stabilisation, relative to inflation stabilisation, is often denoted ?? � or �lambda�.   The policymaker�s �loss function� in any particular time period is:                                                    ?????????? ? (???? ? ?? ? )2 + ??(???? ? ????? )2    where ???? is inflation, ?? ? is the inflation target, ???? is output and ????? is �trend� output, so that ???? ? ????? is the output                                                        13   gap, and ?? subscripts denote time periods.                The policymaker�s objective is to minimise the discounted sum   of these losses over time. In this formulation, a lambda of zero would imply no weight on the stabilisation of   real activity � so-called �inflation nutter� preferences. When lambda is positive, in contrast, the policymaker is   willing to strike at least some trade-off between output and inflation stabilisation, as directed by the MPC   remit.    This objective function is optimised subject to the constraints implied by the aggregate behaviour of the   economy, including the relationship between interest rates and activity; and the relationship between activity   and inflation � the Phillips curve shown in Figure 1. In essence, these suggest lower interest rates raise               14   activity;        and higher activity generates higher inflation.    Under this simple framework, in certain circumstances, the optimal policy balances inflation overshoots with   shortfalls of activity relative to potential, and vice versa for inflation undershoots. (A derivation appears in the   Annex.) The relative size of these two deviations is governed by the strength with which higher output   translates into higher inflation; and the preferences of the policymaker, or:                                                                      ??                                                         ???? ? ?? ? = ? (???? ? ????? )                                                                     ??    where ?? is the effect of the output gap on inflation. From this, it is clear that the higher is lambda, the greater   the weight placed on output stabilisation and the more a given shock is allowed to flow through to inflation.   As lambda shrinks to zero, the policymaker becomes an inflation nutter, with all of the adjustment to a shock   forced through the output gap in order to keep inflation very close to the target.    13      A �micro-founded� loss function resembling this can be derived in New Keynesian models, in which lambda is a function of the   underlying deep parameters in the economy (such as those governing the degree of price stickiness). These are typically based on the   representative agent assumption. A newer literature drops representative agent assumption. In this case, the �micro-founded loss   function� contains additional terms capturing some aspects of heterogeneity between households. For example, in a model with   borrowers and savers, a term in the loss function containing the �consumption gap� arises � measuring the gap between the   consumptions of the two types of household. The reason terms like this appear is that dropping the representative agent assumption   tends also to introduce additional frictions, like borrowing constraints. In the example given here, the �consumption gap� represents the   welfare loss due to imperfect risk-sharing (borrowers can�t smooth consumption as easily). Strictly speaking, this is something the   �social planner� should care about, even if the central bank, with a narrowly-defined inflation mandate, does not.   14      Lower interest rates, that is, relative to the equilibrium or �natural� interest rate.                                                                                                                                          8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches                                                      8   The slope of the trade-off is also affected by that of the Phillips curve. When the Phillips curve is flatter,                                                                                              15   output gaps of a given size result in larger inflation over- or under-shoots.

FinTech�s Shining Future     It is a pleasure to be at Schloss Biebrich as part of this Bundesbank conference on �Digitising finance,   financial inclusion and financial literacy.�     Just a few hours ago, I was in the world�s leading FinTech centre. One which generated �6.5 billion in                                                                                                                              1   revenue, attracted just over �500 million in investment and employed around 61,000 people in 2015.     From start-ups in London�s Silicon Roundabout to established players in The Valley, entrepreneurs are   applying their creativity and technical ingenuity along the financial services value chain.     To its advocates, this wave of innovation promises a FinTech revolution that will democratise financial   services.     Consumers will get more choice, better-targeted services and keener pricing.     Small and medium sized businesses will get access to new credit.     Banks will become more productive, with lower transaction costs, greater capital efficiency and stronger   operational resilience.     The financial system itself will become more resilient with greater diversity, redundancy and depth.     And most fundamentally, financial services will be more inclusive; with people better connected, more   informed and increasingly empowered.     With hundreds of millions now entering the digital financial system every year, could higher economic growth   and a quantum leap in social equity be on the horizon? Or will the range of new financial technologies   primarily make existing institutions and markets more efficient and effective? No small prize but hardly a   transformation.       1    See Ernst and Young, (2016), �FinTech on the Cutting Edge�: http://www.ey.com/uk/en/industries/financial-services/banking--capital-   markets/ey-uk-fintech-on-the-cutting-edge                                                                                                                                     2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                    2   Of course, technological innovation has long been twinned with finance. Today�s system is the product of   past advances, beginning with the simple ledger in the fifteenth century. Building on this foundation, a range   of innovations � from the telegraph in the 1860s to the digitalisation of the ledger a century later � have   created the plumbing of modern payments, clearing and settlement infrastructure necessary for global   financial institutions and cross-border, wholesale markets.     More recently, customer access has been opened up with the introduction of the first automated teller   machines of the 1960s, the arrival of online banking and brokerage in the 1980s, and the rapid rise of mobile   banking since the millennium.     Despite these advances, finance continues to be arranged around a series of hubs like brokers, clearing   houses and exchanges; whereas in other domains, people are increasingly forming connections directly,   instantaneously and openly, revolutionising how they communicate, work, and live.     The extent to which finance could be redrawn depends on superficially arcane, but fundamentally vital,   enabling technologies. The emergence of mobile telephony, the ubiquity of the internet, availability of   high-speed computing, advances in cryptography, and innovations in machine learning could all combine to   enable rapid changes in finance � just as they are in other areas of the economy.     FinTech�s true promise springs from its potential to unbundle banking into its core functions of: settling   payments, performing maturity transformation, sharing risk and allocating capital. This possibility is being   driven by new entrants � payment service providers, aggregators and robo advisors, peer-to-peer lenders,   and innovative trading platforms. And it is being influenced by incumbents who are adopting new   technologies in an effort to reinforce the economies of scale and scope of their business models.     In this process, systemic risks will evolve. Changes to customer loyalties could influence the stability of bank   funding. New underwriting models could impact credit quality and even macroeconomic dynamics. New   investing and risk management paradigms could affect market functioning. A host of applications and new   infrastructure could reduce costs, probably improve capital efficiency and possibly create new critical   economic functions.     The challenge for policymakers is to ensure that FinTech develops in a way that maximises the opportunities   and minimises the risks for society. After all, the history of financial innovation is littered with examples that   led to early booms, growing unintended consequences, and eventual busts.                                                                                                                        3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                  3   At the request of the German presidency, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) is considering the most   important financial stability issues associated with new financial technologies and, drawing on a stocktake of   national approaches, it is assessing the extent to which these risks are addressed by existing regulatory                  2   frameworks.     The FSB will report its findings to the G20 summit in July to promote the G20�s broader objectives for   financial inclusion and strong, sustainable and balanced growth.     In that spirit, this evening I would like to highlight some of the potential financial stability issues raised by the   FinTech revolution.          2. The Financial Services Value Chain     But first I should make a confession: I was a banker once.     To earn money for university tuition, I worked as a teller in my native Canada. To be more precise I was a   Customer Service Representative.     My core responsibility was simple: stand at a wicket and accept customer deposits, mainly from small   businesses, and pay out withdrawals, mainly to their employees. Over time, I got to know the regulars   ranging from the baker who would come in every afternoon to deposit a bundle of bank notes smelling of   bread (literally dough) to the executives of a failing construction company who would cash weekly their pay   cheques with alacrity and trepidation.     I learned that there were two types of client: those who engaged with me and those who didn�t. And I   learned with time that the former got more from the bank because I and it knew more about them and what   they needed � whether a savings product or a loan. The bank got more from them in terms of revenue and   reliability (helpful given that two small banks had recently failed). Indeed, as my province was in a deep   recession at the time, loyalty and understanding mattered. It could mean the difference between a   restructured loan that could be repaid and a foreclosure that would bring liquidation.     In short, I was at the front line of a banking value chain � one that is now being impacted across its   components by FinTech.     Traditional universal banks combine the customer relationship, retail and commercial deposits and lending,   and a wide range of activities in wholesale money and capital markets.     2    The FSB defines FinTech as technologically-enabled financial innovation that could result in new business models, applications,   processes or products with an associated material effect on financial markets and institutions and the provision of financial services.                                                                                                                                             4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                           4   Diagram A: Financial Services Value Chain       Payment services traditionally relied on cash, debit and credit cards, and wire transfers. Now FinTech   companies are providing domestic and cross-border payment services on significant scale through �digital   wallets� or pre-funded �eMoney�. Tech firms take a slice of payment revenues and, in many cases, the   totality of customer transaction data. In the process, they are systematically capturing the type of knowledge   I used to gain from my daily interactions with customers in the bank branch.     Some providers are leveraging this data to sell their customers non-bank products and services. This � and   the desire to avoid regulation � reduces their incentive to integrate upstream to conventional banking.     Traditional universal banking begins with the customer relationship � or what I used to have as a teller.   This historic preserve of established financial institutions is now being opened up. Aggregators, making use   of banks� Application Programme Interfaces (APIs), are providing customers with ready access to price                                                                                                                          3   comparison and switching services. New pro-competition policies are reinforcing this competition.   Meanwhile so-called �robo advisors� are deploying algorithms to deliver affordable investment advice to retail   customers.       3    The second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) will allow, conditional on FCA authorisation and customer authority, non-banks to   access customers� bank account data. In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority has required that the UK�s nine largest banks   adopt an open banking standard for APIs by early 2018.                                                                                                                                    5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                   5   As customers become more willing to delegate decision-making to machines, their funds and loans are being   better matched with the best rates from around the system. These flows could become seamless if public   policy initiatives and new technologies combine to create digital credentials that are universal, durable and               4   reliable.     Other FinTech players are increasing competition in retail and commercial banking by providing new   lending and borrowing platforms for retail and corporate customers.     In a number of G20 countries, new business models draw on big data and advanced analytics to tailor   products and services to customers and discipline credit underwriting. For example, peer-to-peer (�P2P�)                                                                                 5   lending has grown rapidly in recent years from a small base. In the UK, P2P lending now represents about   14% of the new lending to SMEs. Estimates suggest that more than half of these credits were unlikely to                                                    6   have been provided by existing banks. Other platforms are allowing firms to borrow against invoice   receivables, drawing on data gathered directly from software their customers use to manage their accounts   payable.     Some of the more radical innovations underway are in emerging economies. E-commerce platforms in   China, for example, are using algorithms to analyse transaction and search data to improve credit scoring.   The result has been a significant expansion of credit availability with low default rates (albeit ones not yet                                              7   tested by an economic downturn).     In wholesale banking and markets, the direction of travel over the past few years has been from   intermediated trading (involving �dealers�, either via voice or electronically) to non-intermediated, more fully                                          8   electronic order-driven trading. Where securities, such as equities and futures, are traded electronically,   including via exchanges, algorithmic trading has grown rapidly. Technological improvements, and the growth   of multilateral trading venues, led to the emergence of high-frequency trading firms. From a small base in   the early 2000s estimates now suggest they (High Frequency Traders) account for up to three-quarters of                                                               9   equity trading volumes and around 40% of FX.       4     For now, however, every regulated financial institution must separately meet legal and regulatory requirements to establish customer   identities. This adds cost and reduces choice, but safeguards privacy.   5     In 2015, total loans originated by peer-to-peer lenders were $117 billion in China, $40 billion in the US, �4.5 billion in the UK and �1.1   billion across Europe. At least in the UK, there are signs that the rate of growth for new lending has slowed recently; down from 100%   to 30%.   6     NESTA survey evidence suggests that around 55-60% of peer-to-peer business borrowers were refused bank credit while other SME   firms have assumed they would not be offered bank credit.   7     In 2014, only around 10% of Chinese adults accessed credit from a financial institution and less than one third have a credit score. A   number of organisations have been authorised by the government to provide alternative credit scores, including Ant Financial, which   since it launched in 2015 has amassed 190 million users and made more than 400 billion yuan of microloans. Although they require no   guarantee or collateral, default rates are currently reported to be less than 2%.   8     This shift has not been uniform, however. For example, while just over a third of US Treasuries are traded electronically, this figure is   much smaller for UK and German government bonds. And US corporate bonds are almost fully intermediated.   9     This was aided too when the NYSE, in 2001, reduced the minimum increment for trading in listed US equities to 1 cent from one   sixteenth of a US dollar.                                                                                                                                            6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                            6   Finally, technology promises changes to wholesale payment, clearing and settlement infrastructure.   Emerging technologies, such as distributed ledger, could in future offer significant gains in the accuracy,   efficiency and security of processes across payments, clearing and settlement as well as better regulatory   compliance. In the process, tens of billions of dollars of capital may be saved and resilience could be                               10   significantly improved.     Securities settlement in particular seems ripe for innovation; a typical settlement chain can involve many   intermediaries, making securities settlement comparatively slow, operational risks and costs high.          3. Broader Public Policy Issues     Before turning to some specific financial stability issues created by these developments, let me acknowledge   a few of the other important public policy considerations that G20 authorities must bear in mind �   not least because how they are addressed will influence the extent to which certain financial technologies   are adopted and the system is transformed.     First, a host of conduct issues with these new products and services, must be addressed including client   suitability, Anti-Money Laundering (�AML�) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (�CFT�). Conduct   regulators � such as the UK�s Financial Conduct Authority (�FCA�) � have taken an early lead in seeking to   ensure that standards for financial advice and services offered are upheld, and that the integrity of the   financial system is protected.     Second, the twin imperatives of greater inclusion and more competition point to the value of digital identities.                                                                                                                     11   Billions of people are still under-or unbanked across advanced and emerging economies.                                 And as the FSB   and others have highlighted, some countries are at risk of being cut off from the global financial system as                                                   12   major correspondent banks withdraw.     New technologies are providing solutions. Already, biometrics and cryptography are being used to validate   customer identities in consistent and reliable ways, facilitating access to the financial system and reducing   AML and CFT due diligence costs. For example, since 2010, the Indian government has issued more than   800 million such identities, such that at least four out of five citizens can now use them to make use of   governmental and financial services.       10      Oliver Wyman and Santander estimated that distributed ledger technology could reduce banks� infrastructure costs attributable to   cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance by $15-20bn per annum by 2022. See:   https://santanderinnoventures.com/fintech2/   11      Some 2 billion adults lack a bank account worldwide. 10 million US households and 1.5 million UK adults are also unbanked.   12      In recognition of the serious implications of a withdrawal in correspondent banking services for growth, financial inclusion, and the   stability and integrity of the financial system, the FSB is working to advance a four-point Action Plan to address the recent decline. For   an update on this work see: http://www.fsb.org/2016/12/fsb-publishes-progress-report-and-2017-workplan-to-assess-and-address-the-   decline-in-correspondent-banking/                                                                                                                                           7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                          7   Seizing this opportunity means considering fundamental rights such as privacy, and practical constraints   such as the costs of storage and handling. Ultimately it is for governments and citizens to decide whether �   and how � to ensure the benefits outweigh the costs.     Third, and relatedly, there are fundamental issues around data protection to consider. Traditionally, financial   institutions have sought to protect and use their own customers� data under well-established legal and   regulatory frameworks. In contrast, social media firms regularly collect and sometimes share extensive data                                                13   from their users (with their consent).            The FinTech future envisages the gathering of a broad range of   financial and non-financial data from, and sharing across, a wider set of parties. A more intense debate can   be expected about whether there are appropriate frameworks for the gathering, storing and sharing data   both domestically and cross-border.     Now turning to the most important financial stability risks.          4. The Potential Impact of FinTech on Financial Stability     As I mentioned earlier, the FSB is assessing how FinTech developments are affecting the resilience of the   system; by identifying the risks associated with new and existing financial institutions and activities, and the   supporting financial market infrastructure.     In so doing, the FSB is making use of its existing risk assessment frameworks for evaluating the systemic   risks around banks, insurers and financial market infrastructure, as well as activities beyond the regulated             14   sector.     Our starting point is that there is nothing new under the sun. We need to be disciplined about consistent   approaches to similar activities undertaken by different institutions that give rise to the same financial stability   risks. Just because something is new doesn�t necessarily mean it should be treated differently. Similarly,   just because it is outside the regulatory perimeter doesn�t necessarily mean it needs to be brought inside.       13      In today�s interconnected world, many citizens have authorised the use and onward sharing of their data without realising it. In   considering digital identities, there may be opportunity for citizens and their elected representatives to agree what arrangements should   be put in place to safeguard data, including who it could be shared with.   14      These frameworks provide methodologies for assessing the systemic importance of: financial institutions, markets and instruments   and of non-banks, non-insurers (NBNI); risks from shadow banking; and principles for Financial Market Infrastructure.                                                                                                                                        8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                         8   Some of the most important questions we are considering include:          -   Which FinTech activities constitute traditional banking activities by another name and should be            regulated as such? Those systemic risks associated with credit intermediation including maturity            transformation, leverage and liquidity mismatch should be regulated consistently regardless of the            delivery mechanism or credit algorithm (a general principle of the FSB�s shadow banking                         15            roadmap).          -   How could developments change the safety and soundness of existing regulated firms, particularly            those judged to be systemic, and what supervisory responses for those firms should be put into            place?          -   How could developments change potential macroeconomic and macrofinancial dynamics including            disruptions to systemically important markets?          -   What are the implications for the aggregate level of cyber and operational risk in the financial            system? And which FinTech activities could become systemic because they provide new critical            economic functions or market infrastructure (for example if certain digital wallets become dominant)            and potentially merit higher standards of operational risk oversight?     To illustrate some of the issues, let�s return to the financial services value chain to consider some of the   ways in which FinTech developments could affect financial stability.       15     See FSB, (2013), �Strengthening Oversight and Regulation of Shadow Banking, FSB, (2013). Available at: http://www.fsb.org/wp-   content/uploads/r_130829c.pdf                                                                                                                                     9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                   9   Diagram B: Financial Services Value Chain with Potential Issues for Financial Stability       Conduct regulators are in the lead in addressing regulatory issues posed by payment services                    16   innovations.          This is both because, at least in advanced economies, FinTech payment service providers   have not chosen to undertake banking activities and individual providers have not yet reached the scale that   might be considered systemic.     Looking ahead, it is possible that virtual currencies and FinTech-based providers, particularly where they   gain direct membership to central bank payment systems, could begin to displace traditional bank-based   payment services and systems. Such diversification could be positive for stability; after all the existing tiered   and highly concentrated system has created single point of failure risks. At the same time, regulators would   need to monitor such changes for any new concentrations.     In this regard, with a view to such future proofing, the Digital Economy Bill in the UK proposes to extend the   definition of a payment system beyond those that are inter-bank, to include any that become systemically                                                                                                             17   important. If these are so designated by HMT, they would be supervised by the Bank.                            This would be akin                                                                           18   to the recent recognition by HMT of Visa Europe and Link.       16        In the UK under eMoney regulations, providers must hold customer funds separately.   17      The legislative changes also include adding non-bank payment providers to the list of regulated entities to whom the Settlement   Finality Regulations apply and modifying the Payment Services and Electronic Money Regulations to enable safeguarded funds held by   E-Money Institutions and Payment Institutions to be posted with the Bank.   18      These systems were brought within the Bank�s supervision, under Banking Act 2009 powers, because of the potential they have to   threaten the stability of, or confidence in, the UK�s financial system or to have serious consequences for business or other interests   throughout the UK in the event of their disruption.                                                                                                                                      10     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                      10   Changes to payments and customer relationships may have more fundamental implications for financial   stability.     Specifically, while FinTech may make conventional banking more contestable, improving efficiency and   customer choice, the opening up of the customer interface and payment services business, could, in time,   signal the end of universal banking as we know it. If today�s universal banks have less stable retail funding   and weaker, more arms-length client relationships, the volatility of their deposits and liquidity risk could   increase. In addition, with weaker customer ties, cross-selling (my old preserve as a teller) could be less   prevalent, hitting profitability. The system as a whole wouldn�t necessarily be riskier, but prudential   standards and resolution regimes for banks may need to be adjusted.     The diversity in funding brought by market-based finance, as an alternative to retail banking, means that   peer-to-peer lending has potential to provide some consumers and small businesses with affordable credit,   when retail banks cannot. At the same time, this implies that borrowers in some segments may be placing   increased reliance on this source of funding. How stable this funding will prove through-the-cycle is not yet   clear, as the sector�s underwriting standards, and lenders� tolerance to losses, have not been tested by a   downturn.     Due to its small scale and business models, the P2P lending sector does not, for now, appear to pose   material systemic risks. That said, as a general rule, it always pays to monitor closely fast-growing sources   of credit for slippages in underwriting standards and the promotion of excessive borrowing. Moreover, it is   not clear the extent to which P2P lending can grow without business models evolving in ways that introduce   conventional risks, including maturity transformation, leverage and liquidity mismatch, or through the use of   originate and distribute models such as those seen in securitisation in the 2000s. Were these changes to   occur, regulators would be expected to address such emerging vulnerabilities.     In wholesale banking and markets, robo-advice and risk management algorithms may lead to excess   volatility or increase pro-cyclicality as a result of herding, particularly if the underlying algorithms are overly   sensitive to price movements or highly correlated. Similarly, although algorithmic traders have become a   more important source of market liquidity in many important financial markets, they tend to be more active   during periods of low volatility giving an illusion of plentiful liquidity that may subsequently be withdrawn   during periods of market disruption when it is needed most.     FinTech innovations, such as distributed ledgers, are being trialled for use within, or as a substitute to,   existing wholesale payment, clearing and settlement infrastructure, will need to meet the highest   standards of resilience, reliability, privacy and scalability.                                                                                                                             11     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                        11   For all financial firms, the advent of FinTech materially changes operational and cyber risks. Regulators   need to be alert to new single point of failure risks such as if banks come to rely on common hosts of online   banking or providers of cloud computing services.     In recent years, the cyber threat to the system has grown as financial institutions have become more reliant   on interconnected IT systems. As the FinTech future envisages the sharing of data across a wider set of   parties, coupled with greater speed and automaticity in executing transactions, the challenges around   protecting data and the integrity of the system are likely to increase. One sign of this is a growing   preoccupation in the insurance industry with how best to underwrite such risks.     Recognising the vital importance of learning from international experience, in late 2016 the G20 called upon   the FSB to stock-take existing cyber security regulation, as a basis for developing best practices in the                       19   medium-term.            5. Conclusion     In conclusion, FinTech appears to be everywhere. Media citations � and conferences � are through the roof.

2017-02-15	"Reflecting diversity, choosing inclusion   Speech given by   Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England       Court Room, Bank of England   9 February 2017       I am grateful to Jennifer Nemeth, Anne Wetherilt and Iain de Weymarn for their assistance in   preparing these remarks, and to Richard Galletly, Cat Hines and Daniel Nixon for background   research.                                                                                                   1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches   And there were never, in the world, two opinions alike, no more than two hairs, or two grains; their most   universal quality is diversity.     (Michel de Montaigne, Essais, Book II, Chapter 37)     Introduction     The Bank of England recognises that to pursue its mission it must reflect the diversity of the people it serves.   That has not always been the case. Historically, there were times when this institution was run by the City   for the City. Our first female Court member, Frances Heaton was only appointed in 1993, while our first   Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) member, Lord Morris, followed five years later. Ten years ago our                                                                                th   graduate intake was drawn from just 11 universities. And I am the 120 in a very long line of male   Governors of the Bank.     Frequent charges levelled at this central bank � like many of our peers � include being mono-culture,   secretive and ridden with groupthink.     Those charges began to lose their force in the face of significant efforts by my predecessors. But despite   that progress, when the Bank was reunited with the PRA we knew that we still had to do much, much more.   So three years ago we made Diverse and Talented a central pillar of our first strategic plan. We value   diversity for at least three reasons. First, it is the right thing to do; a public institution should seek to reflect                                                                                               i   the public it serves. Second, it helps to build the trust we need to deliver our remits. Third, it is well   established that diversity leads to more creative thinking and reduces the risks of groupthink and bias.   It isn�t enough for us to reflect diversity, however; we need also to choose inclusiveness. Inclusiveness   unlocks the true value of an organisation�s diversity; through inclusion people can realise their full potential.   That�s why as we increase the diversity of the Bank, we are focussing on building a culture that values   diverse ideas, encourages open debate, and empowers people at all levels to take initiative.   Since these two ideals go hand in hand, today I will reflect on both diversity and inclusion: what they mean,   why they matter, and how they are best delivered in a modern central bank.     The what     There are two main types of diversity � identity and cognitive.     Gender, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation, education are all identity factors, which can be                                                       ii   measured, targeted and their impact assessed. As I will discuss in a moment, we have introduced diversity   targets for the first time.                                                                                                                               2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                         2   The Bank is also seeking to increase our cognitive diversity, which shapes our perspectives � how we think                                         iii   about problems and solve them                                                                                      iv   Cognitive diversity doesn�t lend itself to targets. But it�s no less important.        Research shows that while older   colleagues often view diversity as an issue of representation and fairness, millennials tend to view cognitive                                                                     v   diversity as essential for a diverse and inclusive organisation. This younger generation is interested in   connecting with each other, collaborating across teams and exploring a variety of ideas to solve problems.   That�s not just interesting, it�s necessary. The spirit of the millennial is better suited to the complex   challenges that central bankers face in a risky and uncertain world.     So our commitment to diversity cannot only be about meeting targets. It must promote an environment that   brings cognitive differences to the fore, and it must create a culture where everyone can maximise their   potential. We need a richness of ideas and perspectives that are exchanged in the pursuit of clear goals   under an overarching mission. This is the crux of inclusion: an organisation where people feel empowered,   enabled and engaged in pursuit of a common goal.     The why     Increased trust     As a central bank, we need to be understood, credible and trusted for our policies to be most effective.   The Bank�s work often requires deep technical skill and knowledge. Not everyone wants to be steeped in fan   charts; modelling and stress testing. Yet the decisions we take impact every UK citizen. How can they rely on   us � the dreaded experts?     Of course, trust can be built through a track record, but it can also be grounded in familiarity. People trust                                                      vi   individuals, places and things that they know. Reflecting the diversity of the people we serve can reduce   misperceptions that we are experts making esoteric decisions in an ivory tower for the benefit of others.     Moreover, diverse decision-making bodies typically have greater political support and enjoy greater public            vii   trust.         They also tend to achieve better policy outcomes through better understanding of community needs                                                              viii   and more effective dialogue with the wider population.     Better decision making, innovation and adaptability     Homogenous groups that pay insufficient attention to minority views are vulnerable to biases, groupthink and   over optimism. They are more likely to be influenced by the way information is presented (framing); and to                                                                          ix   stick with under-performing projects because of prior investments.                                                                                                                          3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                      3   Diverse groups can overcome these ills as they are more inclined to consider novel ideas and challenge                                                                                           x, xi   each other, enabling them to infer cause and effect and to solve problems better.                                                                                     xii   Diverse teams are also better able to adapt to changes and are more resilient.          This is particularly   important in a rapidly changing world, where information is super abundant and certainty is absent.     Indeed, almost all decisions in finance are taken under uncertainty. This makes it especially important that   decision makers are exposed to a range of views, with open debate that includes perspectives that challenge   the prevailing wisdom.     For those central banks with regulatory responsibilities, biases in supervision can be countered by                                                                                                   xiii   considering a variety of perspectives and debating within diverse supervisory teams.     Diversity must be supported by the right structures for its benefits to be realised. For example, research on   central bank committee design shows how diverse decision making benefits from:     ?   Having a clearly defined policy objective;   ?   Having relatively small policy committees, with external members;   ?                                                                                                            xiv       Publishing policy decisions, and allowing for external scrutiny of decision-making processes.     These features are integral to the MPC, FPC, PRA Board and Court of the Bank of England. In recent years,   we have reinforced them by implementing the recommendations of the Warsh review, including publishing   transcripts and putting all policy committees on an equal footing with clear remits.     More effective communication     Being diverse can help us to craft communications that people can actually understand.   The past few decades have seen enormous strides in central bank transparency � minutes are published,   interviews given, speeches rendered, blogs posted. Now it is high time that greater emphasis is placed on   how central banks communicate.                                                                                                                   xv   Increasingly we are asking ourselves whether we are communicating messages in accessible language.   Whether we�re using the right media channels to reach the widest possible audience. And most   fundamentally, whether people from different backgrounds deduce the same things from our policy   messages.     Diversity can help. The more homogenous an organisation the more likely it will fall foul of the �curse of   knowledge.� This cognitive bias occurs when people assume that their audience has the same background                                                                xvi   information and base level of understanding as themselves.         It�s assuming that everyone has the same   narrow view of humanity as the representative agent at the heart of a DSGE model.                                                                                                                        4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                     4   To communicate to both the City and the country, the salon and the suburb, we need to create content that   engages different audiences. The problem is that they don�t teach you this in Grad school (or at least the   ones where we traditionally recruited). We need alternative perspectives to craft our messages so that they   make sense and resonate with more people.     The more people can recognise themselves in us, the more we can stand in their shoes and speak their                                                          xvii   language, the more likely the Bank is to be trusted.     The how     The Bank�s approach to increase diversity and foster inclusion is three-fold:   ?   through inclusive recruitment,   ?    developing an inclusive culture, and   ?   creating inclusive communications.     Inclusive recruitment     To support our objectives, we have introduced diversity targets that are reviewed and challenged by Court.   Specifically, we aim to triple both the proportions of women in our senior roles, to 35% by 2020, and of   BAME employees in these roles to 13% by 2022.                                                                                                   xviii   As a first step, we are fishing from a larger pond and removing perceived barriers to entry.           We want to   make the Bank a more obvious career destination for a wide range recruits: young school leavers who want   to develop their skills as apprentices to graduates looking for their first full-time job, people who wish to   return to work, or experienced professionals who are considering a career change and want to contribute to   public policy.     In our last graduate round, we hired from over 40 UK universities (four times as many as a decade ago),   attracting students from a range of socio-economic backgrounds. Two fifths of the 2016 intake were female   and a quarter came from a BAME background. Only half studied economics. The remainder were plucked   equally from the sciences, business and the humanities.     15% of our graduates were hired from Oxbridge, and a fifth were from lower socio-economic backgrounds. In   contrast, 21% of fast track hires to public service are from Oxbridge and only 4% are from lower                                  xix   socio-economic backgrounds.     While we are casting a wider net, the reality is, the nature of our work means that we will always need to hire   technical experts. Unfortunately, there continues to be limited diversity in both US and UK economics                                                                                                                          5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                     5                                                                         xx   departments, which to some degree, constrains whom we can hire . Both the education sector and the Bank                                         xxi   need to do more to broaden access.     One new initiative that enables the Bank to hire graduates from a broader set of disciplines and train them as   economists and technical specialists is our new Central Bank Qualification. Similarly, our African-Caribbean   scholarship aims to attract those hitherto underrepresented in central banking. Launched in 2015, the   scholarship has given three students per year �30,000 toward living and study costs, offered summer   internships and provided career mentors.     To recruit experienced hires, we have committed to ensure that wherever possible, we will create diverse   shortlists for jobs and interview people with diverse panels in order to mitigate affinity effects and   unconscious biases. This is starting to pay off. Of the 700 experienced professionals we hired last year,   almost half were women and a quarter came from a BAME background, up from two-fifths and one fifth   respectively since our strategic plan was launched. In recent years, we have recruited new PhD students not   just from economics, but from physics, computer science, linguistics, psychology, anthropology and   economic history.     We recognise that career paths can be varied, so for people who want to return to work or to retrain, we are   offering more opportunities to learn. Around 200 of our colleagues studied for degrees or professional   qualifications in 2016 and 670 re-skilled through internal job moves across directorates. And since new skills   can also be acquired outside the day job, we are increasing our support for community volunteering and   engagement.     We are encouraged that at the last count, over three quarters of our staff believe that the Bank offers good   opportunities for learning and development. That�s a six percentage point improvement on the previous year                                                 xxii   and 20 percent higher than the UK average.     We can�t take this progress for granted, however, and need to redouble our efforts to build a more inclusive   culture at the Bank.     Inclusive culture     Having attracted a diverse workforce, we must enable and encourage participation. We are striving to create   a more inclusive environment where different working patterns are accommodated, people can debate,   challenge and present ideas, and are supported when undertaking new and innovative work. Inclusion   Fortnight, with 21 events over ten days across three sites, attended by almost 1700 people is the latest   example of this commitment.                                                                                                                      6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                6   An inclusive culture is essential to realise the benefits of our aim to be �One Bank�. We are working to create   a more agile work environment, which encourages cross-disciplinary and cross-team working further   supporting the development of new ideas and approaches.     We are encouraging innovative thinking through our Research Hub, where people have collaborated with   colleagues across the Bank and externally on over 50 projects. Meanwhile, our Research Away Days and   One Bank Flagship Seminar series expose policy and decision makers to different ideas; from sportspersons   to philosophers, and economists to psychologists. Our seminars are broadcast externally so that others can   benefit from this diverse knowledge.     To empower colleagues, we have implemented an �author in the room� policy so that expert staff can attend   senior-level meetings and explain their papers in person and challenge conventional wisdom.     Our Bank Underground blog, launched in 2015, enables colleagues to share their diverse opinions outside   the Bank�s four walls. 400,000 people viewed the blog last year. Over the same period, its followers and   subscribers increased by 60%.     Our staff are reaping the benefits of these inclusion and transparency initiatives. Two thirds feel encouraged   to try new ideas, three quarters believe that their manager acts on people�s suggestions and ideas, and 60%   feel comfortable speaking up on important issues. We have improved on all of these measures since just a               xxiii   year ago.           But we also need to do more.     To get the most out of a diverse workforce, we also need to ensure people can bring their best to work and   feel supported. Our wellbeing programme promotes mental and physical wellbeing with staff counsellors,   discounted gym-memberships, a Cycle to Work scheme, working life seminars and flexible leave options.   An inclusive culture recognises that work can be done in many ways; and that our best ideas can occur at                                    xxiv   any time and in any place.              11% of our staff are employed on a formalised flexible working arrangement,   including remote working. In our most recent survey, two thirds of people agreed that there was a good   balance between their work and their personal life.     Our broader leadership training programme emphasises unconscious bias training to ensure diversity can   flourish and progress. This training is part of our broader focus on values. Values count heavily when   assessing performance and reward. All managers - including myself - are assessed by colleagues on their   values and behaviours.       The Employee Network Groups support colleagues in the Bank to be themselves and connect with different   aspects of their lives. They bring issues to the attention of the Bank�s senior team and they hold us to   account, raise awareness of different cultures and causes, and educate us to work against any biases. For                                                                                                                          7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                       7   example, the disability network has played a huge part in our efforts to make the building more accessible,   the women�s network was heavily involved when we developed our flexible working propositions and the   Bank�s ethnic minorities network has launched a reciprocal mentoring scheme to support career   development.     Inclusive communications     Diversity also means engaging with all our stakeholders, internal and external, and being aware of the many   ways in which the economic situation affects different people. Active engagement between Bank officials and   a range of expert and non-expert stakeholders across the UK has always been important, but it is taking on   new prominence in the information age.     Our agents and Bank officials meet thousands of business contacts across the UK each year to take the   temperature of the UK economy.     Our new Open Forum and Future Forum events do this on a large scale by bringing together thousands of   people from the community to discuss the economy, the financial system and the Bank�s role in promoting   the good of the people of the United Kingdom. We listen to the views and concerns of local business   leaders, technology developers, representatives from the voluntary and education sectors, unions and the   wider public and explore how the Bank can maintain stability and reduce uncertainty. The 2015 Open Forum   event attracted 10,000 webpage views, 11,000 playbacks of our YouTube content and 3,000 tweets, while   our 2016 Future Forum event saw almost 140,000 twitter impressions.     In reality, we can�t always be there face to face. And this requires more tailored content. Deploying social   media, including Facebook and YouTube, delivers our messages directly to a broader audience. New digital   products, such as KnowledgeBank, use accessible language and engaging visuals to help us tell a story   about what the Bank does. Our recently created visual summary of the Financial Stability Report, explained   how risks in both the UK and the global environment may affect financial stability without the need for dense   text.     Conclusion     Our staff survey last year showed that almost 80% of staff felt that the Bank takes diversity seriously, and   90% of people felt respected. Our direction of travel is encouraging, but we are far from satisfied. To take this   to the next level, we have two priorities.    First, we need to do more to change the way that we work. To maximise the potential of our people, the Bank   needs to embrace fully collaborative working in diverse teams. We have an incredible endowment of skills   and experience. We maximise our impact when we get together - across disciplines and across                                                                                                                    8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                 8   areas. Everyone in the Bank should be able to devote some proportion of their time to such cross-cutting   work.    Second, we need to make our communications more inclusive. Everyone, every day in the Bank will benefit   if our thinking tailored to its audience. This also means making the Bank more permeable, so that internal   analysis can be more readily lifted and shared with others. And it means considering what we communicate,   through which channels and to whom.    Just as having a diverse and talented workforce has been a central pillar of our current strategic plan these   priorities will be platforms of our next one. They will help us build the trust that is crucial to delivering our   mission. And they will help us merit that trust by making us more effective. By reflecting diversity and   choosing inclusion, we will ensure we are doing all that we can to promote the good of the people of the   United Kingdom.                                                                                                                           9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                     9   ENDNOTES    i       Putnam, R (1993), �What makes democracy work?� National Civic Review.

2017-03-22	"Remarks at the Banking Standards Board Panel �Worthy of   trust? Law, ethics and culture in banking�     Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England       Bank of England Conference Centre   21 March 2017                                                                             1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches   It is a pleasure to host this Banking Standards Board event �Worthy of trust? Law, ethics and culture in   banking� and to join this distinguished panel.     Over the past decade, banking has suffered twin crises of solvency and legitimacy.     The first is being addressed by comprehensive reforms. As a consequence, large banks are now stronger,                                          1   more liquid, and more focused.     This immense progress has been overshadowed by a crisis of legitimacy. A series of scandals ranging from   mis-selling to manipulation have undermined trust in banking, the financial system, and, to some degree,   markets themselves.                                                                    2   Multiple factors contributed to a tide of ethical drift. Market standards were poorly understood, often ignored   and lacked teeth. Too many participants neither felt responsible for the system nor recognised the full impact   of their actions. Bad behaviour went unchecked, proliferated and eventually became the norm.     The economic consequences have been enormous. Global banks� misconduct costs have now reached over   $320 billion � capital that could otherwise have supported up to $5 trillion of lending to households and                  3   businesses.     But there is a bigger cost.     An industry the scale and importance of finance needs social capital as well as economic capital. It requires   the consent of society in order to operate, innovate and grow.     Repeated episodes of misconduct have called the social licence of finance into question.     In a system where trust is fundamental it ought to be of grave concern that only 20% of UK citizens now think                                                                             4   that banks are well-run, down from 90% in the late 1980s.       1     For example, their capital requirements have increased 10-fold. And in response these banks have raised over $1.5 trillion of capital in   recent years.   2     There are multiple root causes: (i) market structures presented opportunities for abuse and were vulnerable to conflicts of interest and   collusion; (ii) systems of internal governance and controls were incapable of asserting the interests of firms � and society � over those of   staff; (iii) compensation packages rewarded short-term returns and ignored long-term value creation and good conduct; (iv) and dearth   of personal accountability.   3     For misconduct costs see BCG report, �Global Risk 2017: Staying the Course in Banking, March 2017   http://www.bcg.com/publications/2017/financial-institutions-growth-global-risk-2017-staying-course-banking.aspx. Estimates of the   impact on lending capacity are Bank of England calculations.   4     British Social Attitudes Survey (2013).                                                                                                                                           2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                            2   From ethical drift to ethical lift     The scale of these shortcomings is why the Bank of England has been pursuing a series of measures to   convert ethical drift into ethical lift. Domestically we are working closely with the Financial Conduct   Authority (FCA) and HM Treasury. Internationally, we have catalysed a series of actions at the Financial   Stability Board (FSB) that will be presented to the G20 Leaders� Summit in July.     Allow me to review the main elements before concentrating on how codes of conduct and the Senior   Managers Regime (SMR) can lift standards and improve culture.     Let me be clear at the outset that the Bank of England holds itself to the highest standards. In that spirit, I   will extend my remarks to review some lessons the Bank can learn from the events surrounding Charlotte   Hogg�s resignation, and the steps we are taking in response.     The UK Action Plan to improve conduct     Our action plan for the financial system begins with stronger deterrents. In the UK, important steps have                                                                                                                                  5   been taken to strengthen laws and regulations, though some gaps remain, most notably in the FX market.   But authorities cannot and should not try to legislate for every circumstance, watch every transaction, or   anticipate every market innovation. So while fines and sanctions have roles in deterring misconduct, they   will not, on their own, bring about the cultural change we need.     We must move from an excessive reliance on punitive, ex post fines of firms to greater emphasis on more   compelling ex ante incentives for individuals, and ultimately a more solid grounding in improved firm culture.     This includes reducing opportunities for bad behaviour, for example, by overhauling the regulation of key   benchmarks in FICC markets.     More fundamentally, it requires compensation rules that align better risk and reward. In the UK a significant   proportion of variable compensation now must be deferred for a period of seven years. This ensures that it   can be clawed back over the time scales it generally takes for conduct issues to come to light.     To address the �rolling bad apples� problem, mechanisms are now in place in the UK to ensure that when                                                                                                     6   individuals move on their history will be known to those who consider hiring them. The FSB is now                                                                             7   considering whether to adopt such an approach more broadly.     5     The UK�s Fair and Effective Markets Review (FEMR) recommended that the EU�s market abuse regulation should be extended to   cover every major fixed income and currency market, that criminal sanctions be updated, and maximum prison terms extended. See:   http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/Pages/fmreview.aspx   6     The PRA has introduced requirements for regulated firms to provide employment references to one another in a mandatory template   when hiring Senior Managers. This includes information on an individual�s conduct record, and their fitness and propriety.                                                                                                                                   3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                 3   This is all constructive but insufficient. That�s why we have emphasised measures to ensure firms and their   employees take responsibility � individually and collectively � for their own conduct. These range from   securing compliance with minimum standards to a common and dynamic understanding of good practice that   is widely understood and collectively enforced.     UK authorities have used their convening powers to encourage market participants to establish standards of   market practice that are well understood, widely followed and, crucially, that keep pace with market   developments.     This is what the Banking Standards Board is doing by promoting higher standards of conduct and   competence across the UK banking system. It�s why the global FICC Market Standards Board (FMSB) is   establishing readily understood standards for their markets. And it�s why the FX Committees will launch in   May the first globally consistent code of conduct for FX markets.     But codes are of little use if nobody reads, follows, or enforces them. This is where the UK�s Senior   Managers Regime comes in.     Senior Managers Regime     The SMR addresses the common refrain of senior management that they weren�t aware that misconduct was   taking place in their firms. The SMR sets a series of requirements for the most senior decision-makers of   banks, building societies and major investment firms.     The SMR re-establishes the link between seniority and accountability. Senior Managers are now held   accountable if they fail to take reasonable steps (including training or proper oversight) to prevent or stop                                                                8   regulatory breaches in their areas of responsibility.     And the SMR prescribes responsibilities � typically to the Chair and CEO respectively � for developing and   embedding a firm�s culture.     Under the related Certification Regime, firms must also annually assess and certify the fitness and propriety   of a wide range of risk-taking employees.     Although the SMR is only a year old and we are all learning by doing, there are encouraging signs that it is   making a difference.      7     See FSB press release at: http://www.fsb.org/2017/02/fsb-assesses-implementation-progress-and-effects-of-reforms/. Additionally see   FSB �Stocktake of efforts to strengthen governance frameworks to mitigate misconduct risks�, forthcoming March 2017.   8     The SMR came into effect on 7 March 2016. Insurers are required to meet similar standards under Solvency II and in future, the SMR   will apply to them directly, as it will to other participants in FICC markets.                                                                                                                                     4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                     4   For firms, the SMR is clarifying and improving governance, accountability and decision-making processes.   Senior Managers are increasingly focusing on building cultures of risk awareness, openness and ethical                                                                                                                                       9   behaviour. In the words of one chairman �responsibility for culture has moved to the top of my agenda.�     For supervisors, the regime is helping identify weaknesses in governance and accountability, and   encouraging the necessary changes. This is particularly true in cases where authority has historically been   blurred such as in cross-border banking.     Adoption is spreading. Some international firms are voluntarily adopting elements of the SMR�s certification   requirements to strengthen their global operations. And the FSB is now explicitly reviewing the merits of                                         10   such �responsibility mapping�.     Recent events                                                                              11   The SMR has also been adopted by the Bank of England.                          We chose to because our mission demands that   we hold ourselves to the highest standards of governance and accountability.     One of our colleagues did not meet these high standards recently. Our newly appointed Deputy Governor   for Markets and Banking, Charlotte Hogg had previously not disclosed a relevant family relationship, as was   required under our staff Code of Conduct.     For those who have questioned whether we �get it�, we do. We know this honest mistake was also a serious   mistake � one that was compounded by the fact that Charlotte Hogg had overseen the development of our   new Code.     We were clear upfront that there must be consequences for both her and the Bank.     Our minimum response would obviously be what we would expect to see in the firms that we supervise.   Let�s be absolutely clear about this baseline. In analogous situations in the private sector, we expect:         ?    Evidence that the firm is taking the matter seriously;        ?    Proportionate consequences for the individual, including some form of disciplinary warning and             possibly some impact on remuneration; and        ?    A wider review of lessons learned if there was any evidence that there was a systemic problem.       9     See page 16, Financial Reporting Council (FRC), �Corporate Culture and the Role of Boards: Report of observations�, July 2016.   10      See Footnote 7 for details.   11     With appropriate modifications to reflect the fact that it has a very different range of functions to a commercial bank and is accountable   to a different range of stakeholders, including Parliament.

She was formally warned in the strongest � and most public � of terms.          ?    There were consequences for her compensation. While she couldn�t forfeit a bonus as Bank of               England Governors cannot receive one, she waived her salary increase this year.          ?    Court reassigned her COO responsibilities.          ?    Court reconfigured reporting lines and internal structures in order to improve governance,               compliance and disciplinary processes, including reassigning the SMR responsibility for               implementing our Code.          ?    And, on the basis of this one incident, the independent directors of Court have initiated a widespread               review that will draw on the expertise of the Independent Evaluation Office, Internal Audit and the               National Audit Office. Its results will be made public.    In other words, consistent with our higher standards, the Bank planned a tougher response than we would   expect in the private sector, but one that, in our judgement, was still proportionate to an honest mistake that   was freely and transparently admitted.     The Treasury Select Committee (TSC) reached its own judgement, which in turn triggered Charlotte Hogg�s                           12   decision to resign.          I fully respect both the TSC�s judgement and her decision.     I wanted to speak to this, not to continue the debate about the rights and wrongs of this case, but instead to   highlight some of the lessons that the Bank and industry might draw from it.     In particular, I want to dispel the urban myth that has developed around these events. While the Prudential   Regulation Authority (PRA) can impose financial penalties and suspension under the SMR, we do not run for   our regulated entities a disproportionate �one strike and you are out� regime for an honest mistake. Neither   explicitly nor implicitly. Not I as Governor, not the CEO of the PRA, not the head of the FCA. Not any of our   supervisors in the PRA.     The SMR is about clear responsibilities, proportionate consequences, and developing a culture of openness   and accountability.     Proportionate means taking into account the severity of the incident, the track record of the individual and   their firm, as well as the firm�s wider response. An honest mistake that is freely admitted for which a firm   takes prompt remedial action is not a firing offence.     And here�s my point: we must not let recent events inadvertently tighten perceived standards for the industry   because that could have Senior Managers running scared, drive compliance underground and undermine    12        For TSC report see: https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmtreasy/.../1092.pdf                                                                                                                      6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                   6   our collective objectives. Another risk, flagged by some, is that it will also become harder to find candidates   of sufficient calibre willing to take on senior roles.     This is why last week I spoke with the CEOs or Chairs of all of the major banks to reiterate our expectations   as regulator. I�m glad I did because they were all concerned about precisely such unintended consequences.     The best in the industry are committed to making the SMR work � not because they have to � but because a   regime with clear responsibilities, proportionate consequences and a culture of openness helps to build the   culture that will over time help regain trust for the industry.     Conclusion     Changes to incentives, new codes and a clearer mapping of responsibilities will all help improve conduct and   lay the groundwork for better culture.     Of course, integrity can neither be bought nor regulated. Even with the best possible framework of codes and   principles, the soundest compensation schemes, and the most committed efforts to improve transparency,   financiers � in both the public and private sectors - must consistently challenge themselves and the   standards they uphold.     We are seeking to raise expectations and norms by using a combination of hard and soft law, with much of   the latter developed by the private sector. The best view finance as a profession with a purpose to serve their   clients. They see themselves as custodians of their institutions, with a sense of responsibility for the system.     Cultural change takes time. We know this from our own efforts. We have made great strides under our �One   Bank� strategic plan. Two-thirds of staff now feel encouraged to try new ideas, three-quarters indicate that   their managers act on their suggestions, and 60% are comfortable speaking up on an important issue. All of                                                                                   13   these metrics have significantly improved in the past few years.     We have comprehensively overhauled our governance, openness and accountability in recent years.     With the arrival of Anthony Habgood as Chair, Court has been strengthened and now acts as a unitary board   and meets the best practice found in the private sector. Its independent members now have more tangible   influence on the Bank, including through formal powers to observe the meetings of the Bank�s policy   committees and to commission independent reviews into the Bank�s performance. Its minutes are now   published after a lag of six weeks rather than a hundred years. It regularly releases reports on matters of       13        �Reflecting diversity, choosing inclusion� speech given by Mark Carney, 9 February 2017                                                                                                                  7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                7   concern ranging from policy, such as economic forecasting, to conduct, such as the Grabiner report into the                14   FX market.     We know we have more to do.     That�s why the independent non-executive directors are reviewing the Bank�s response to recent events.     That�s why our next strategic plan will focus to even greater degree on changing how we work. To maximise   the potential of our people, the Bank needs to embrace fully collaborative working in diverse teams that value   robust debate.     And it will focus on improving how we communicate, both internally and externally. We want all our   colleagues to feel empowered to raise issues promptly, to challenge and to voice any concerns they have.     These initiatives will help us build the trust that is crucial to delivering our mission. And they will help us merit   that trust by making us more effective.     The Bank will learn the lessons of these unfortunate events and apply those lessons to reinforce what�s best   in banking and the Bank of England.       14     For details of recent Court reports see: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/Pages/ieo/default.aspx.

2017-04-20	"The high road to a responsible, open financial system   Speech given by   Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England       Thomson Reuters, Canary Wharf   Friday 7 April 2017       I am grateful to Lauren Anderson, Phil Evans, Michael Goldby, Clare Macallan and Iain de Weymarn,   for their assistance in preparing these remarks.                                                    1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches   I.        Introduction    The United Kingdom has been at the heart of the global economy for centuries. Throughout that period, the   City has channelled the life blood of the world economy, finance.                                                                                                 th   London emerged as the world�s leading financial centre at the end of the 18 century, overtaking                                                                       1   Amsterdam, as Britain became the dominant economy. Whereas other major financial centres lost their   importance as economic power shifted elsewhere, London has retained its pre-eminence even as the UK�s                                                   2   relative economic weight has declined.     This staying power reflects London�s inherent strengths: its people, law, language and time zone. And it   testifies to the City�s enduring commitments to markets, openness and innovation.     Long experience teaches that an open global economy is not predestined. A responsible international   financial system requires:          -    a shared commitment to markets;        -    common minimum standards;        -    high degrees of cooperation amongst regulators; and        -    resilient institutions and markets at the core.     Authorities who oversee the largest global financial hubs, like the Bank of England, bear special   responsibilities. The Bank�s primary one is, of course, to ensure that the UK financial system serves UK   households and businesses. This includes protecting the UK real economy from being sideswiped by global   developments. As much as possible, we must do so in a manner that keeps cross-border markets open.   When these responsibilities come into conflict, we have to work with others to build resilience at home and   abroad in the most efficient and cooperative way possible.     The pillars of responsible financial globalisation eroded prior to the global financial crisis. Regulation   became light touch and ineffective. Looming risks in the financial system were ignored. Markets were fragile   and unfair, plagued by numerous instances of misconduct and limited market discipline on large firms. And   few participants were exposed to the full consequences of their actions as governance and compensation   arrangements focused on the short term.       1    For example, Britain accounted for nearly 20% of the world�s manufacturing by the mid-19th century.   2    At the end of the 19th Century, the UK accounted for as much as a quarter of world trade and produced around a tenth of global GDP.   Today, those shares have both fallen under 5%. For details on how the historical estimates are calculated, see �The UK at the heart of   a renewed globalisation�, speech given by Mark Carney, 24 October 2013, available at   http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2013/speech690.pdf.                                                                                                                                       2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                      2   The resulting cost to our citizens has been tremendous. Over the past decade, UK average real earnings                                                                     th   have fallen for the first time since the middle of the 19 century. Trust in the financial system has                 3   plummeted.     Over the past decade, the UK and its key G20 partners have been fixing these fault lines and creating a   system that is safer, simpler and fairer.     The system is safer because banks are now much more resilient, with capital requirements for the largest   global banks that are ten times higher than before the crisis and a new leverage ratio that guards against   risks that may seem low but prove not.     The financial system is simpler. As banks have become less complex and more focused, they are lending   more to households and businesses and less to each other. A series of measures are eliminating toxic and   fragile forms of shadow banking while reinforcing the best of resilient market-based finance. And more   durable market infrastructure is simplifying the previously complex � and dangerous � web of exposures in   derivative markets.     The financial system is fairer because of reforms that are ending the era of �too big to fail� banks and   addressing the root causes of a torrent of misconduct.     The benefits of these painstaking efforts are beginning to be realised. The global financial system is moving   from fragility to resilience. The too-big-to-fail public subsidy enjoyed by private systemic banks has fallen by   90% in the UK. Credit is now growing in all major economies. Sources of finance are increasingly diversified   between banks and markets, helping to keep the cost of finance low. And the system is demonstrating an   ability to dampen shocks rather than amplify them.     Despite this transformation, there are nascent risks that, if left unchecked, could reverse the progress made   and ultimately undermine the G20�s objective of strong, stable and balanced growth.     Indeed, the global financial system is at a fork in the road. On one path, we can build a more effective,   resilient system on the new pillars of responsible financial globalisation. On the other, countries could turn   inwards and reduce reliance on each other�s financial systems. That would, in turn, fragment pools of   funding and liquidity, reduce competition and impede cross-border investment. The net result would be less   reliable and more expensive financing for households and businesses, and very likely lower growth and   higher risks in all our economies.       3     The British Social Attitudes Survey (2013) reported that only 20% of UK citizens now think banks are well-run, down from 90% in the   late 1980s.                                                                                                                                       3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                     3   The outcome of the Brexit negotiations could prove highly influential in determining which path the global   financial system takes.     In that context, and fully consistent with the priorities of Her Majesty�s government, the Bank of England will   work to build a responsible financial globalisation that first protects and serves the UK real economy, and   then secures the UK�s traditional role of supporting global prosperity through an open global economy.     II.       The UK Financial System is a National Asset and a Global Public Good                                                                                        4   Having a large financial sector brings substantial benefits to the UK.     Financial services accounts for 7% of output and is a source of over 1 million jobs, two thirds of which are                                                                                                    5   outside London. It contributes around �70bn, or 11%, of annual tax revenues.     Financial services are the UK�s most important exports, running a trade surplus of around �60bn or 3% of   GDP. The rest of the economy runs a deficit almost twice as large.     Being at the heart of the global financial system reinforces the ability of the rest of the UK economy, from   manufacturing to the creative industries, to compete globally. And it broadens the investment opportunities   for UK savers, giving them the potential to earn better risk-adjusted returns.                                                                                                                    6   But the UK�s financial system is more than a national asset. It is also a global public good.     The UK is the leading internationally active financial centre. It has the largest global share of cross-border   bank lending and foreign exchange trading, the second largest asset management industry, and the fourth   largest insurance industry in the world. More foreign banks operate in the UK than in any other EU country,   and around half of the world�s largest financial firms have their European headquarters in the UK.     London is Europe�s investment banker, with UK-based firms involved in over half of debt and equity issuance   by EU27 borrowers. Over three-quarters of foreign exchange and OTC interest rate derivatives trading in the   EU takes place here. This concentration of activity increases efficiencies and lowers fees for European end   users, while reducing the risks associated with complex finance to European real economies.    4     More broadly, for centuries, the UK has bet on openness, and it has paid off handsomely. A more open economy, if properly   managed, can grow faster without generating inflationary pressures or risks to financial stability. Those benefits accrue through a   variety of channels. Openness increases dynamism by spreading knowledge and new technologies across borders; by enabling firms   to specialise and take advantage of economies of scale; and by better matching of savers and borrowers, lowering financing costs and   boosting investment. Openness increases choice for consumers. And it enables more effective risk-sharing, both across borders and   generations.   5     See �Total tax contribution of UK financial services, Ninth edition�, City of London Corporation Research Report in association with   PwC, available at https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/economic-research-and-information/research-   publications/Documents/research%202016/total-tax-report-2016.pdf.   6     See �The UK at the heart of a renewed globalisation�, speech given by Mark Carney, 24 October 2013, available at   http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2013/speech690.pdf.                                                                                                                                       4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                      4   The City has long been a leader in financial innovation from the development of the eurobond market in the   1960s through to becoming the Western hub for renminbi and rupee businesses, and Europe�s premier   centres for Islamic and green finance. London also has the most vibrant FinTech centre with revenues of                                                                                              7   �6.5 billion and employment of over 61,000, both of which are growing rapidly.     Alongside these benefits for the UK, Europe, and the world, there are risks � risks that first and foremost are   borne by the UK.     The UK financial system is almost ten times GDP, and is arguably the most sophisticated and complex in the   world. Large complex financial institutions and major wholesale financial markets are inherently risky. Left   unattended, these risks can easily spill over and damage the domestic real economy.     Openness and interconnectedness mean shocks from abroad quickly reach our shores. This is particularly   true for risks from the euro area given the tightness of our trade and financial linkages. Equally, these tight   linkages mean that others rely on us to maintain high standards of resilience and to share relevant   information openly and cooperatively.     In short, hosting the leading international financial sector brings immense responsibilities alongside great   prosperity. The Bank of England�s primary responsibility is to protect our domestic real economy, and to   ensure that finance serves it rather than the other way around. And second, we must ensure our institutions   and markets are sources of strength for the global system.     Fulfilling these dual responsibilities requires the highest standards of supervision and regulation, and a   commitment to the most effective cooperation with other regulators.     Let me take those in turn.     III.     The UK Targets a Level of Resilience Beyond Global Minimum Standards     As the FPC has repeatedly made clear, the UK financial system will require a post-Brexit level of resilience at   least as great as that currently planned, which itself generally exceeds that required by international baseline   standards. This imperative reflects the scale, complexity and importance of the UK financial system.     This does not mean we are pursuing the stability of the graveyard. Rather, we are building the necessary   resilience for our system as efficiently as possible by simultaneously implementing major structural reforms.   Such �efficient resilience� allows the UK financial system to fulfil both its domestic imperatives and its   international responsibilities.    7    See �The Promise of FinTech � Something New Under the Sun?�, speech by Mark Carney, 25 January 2017, available at   http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2017/speech956.pdf.                                                                                                                        5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                      5   Efficient resilience is why our capital standards are simultaneously well above Basel minimum requirements   and substantially below the levels that would be necessary if those banks could not be safely resolved if they                       8   got into trouble.     Efficient resilience is why we are ring-fencing the domestic banking services on which UK households and   companies depend. Requiring higher prudential requirements for a ring-fenced bank and structurally   separating it from wholesale and investment banking activities helps ensure that retail lending can be   sustained despite external shocks. At the same time, this approach preserves the free flow of capital   provided by wholesale banking activities across borders.     Efficient resilience is why we are building robust markets supported by the necessary hard and soft   infrastructure. This is how we reinforce the City�s genius which is based on its fundamental belief in the   power of markets.     We have comprehensively reformed how we provide liquidity. Our new approach can be described in four   words: we�re open for business. The Bank now provides liquidity against a wider range of collateral, to a                                                                                                    9   wider range of counterparties, for longer terms, at lower fees than ever before. Collateral totalling over   �400bn is prepositioned, ready for use if needed including in times of actual or prospective stress � as was   the case around the Referendum last year. Moreover, we stand ready to provide liquidity in a wide range of   foreign currencies if required.     Efficient resilience is why we are committed to world class supervision of UK-based globally systemic   financial market infrastructure. The UK has been at the forefront of implementing recovery and resolution   regimes for CCPs, well ahead of final international guidance. The Bank pioneered global colleges for CCPs.   And we have introduced �pre-funding� into our systemically important retail payments schemes, Bacs and   FPS, to eliminate settlement risk. Such initiatives have prompted the IMF to conclude that �the Bank is one   of the leaders worldwide in shaping reforms in this area�.     Finally, efficient resilience is why the Bank of England, working with the Financial Conduct Authority, has   been at the forefront of efforts to increase individual accountability in financial services. While the UK�s   action plan to improve conduct includes stronger deterrents and reduced opportunities for bad behaviour, we   recognise that ex post penalties are only part of the solution.       8     The FPC judges the appropriate Tier 1 capital requirement for the UK banking system, in aggregate, to be 13.5% of risk-weighted   assets (RWAs), as currently measured. This compares with around 10.5% including capital conservation and SIFI surcharge buffers   based on international standards. The Bank has also introduced a leverage ratio requirement in advance of international requirements   that currently amounts to, in aggregate, 3.3%. If resolution arrangements were not in place, the FPC is likely to have judged that the   appropriate baseline Tier 1 capital requirement for the UK banking system would be closer to 20% of RWAs than the current 13.5%.   9     Membership of the SMF has risen from 70 in 2008 to 190 today.

And we have put greater stress on the   importance of better governance and firm culture. At the heart of these efforts are new codes of conduct   developed by the market for the market, including those of the UK-based FICC Market Standards Board and                                                 10   the new global code for FX markets.     Since codes are of little use if no one reads, follows or enforces them, the UK has instituted a unique Senior   Managers Regime to embed cultures of risk awareness, openness and ethical behaviour. Based on its early   successes, international authorities are now considering following the UK�s lead.     IV.       Effective Supervisory Cooperation and Coordination is Essential     Better regulation is not enough. To build responsible financial globalisation, international authorities must   also share relevant information and work together to manage cross border challenges to financial stability.   There are three critical elements to international regulatory cooperation.     First, we need common minimum standards and consistent implementation. While regulations need not be   exactly the same, they should deliver similar outcomes. This is now possible given progress at the FSB,   where a series of agreed reforms are levelling the playing field and reducing opportunities for regulatory   arbitrage.     The UK is implementing its rules consistently, fairly and transparently. For example, the PRA�s regulatory   standards are the same for domestic and international banks. We allow third country branching, under                                                                                  11   certain conditions outlined in our 2014 Supervisory Statement.                      The key factors which have determined the   PRA�s stance towards non-EEA branches are the equivalence of the supervisory regime of the home state,   and arrangements for resolution.     Second, information sharing is fundamental. Even if two countries have exactly the same set of rules, if they   cannot share information on the financial positions of different entities within a global financial group, they   cannot clearly gauge and manage the risks that the firm may be running on a consolidated basis. We have   seen a few examples of the value of such cooperation in recent years.     The FSB and Basel Committee have developed a number of guidelines on information sharing, which have   helped foster trust, cooperation and enhanced dialogue between international regulators. These include   supervisory and crisis management colleges and supervisory assessments. The EU has further enshrined     10      A global code for the foreign exchange market, put together with support from central banks, will be launched in May as the first   globally consistent code of conduct for these markets.   11      �Supervising international banks: the Prudential Regulation Authority�s approach to branch supervision�, SS10/14, available at   http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/Documents/publications/ss/2014/ss1014.pdf.                                                                                                                                          7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                        7   these practices through legislative requirements in the CRR and BRRD for supervisors and resolution   authorities respectively.     The Bank is a staunch supporter of these mechanisms. As the home country regulator for four G-SIBs and   the host for all 30 G-SIBs we see them as essential elements of delivering global financial stability. We   participate actively in supervisory colleges, sharing the supervisory expertise we have developed from   managing the multitude of complex risks that are traded in London. And we expect the same from those   whose firms operate and take on large risks here. Symmetry is fundamental to an effective global system.     Third, the most critical element of supervisory cooperation is confidence in how each other will behave when   things go wrong. In this regard, operationalising new �gone concern� regimes are critical. These set out   what happens when a firm fails.     In our view, best practice is captured by the FSB�s Key Attributes and involves resolvability assessments and   regular crisis management group meetings for systemic firms. The UK was an early adopter. We host Crisis   Management Groups for the UK G-SIBs, G-SIIs and systemic CCPs and attend all such meetings   internationally for firms with significant operations in the UK. And we conduct exercises with other major   jurisdictions to test preparedness.     V.      The Road Ahead     We are at a fork in the road.     One path builds on the foundations of a new responsible global financial system that are being put in place.   The combination of robust international standards and trust built through transparent implementation and   intensive supervisory cooperation can create a system of enhanced equivalence and mutual deference.     Such an approach would allow capital to move more freely, efficiently and sustainably between jurisdictions.   With robust standards consistently applied, wholesale financial services could be brought more fully into   bilateral trade agreements, keeping the global financial system open and resilient, and supporting greater   trade, investment and innovation.     This high road leads to more jobs, higher sustainable growth, and better risk management across the G20.   But there is another path � the low road � where trust and cooperation diminish, fragmentation hardens,   capital flows are disrupted, and trade and innovation are curtailed. If authorities do not have sufficient   confidence that their efforts to promote financial stability are being reciprocated elsewhere, then concerns   about the risks of openness to domestic financial stability could intensify. If they do, domestic authorities will   act to safeguard their primary responsibilities.                                                                                                                     8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                  8   Without cooperation, host authorities may become more inclined to impose local requirements on domestic   entities, to insulate domestic stability in cases where there is no support from the group or coordination   amongst authorities in responding to distress. In a world where many banks and FMIs are highly   interconnected both financially and operationally that would generate significant inefficiencies, frustrating the   benefits that flow from open international trade and investment.     Taking the low road would be a sub-optimal for all, with fewer jobs, lower growth and higher domestic risks.     VI.      The Path Taken by Brexit     How the Brexit negotiations conclude will be a litmus test for responsible financial globalisation.     We start from a position where the high road is both readily attainable and highly desirable for all involved.   The UK and the rest of the EU have exactly the same rules governing our systems. And we have the most   highly developed frameworks for intensive supervisory cooperation. Capital flows seamlessly across our   borders. The current EU legal regime allows firms to passport throughout the Union, supervised by the   home supervisor.     The EU and UK are therefore ideally positioned to create an effective system of deference to each other�s   comparable regulatory outcomes, supported by commitments to common minimum standards and open   supervisory co-operation. These commitments could be reinforced by reliance on independent peer reviews   and a new, independent dispute resolution mechanism.     Such an outcome would be entirely consistent with the UK Government�s stated aim of a new,   comprehensive, bold and ambitious free trade relationship with the EU that embraces goods, services and   network industries.     And such an approach could be applied more broadly to the immense benefit of the global economy. The   UK and EU have the potential to create the template for trade in financial services � one that leverages the   tremendous progress that has been made in recent years building resilience and cooperation.     But financial services are only part of a much broader negotiation. Given our responsibilities to promote   financial stability, the Bank � like its counterparts on the continent � must plan, purely as a precaution, for all   eventualities. As the Vice Chair of the Supervisory Board of the Single Supervisory Mechanism recently                                                                                                                    12   stressed, for example, �both banks and supervisors must prepare for any potential scenario�.       12     �Introductory statement to the press conference on the ECB Annual Report on supervisory activities 2016�, remarks by Sabine   Lautenschl�ger, Vice Chair of the Supervisory Board of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, 27 March 2017.                                                                                                                                   9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                 9   Under one scenario, negotiations could result in a new statutory and regulatory regime with a large number   of firms � currently either physically based in the UK or providing services within the single market via   passporting arrangements � coming directly under PRA authorisation and supervision. In that case, we   would need to form our own judgments, rather than relying exclusively on those of others.     As our continental colleagues have observed in the analogous case of UK firms operating in Europe, these   judgements could affect whether the firm operates as a branch or a subsidiary, as well as the range of   services it can supply.     Consistent with our current approach, and the PRA�s stance towards non-EEA branches, any judgements   would reflect:            ?    the cooperative and information sharing arrangements in place;          ?    our confidence in the standards to which others are adhering; and          ?    any assurances we have on arrangements to address circumstances when things go wrong.     Ideally all of these issues would be addressed in a cooperative and symmetrical way, as part of the overall   agreement the UK will strike with the EU-27.     Whatever is agreed, there are risks to financial stability both in the transition to the new relationship and in   the new steady state. These risks include disruption of services, a further weakening of investment banking   profitability and the potential for greater complexity in firms� legal structures. Increased complexity would   place greater demands on firms� risk management and on supervisory oversight, and pose challenges for   effective resolution. We expect firms to plan accordingly.     So today, Sam Woods, the CEO of the PRA, is writing to all firms with cross-border activities between the UK   and the rest of the EU asking them to inform us of their own planning in response to the UK�s decision to   leave the EU. These include, for example, subsidiaries of US investment banks based in London doing   business throughout the EU under passporting arrangements, as well as UK banks doing likewise, and   branches of institutions from other EU states operating here in London. The main purpose of this letter is to   ensure that all firms are making, and stand ready to execute in good time should the need arise, contingency   plans for the full range of possible scenarios. The FPC will oversee this process of contingency planning to                                             13   mitigate risks to financial stability.     Asking firms to plan thoroughly is the hallmark of the prepared and professional approach we take to   promote financial stability.      13        The statement is available at http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/news/2017/008.pdf.                                                                                                                      10     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                     10   VII.     Conclusion     The UK has been at the forefront of efforts to make the global financial system safer, simpler and fairer.   Recognising our role as guardians of the leading international financial centre, we have gone further than   these minimum global standards.     These efforts ensure that the world�s largest international financial centre both protects and serves the UK   economy. And they mean that others can rely on us as a pillar of strength for the international monetary and   financial system.     As the FPC has made clear, we won�t turn our backs on these hard won gains. There should be no bonfire   of financial regulation. But we will be dynamic � learning by doing and making adjustments, as necessary, to   optimise our efforts without compromising on the level of resilience the world�s leading international financial   centre demands.     We will ring fence our banks to protect the core retail financial services they provide to households and   companies.     We won�t allow undercapitalised, opaque financial institutions to operate freely within our borders.   But, while we won�t hesitate to do what�s necessary to protect the UK real economy, we will also work   tirelessly for a responsible and open financial system that benefits all.     A decade of hard fought financial reform creates enormous opportunities.     It is all too easy to give into protectionism, but the road less taken is often the most rewarding. All the   conditions are in place for following the high road of mutual recognition and cooperation both with Europe   and across the G20.     The UK has the expertise, the temperament and the will to take this path, one that will make all the difference   to all our citizens.                                                                                                                      11     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                 11"
2017-04-27	"Building the Infrastructure to Realise FinTech�s Promise    Speech given by   Mark Carney,   Governor of the Bank of England     International FinTech Conference 2017, Old Billingsgate    12 April 2017       I am grateful to Nicola Anderson, Sharmista Appaya, Alice Carr, Helen George, Andrew Hauser,   Rosey Jeffrey, Varun Paul, Gregory Stevens and Iain de Weymarn for their assistance in preparing   these remarks.                                                                                                       1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches   Introduction    It�s a pleasure to be in this historic setting at the heart of the world�s leading international financial centre and                                  1   its global hub for FinTech.    Such leadership reflects the UK�s inherent strengths: its people, law, language and time zone. And it is   testament to the City�s fundamental belief in markets and innovation.    Over the centuries, we have learned that markets and innovation thrive with the right hard and soft   infrastructure: hard infrastructure ranging from transport links to broadband and payments architecture; and   soft infrastructure from the rule of law to market practices, codes of conduct, and regulatory frameworks.                                                          ---------------------------    When Horace Jones was re-imagining Old Billingsgate Market, Britain was in the throes of its Second   Industrial Revolution � a time of mass innovation that changed the way people lived, worked and interacted.    Throughout the nineteenth century technological advances � including steam, electricity, and the telegraph �   fostered new industries and made possible an unprecedented openness to trade, people, and ideas.    London�s financiers, book keepers and lawyers provided the capital, infrastructure and know-how to support   these trends, cementing the City�s status as the leading international financial centre.    The result was an unprecedented surge in prosperity. While UK real GDP merely doubled during the                                                                                                       2   eighteenth century, it increased 7-fold during the course of the nineteenth century.    There were risks alongside such growth. The century was punctuated by a succession of crises and a lost   decade.    It took decades to develop the necessary soft infrastructure to support more sustainable growth. Indeed only   by the late 1800s did the Bank of England assume its vital roles as lender of last resort and informal                                            3   supervisor of the banking system.    Similarly, around the turn of the millennium during the Third Industrial Revolution, a series of technological   innovations � including a revolution in computing power, the internet, and mobile telephony � fed a new   wave of openness and growth.       1     See the Global Financial Centres Index (2016) at: http://www.longfinance.net/global-financial-centre-index-19/992-gfci-19.html and   Ernst and Young, �FinTech on the Cutting Edge�, (2016): http://www.ey.com/uk/en/industries/financial-services/banking--capital-   markets/ey-uk-fintech-on-the-cutting-edge   2     Bank of England, �Three centuries of macroeconomic data� at: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Pages/datasets/default.aspx   3     See Bank Underground articles on the crises of 1847, 1857 and 1866 and the development of the role of the Bank of England at:   https://bankunderground.co.uk/2016/12/19/christmas-special-financial-crises-in-the-19th-century/. New laws emerged in the mid-19th   century, allowing the spread of joint stock banks across the country, to finance the growing needs of the economy.                                                                                                                                     2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                    2   The accompanying burst of financial innovation spread the application of these technologies and supported   the process of globalisation that bolstered trade, productivity and incomes.    Once again, however, the hard and soft infrastructure of the financial system failed to keep pace. Light-   touch regulation, out-moded codes of market conduct, inadequate settlement and clearing infrastructure all   contributed to the global financial crisis.    We can draw on these experiences to help ensure that FinTech boosts growth and promotes financial   stability.    Not least because, following a raft of post-crisis reforms, the Bank�s regulatory frameworks are now fit for   purpose.    The Bank of England�s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) is mandated to assess new and emerging risks to   financial stability, including those that may exist beyond the existing regulatory perimeter. And it now has the                                                                                4   powers to treat similar risks consistently, wherever they originate.    With this new approach, the Bank can help build the right infrastructure for FinTech to realise its promise.    The Promise of FinTech    To its advocates, FinTech will democratise financial services.    Consumers will get more choice and keener pricing.    SMEs will get access to new credit.    Banks will become more productive, with lower transaction costs, greater capital efficiency and stronger   operational resilience.    Financial services will be more inclusive; with people better connected, more informed and increasingly   empowered.    And tantalisingly, FinTech could help make the system itself more resilient with greater diversity, redundancy   and depth.    These possibilities are why the Bank has already taken a number of steps to encourage FinTech�s   development.       4    For a summary of the new regulatory arrangements see �Changes to the Bank of England�, Murphy, E. and Senior, S, Quarterly   Bulletin Article (Q1 2013).                                                                                                                                 3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                               3   The PRA and the FCA have changed their authorisation processes to support new business models. The   New Bank Start-Up Unit, created in 2016, works closely with firms seeking to become banks. Already, four                                                        5   new �mobile� banks have been authorised.    The Bank also established a FinTech Accelerator last year. Since then, we have worked with a number of   firms on proofs of concept ranging from strengthening our cyber security to using AI for regulatory data, and   improving our understanding of distributed ledgers.    Today we are opening our 4th round of applications to the Accelerator. We are looking to work on new   proofs of concept on maintaining privacy in a distributed ledger and applying a range of big data tools to                                         6   support the Bank�s analysis.    More broadly, the Bank is working to ensure that this time the right hard and soft infrastructure are in place to   allow innovation to thrive while keeping the system safe.    Let me expand briefly with three examples.    The Right Soft Infrastructure    First, with respect to soft infrastructure, the Bank is assessing how FinTech could change risks and   opportunities along the financial services value chain. We are then using our existing frameworks to respond   where necessary.    We are disciplined. Just because something is new doesn�t mean it should be treated differently. Similarly,   just because it is outside the regulatory perimeter doesn�t mean it needs to be brought inside. We apply   consistent approaches to activities that give rise to the same risks regardless of whether those are   undertaken by old regulated or new FinTech firms.    Some of the most important questions we are considering include:         -    Which FinTech activities constitute traditional banking activities by another name and should be                                     7             regulated as such?         -    How could developments change the safety and soundness of existing regulated firms?         -    How could developments change potential macroeconomic and macrofinancial dynamics including             disruptions to systemically important markets?

To illustrate some of the issues, consider how FinTech is affecting the financial services value chain (Figure   1).    Figure 1: Financial Services Value Chain       At present, the most significant changes are taking place at the front-end, where innovative payment service   providers (PSPs) are providing new user interfaces for domestic retail and cross-border payment services                                                          8   through digital wallets or pre-funded eMoney.    Other aspects of the customer relationships are being opened up. For example, aggregators are providing   customers with ready access to price comparison and switching services. This will increase further when                                                                                                9   aggregators gain access to banks� Application Programme Interfaces (APIs).    These new entrants are capturing potentially invaluable customer data which can be used to target non-bank                              10   products and services.      8     For example, more than 80% of incumbent financial institutions thought their customers were already using FinTech companies to   make payments whilst nearly 70% thought they were doing the same for fund transfer and around 60% for personal finance. Only 50%   thought their customers were doing so for traditional deposits and savings. See PWC �Global FinTech Report� (2017).   9     The second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) will allow, conditional FCA authorisation and customer authority, non-banks to access   customers� bank account data. In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority has required that the UK�s nine largest banks adopt   an open banking standard for APIs by early 2018.                                                                                                                                    5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                    5   In their current form, these innovations are simply a new front-end to the banking system where FinTech   providers take a slice of customer revenue and loyalty but none of the associated risks.    They have generally avoided undertaking traditional banking activities. So for now, absent a substantive   change in business models or scale of activities, the FPC is unlikely to want to bring these firms into the                             11   regulatory perimeter.    The changes to customer relationships resulting from FinTech competition could, however, reduce customer   loyalty and the stability of funding of incumbent banks. If this happens, the Bank of England would need to   ensure prudential standards and resolution regimes for the affected banks are sufficiently robust to these   risks.    Figure 2: Financial Services Value Chain and Our Infrastructure       10      For an overview of the changes occurring further along the value chain see: �The promise of FinTech: something new under the   sun?�, a speech given by Mark Carney on 25 January 2017, at the Deutsche Bundesbank G20 conference on �Digitising finance,   financial inclusion and financial literacy�, Wiesbaden. Available at:   http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2017/956.aspx   11      Were any FinTech providers to become systemic in their own right, they could be brought into the regulatory perimeter; this could be   under the existing statutory framework for designating systemic financial market infrastructure (FMIs), for example.                                                                                                                                        6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                       6   The Right Hard Infrastructure    A second, related example is how the Bank is working to develop the financial system�s hard infrastructure to   allow innovation to thrive while keeping the system safe.    Specifically, the Bank is widening access to some of its systems to include PSPs in order to boost both   competition and system resilience.    The UK has led the world in innovation in the wider payments ecosystem. And we are committed to keeping   pace with customer demands for payments that are seamless, reliable, cheap, and ubiquitous. Our   challenge is how to satisfy these expectations while maintaining a resilient payment systems infrastructure.    That�s important because the Bank operates the UK�s high-value payment system �RTGS� which each day   processes �1/2 trillion of payments on behalf of everyone from homeowners to global banks.   Understandably, we have an extremely low tolerance for any threat to the integrity of the system�s   �plumbing�.    Currently, only 52 institutions have settlement accounts in RTGS. Indirect users of the system typically   access settlement via one of four agent banks. These indirect users include 1000 non-bank PSPs at the   front-end of the financial services value chain. As they grow, some PSPs want to reduce their reliance on   the systems, service levels, risk appetite and frankly goodwill of the very banks with whom they are   competing.    The Bank has decided to widen access to RTGS to include non-bank PSPs in order to help them compete                                             12   on a level playing field with banks.           The Bank of England is now working with the FCA and HMT to make   this a reality, and we will issue our new blueprint for RTGS in early May.    Coordinated Developments in Hard and Soft Infrastructure    My third example of the Bank�s efforts to realise FinTech�s promise is our work with industry to help   coordinate advances in hard and soft infrastructure.    New technologies could transform wholesale payments, clearing and settlement. In particular, distributed   ledger technology could yield significant gains in the accuracy, efficiency and security of such processes,                                                                                                                                   13   saving tens of billions of pounds of bank capital and significantly improving the resilience of the system.       12      See �Enabling the FinTech Transformation�, the speech Mark Carney intended to deliver at Mansion House on 16 June 2016.   Available at: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2016/914.aspx.   13      Oliver Wyman and Santander estimated that distributed ledger technology could reduce banks� infrastructure costs attributable to   cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance by $15-20bn per annum by 2022. See:   https://santanderinnoventures.com/fintech2/                                                                                                                                         7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                       7   Securities settlement seems particularly ripe for innovation. A typical settlement chain involves many   intermediaries, making it comparatively slow and keeping operational risks high. Industry has begun to work   together to determine how distributed ledger technologies could be used to solve these issues at scale.    The Bank is participating in several related initiatives. To help distinguish distributed ledger�s potential from   its hype, we have completed our own Proof of Concept. We are a member of Hyperledger along with                                                       14   private market participants and tech firms.              And we will make our next generation RTGS compatible with   settlement in a distributed ledger.    It is not clear, however, that that the only challenges are technological. Indeed, the FCA highlighted earlier                                                                                                  15   this week that settlement times could also be cut using existing technologies.                      This requires market   participants to change their collective practices as it takes more than one intermediary in a chain to   compress settlement times.    Conclusion    FinTech�s promise springs from its potential to unbundle banking into its core functions of settling payments,   performing maturity transformation, sharing risk and allocating capital.    This possibility is being realised by new entrants � payment service providers, aggregators and robo   advisors, peer-to-peer lenders, and innovative trading platforms. And it is being influenced by incumbents   who are adopting new technologies to reinforce the economies of scale and scope of their business models.    FinTech could deliver significant benefits to households and businesses across this country and across the   world. FinTech can widen access to financial services and bring new sources of credit. It can connect   customers better with their finances and empower them more in the process. And new technologies can   deliver faster service, greater choice and keener pricing.       14      Hyperledger is an open source collaborative effort intended to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. It is a global   collaboration which includes leaders in finance, banking, IoT, supply chain, manufacturing and technology.

Changes to customer loyalties could influence the stability of bank funding.   New underwriting models could impact credit quality and even macroeconomic dynamics. New investing   and risk management paradigms could affect market functioning.    At the same time, the resilience of the system could also be built, through greater diversity in provision of   financial services as well as increased redundancy. A host of applications could reduce costs, improve   capital efficiency and strengthen operational resilience.    The challenge for policymakers is to ensure that FinTech develops in a way that maximises the opportunities   and minimises the risks for society.    We are ideally positioned to realise FinTech�s promise in the UK.    The Bank will work with the market and other authorities to build the hard and soft infrastructure the system   needs to support innovation and growth, consistent with the City�s best traditions.                                                                                                                       9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                 9"
2017-04-28	"What a Difference a Decade Makes    Mark Carney   Governor of the Bank of England   Chair of the Financial Stability Board      Remarks at the Institute of International Finance�s Washington Policy Summit, the Reagan   Centre, Washington DC    20 April 2017       I am grateful to Alice Carr, Wayne Chapman, Carsten Jung and Iain de Weymarn for their assistance   in preparing these remarks.                                                                                                          1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx   Introduction    It�s a pleasure to be back at the IIF�s Washington Policy Summit.                                                                                                                       1   Last time I spoke here (in 2011) it was still early in the international financial reform process. From the IIF�s   perspective at the time, there were three major concerns:         -    The consistency of implementation across the G20;         -    The possibility of significant regulatory arbitrage in shadow banking; and         -    Whether the FSB/G20�s ambitious agenda would impair the recovery.    Today, those debates have largely been settled.    First, the new international minimum standards are being, by and large, consistently and promptly   implemented in G20 jurisdictions. This progress is regularly assessed and transparently reported by the FSB                  2   and the IMF. And in general, when countries have deviated from international standards, it�s because they   have chosen to go further.    Second, activities which give rise to similar risks are being treated consistently regardless of where they   originate. A series of measures have addressed the major regulatory arbitrage opportunities that   encouraged shadow banking. Contingent exposures of banks have been brought on balance sheet and   appropriately capitalised. More generally, shadow banking is being replaced with market-based finance that   adds diversification, competition and resilience to the system.    As for the macroeconomic impacts, it has been apparent for some time that having well-capitalised, liquid   banks is a pre-requisite�rather than an impediment�to growth. In those economies where reform has                                                                                  3   moved the quickest, the recoveries have been the most robust.    Indeed, the broader benefits of reforms are now being realised as the global financial system moves from   fragility to resilience. Credit is now growing in all major economies. The cost of financing has remained low.   Sources of finance are increasingly diversified between banks and markets. And the system is   demonstrating an ability to dampen shocks rather than amplify them.    The biggest question now is how to best take advantage of these years of hard work. In my remarks today, I   will suggest three priorities.    1     �Some current issues in financial reform�, remarks by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the IIF, Washington DC, 25   September 2011. See: www.bis.org/review/r110927a.pdf.   2     The FSB conducts thematic and country-specific peer reviews (see http://www.fsb.org/what-we-do/implementation-   monitoring/peer_reviews/) and the IMF conducts Article IV consultations and the Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) (see   https://www.imf.org/external/about/econsurv.htm and https://www.imf.org/external/np/fsap/fssa.aspx).   3     Countries like Canada and Australia, with well capitalised and generally well-managed banks that did not require any bail-outs, saw   their economies substantially outperform their peers in the wake of the crisis. Of the countries at its epicentre, those that moved most   decisively, like the US, have experienced the fastest recoveries. And now that Europe is making significant progress, growth there has   begun to pick up and broaden.                                                                                                                                        2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                        2   First, reform implementation must not only be effective but also dynamic. That means adjusting measures if   there are unnecessary duplications, inconsistencies or material unintended consequences. The objective   isn�t just resilience, but efficient resilience.    Second, we must resist steps that would fragment the global financial system.    Instead, we should take full advantage of the progress made by building a system of deference to each   other�s approaches when they achieve comparable outcomes.    What a Difference a Decade Makes    A decade ago, regulatory frameworks in advanced economies had become light touch and ineffective.   Looming risks in the financial system were ignored. Markets were fragile and unfair, plagued by numerous   instances of misconduct and insufficient market discipline on large firms. And few participants were exposed   to the full consequences of their actions as governance and compensation arrangements focused on the   short term.    In Washington in 2008 in the aftermath of the Lehman debacle, G20 Leaders committed to radical reform of   the financial system, and they charged the FSB with fixing the fault lines that caused the financial crisis.    The comprehensive reform programme had four main components:           -   Creating resilient banks           -   Ending too big to fail           -   Transforming shadow banking into market-based finance; and           -   Making derivative markets safer.    A decade on, this programme has largely been achieved. The financial system is safer, simpler, and fairer.    The financial system is safer    A central achievement has been the transformation of banking.    A decade ago, banks were woefully undercapitalised (some were levered over 50 times), with complex   business models that relied on the goodwill of markets and, ultimately, taxpayers.    Large global banks are now considerably stronger. They can stand on their own.    With capital requirements for the largest that are ten times higher, banks have raised more than $1.5 trillion   of capital. And they are disciplined by a new leverage ratio that guards against risks that seem low but prove   not.                                                                                                                   3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                3   Banks are also more robust because they have changed their funding models, not least due to new global   liquidity standards.    The financial system is simpler    The system is simpler in part because, a decade on, banks are less complex and more focused. They lend   more to households and businesses, and less to each other.    Business strategies that relied on high leverage, risky trading activities and wholesale funding are   disappearing, as intended. Trading assets have been cut in half, and interbank lending is down by two-   thirds.    In parallel, the system is simpler because a series of measures are eliminating the fragile forms of shadow   banking while reinforcing the best of resilient market-based finance.    A decade ago, off-balance-sheet vehicles masked enormous leverage. Monoline insurers supported                                                                                                                                          4   unsustainable debts, and banks became overly reliant on fragile short-term funding from money markets.   As the complex chains in shadow banking unravelled, a spiral of asset fire sales and liquidity strikes   followed, threatening the stability of the entire system and withdrawing access to credit from millions of   households and businesses.    In response, the FSB set out a comprehensive framework � the Shadow Banking Road Map � to strengthen   oversight and regulation of shadow banking.    A decade on from the ABCP crisis, the toxic forms of shadow banking at the heart of the crisis � with their   large funding mismatches, high leverage and opaque, off-balance-sheet arrangements � no longer represent                              5   a global stability risk.    And other, more constructive, forms of shadow banking, including money market funds and repo markets,   are now subject to policy measures that reduce their risks and reinforce their benefits.    In tandem, global assets under management have grown rapidly from around $50 trillion a decade ago to                                                                                             6   $77 trillion in 2015, equivalent to 40% of total financial system assets.    This growth creates new sources of funding and investment, promotes international capital flows, reduces   reliance on bank funding, and brings welcome diversity to the financial system.       4     Broker dealers were involved in market intermediation with short-term funding, opacity in securitisation gave rise to imperfect credit risk   transfer, and money market funds were major purchasers of risky bank certificates of deposit and of asset backed commercial paper.   5     These risks have been addressed through reforms to money market funds in the US, broker dealer regulation and securitisation   reforms.   6     See FSB Policy Recommendations to Address Structural Vulnerabilities from Asset Management Activities.                                                                                                                                              4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                             4   At the same time, however, asset management�s importance reinforces the need to minimise the risk of   sudden stops in times of stress. The FSB estimates that in 2015, more than $20 trillion of assets were held                                            7   in funds susceptible to such risks.    In January 2017, responding to the direction of G20 Leaders in Hangzhou, the FSB finalised its   recommendations to address structural vulnerabilities and reduce liquidity mismatches associated with asset                                                                                                        8   management. These recommendations are now being operationalised by IOSCO.    The financial system is also simpler because more durable market infrastructure is untangling the previously   complex � and dangerous � web of exposures in derivatives markets.    A decade ago, OTC derivative trades were largely unregulated, unreported and bilaterally cleared.   Uncertainty about such exposures contributed to the panic.    In Pittsburgh in 2009, the G20 announced a series of reforms designed to make these markets safer and   more transparent, including by requiring trade reporting and by encouraging central clearing of OTC trades.    CCPs reduce contagion risks in banking, and they make the massive derivatives markets more robust. The   extent to which they reduce overall systemic risks, however, depends on their resilience and resolvability.    To those ends, CPMI-IOSCO and the FSB will deliver further, detailed guidance for CCP resilience, recovery   and resolvability to the Hamburg Summit. By the 2018 G20 Summit in Argentina, the FSB will report whether   any additional financial resources are required to resolve safely CCPs.    The financial system is fairer    The system is fairer because of reforms that are ending the era of �too big to fail� banks and addressing the   root causes of a torrent of misconduct.    A decade ago, large complex banks operated in a �heads I win tails you lose� bubble. They privatised profits   in the run-up to the crisis before socialising the losses when the music stopped.    The loss of confidence in private finance that crystallised in the autumn of 2008 could only be arrested by   public support over the following year that totalled $15 trillion in bail-outs, government guarantees of bank                                                                   9   liabilities and special central bank liquidity schemes.    To bring back the discipline of the market and end reliance on public funds, FSB members have agreed   standards to ensure that major banks can fail safely in future.   7     Such collective investment vehicles with run risk now account for almost two-thirds of identified shadow banking up from about 40%   prior to the crisis.   8     Work on liquidity mismatches in open-ended funds is scheduled to be completed by end-2017 and development of consistent leverage   measures by the end-2018. The FSB has now completed its work under the Shadow Banking Roadmap. It has not identified new   shadow banking risks that require additional regulatory action at global level. Of course, since new forms of shadow banking activities   are certain to develop in the future, FSB members will continue to monitor for emerging risks, and share data and analysis in order to   support any future regulatory response.   9     The data refer to the UK, the US and the Euro Area, as of June 2009 (see Bank of England Financial Stability Report, June 2009).                                                                                                                                       5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                       5   These include reforms to secure the tools and powers authorities need to deal decisively with failing banks.   At the same time, major banks are required to make themselves easier to resolve, including by writing �living   wills�.    Most importantly, global standards now require that banks hold sufficient debt in life such that, in the event   one fails, its successor can be recapitalised to support the continued operation of its most important   activities.    The combination of these initiatives and the determination of authorities to complete the job explains why the   too-big-to-fail public subsidy for private systemic banks has fallen by 90% in the UK.    Put simply, a decade on, market discipline is coming back.    The system is also fairer because we are addressing the root causes of misconduct.    In the wake of the crisis, a series of scandals ranging from mis-selling to manipulation undermined trust in   banking, the financial system and to a degree markets themselves.    The economic consequences have been enormous. Global banks� misconduct costs have now reached over   $320 billion � capital that could otherwise have been used to support up to $5 trillion of lending to   households and businesses.    The FSB�s misconduct action plan addresses these issues through:         (i)      improvements to financial institutions� governance and compensation structures to align better                 risk and reward;         (ii)     new global standards of conduct in fixed income, commodities and currency markets; and         (iii)    reforms to major financial benchmark arrangements to reduce the risks of their manipulation.    Authorities cannot and should not try to legislate for every circumstance, watch every transaction, or   anticipate every market innovation. So while fines and sanctions have roles in deterring misconduct, they will   not, on their own, bring about the cultural change we need.    In the view of UK authorities, we must move from an excessive reliance on punitive, ex post fines of firms to   greater emphasis on more compelling ex ante incentives for individuals, and ultimately a more solid   grounding in improved firm culture.    In the UK a significant proportion of variable compensation for senior employees now must be deferred for a   period of seven years. This ensures that it can be clawed back over the time scale it generally takes for   conduct issues to come to light.                                                                                                                       6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                  6   To address the �rolling bad apples� problem, mechanisms are now in place in the UK to ensure that when   individuals move on their history will be known to those who consider hiring them. The FSB is now   considering whether to adopt such an approach more broadly.    UK authorities have used their convening powers to encourage market participants to establish standards of   market practice that are well understood, widely followed and, crucially, that keep pace with market   developments.    That�s why the global FICC Market Standards Board is establishing readily understood standards for their   markets. And it�s why global FX Committees will launch in May the first consistent code of conduct for FX   markets. The best in the markets are codifying the best of markets.    But codes are of little use if nobody reads, follows, or enforces them. This is where the UK�s Senior   Managers Regime (SMR) for senior decision-makers of banks, building societies and major investment firms   comes in.    The SMR addresses the common refrain of senior management that they weren�t aware that misconduct was   taking place in their firms.    The SMR re-establishes the link between seniority and accountability. Senior Managers now must take   reasonable steps (including training or proper oversight) to prevent or stop regulatory breaches in their areas   of responsibility.    Adoption is spreading. Some international firms are voluntarily adopting elements of the SMR�s certification   requirements to strengthen their global operations. And the FSB is now reviewing the merits of such   �responsibility mapping�.    A decade on, individual responsibility is returning.    Three Priorities to Move Forward in the Decade Ahead    There are three priorities to maximise the benefit of the progress made over the past decade.    Dynamic Implementation    Full, timely and consistent implementation of G20 reforms remains essential to deliver a financial system that   supports growth in the short, medium and long term. We must finish the job to build the level of resilience   our citizens deserve.    But we should do so as efficiently as possible.                                                                                                                     7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx               7   Implementation must not only be effective; it must also be dynamic. That is, authorities must learn by doing   and make adjustments, as necessary, to optimise our efforts, without compromising on the level of resilience   the reforms are intended to achieve.    The FSB is increasingly focused on assessing whether the reforms are achieving their intended outcomes.   To embed a dynamic approach, the FSB is now developing a structured framework to evaluate reforms. The   framework, which will be delivered to the G20 Summit in Hamburg, will support more comprehensive impact   analysis and will help inform future decisions about any possible adjustments to the reforms.    Specifically, it will assess whether G20 reforms are achieving their intended outcomes, identify any                                                                                                                     10   regulatory gaps or emerging risks, and flag any potential material unintended consequences.    As we assess the effectiveness of reforms at a global level, many national authorities are conducting similar   exercises with respect to their domestic efforts. These are to be welcomed, provided the overall level of   resilience is maintained.    Resisting Fragmentation    There are, however, other nascent risks that, if left unchecked, could threaten the progress made, and,   ultimately undermine the G20�s objective for strong, sustainable and balanced growth.    These risks include the impact of reform fatigue on implementation momentum, the outcome of Brexit   negotiations, the need to complete Basel III, and the importance of finishing the job of ending too big to fail.    In many respects, the global financial system is at a fork in the road.    On one path, trust and cooperation diminishes, fragmentation hardens, capital flows are disrupted, and trade   and innovation are curtailed. If authorities do not have sufficient confidence that their efforts to promote   financial stability are being reciprocated elsewhere, then concerns about the risks of openness could   intensify.    If that happens, domestic authorities could impose local requirements on domestic entities of foreign firms. In   a world where many banks and FMIs are highly interconnected that would generate significant inefficiencies,   frustrating the benefits that flow from open trade and investment.    Taking this low road would be sub-optimal for all, with fewer jobs, lower growth and higher domestic risks.       10     One example is a report by the Committee on the Global Financial System on the resilience of global repo markets that is being   delivered to the G20 this week.                                                                                                                                      8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                    8   But there is another path: the high road. This builds on the foundations of a new responsible global financial   system that are being put in place. The combination of robust international standards and greater trust as a   consequence of transparent implementation and intensive supervisory cooperation can create a system of   enhanced equivalence and mutual deference.    Such an approach would allow capital to move more freely, efficiently and sustainably between jurisdictions.   With robust standards consistently applied, wholesale financial services could be brought more fully into   trade agreements, keeping the global financial system open and resilient, and supporting greater trade,   investment and innovation.    This high road leads to more jobs, higher sustainable growth, and better risk management across the G20.    Working Together to Take Full Advantage    The high road can be followed if my third priority � taking full advantage of the progress made � is pursued.    In this regard, it is important not just to recognise progress made but how it has been made.    The FSB has succeeded by emphasising collaboration, consensus and openness. Its strength lies in its   members who bring authority, expertise and shared objectives.    The FSB is not a treaty-based organisation, so its standards do not have direct force in any member   jurisdiction. Decisions are ultimately matters for national authorities who � acting out of enlightened self-   interest and in recognition of the benefits of a resilient and open global financial system � guide and   discipline the reform process.    As such, FSB reforms would amount to little if they did not represent the best collective judgement of our   members on how to deliver efficient resilience.    But because they are the product of the authority, expertise and shared objectives of its members, the FSB   reforms create the foundations for an open, global financial system.    We now have agreed common minimum standards that are being consistently and transparently   implemented. The playing field for cross border activities is being levelled. Opportunities for regulatory   arbitrage are being reduced.    In short, a platform is being created for deference to each other�s approaches when they achieve similar   outcomes.    To seize this opportunity and to build responsible financial globalisation, authorities also need to share   relevant information and work together to manage cross border challenges to financial stability.                                                                                                                       9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                 9   The FSB and Basel Committee have developed a number of information sharing guidelines to help foster   trust and cooperation between international regulators. These include supervisory colleges and crisis   management groups.    One of the most critical elements of supervisory cooperation is understanding how each other will behave   when things go wrong. In this regard, operationalising new �gone concern� regimes is critical. Best practice   is captured by the FSB�s Key Attributes and involves resolvability assessments and regular crisis                                                               11   management group meetings for systemic firms.    In the decade ahead, members of the G20 will be increasingly well-positioned to defer to each other�s   comparable regulatory outcomes, supported by commitments to common minimum standards and open   supervisory co-operation. These commitments could be reinforced by reliance on independent peer reviews   and a new, independent dispute resolution mechanism.    Brexit will be a litmus test of the future of international cooperation. The UK and the rest of the EU have   exactly the same rules and the most highly developed frameworks of supervisory cooperation. Their capital   and banking markets are already highly integrated. They have the potential to create the template for trade   in financial services.    Conclusion    A decade on from the start of the crisis, the G20 is building an efficient and resilient financial system which   serves our domestic economies and supports sustainable cross-border investment and economic activity.    As the global recovery strengthens and broadens, now is the time to take full advantage of these hard won   gains.    That means completing the journey from fragility to resilience by ensuring that:         -    shadow banking is fully transformed into resilient market-based finance,         -    durable market infrastructure is in place,         -    we complete the job of ending too big to fail, and         -    emerging vulnerabilities are addressed in a timely and consistent manner.    That means adjusting the reform measures dynamically to maximise efficient resilience and avoid   unintended consequences.       11      The UK was an early adopter. We host crisis management groups for the UK�s globally systemic banks, insurers, and systemic CCPs   and attend all such meetings internationally for firms with significant operations in the UK. And we conduct exercises with other major   jurisdictions to test preparedness.                                                                                                                                       10     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                       10   That means recognising that because risks to financial stability are constantly evolving we must continue to                                                                                                                  12   work together to identify emerging vulnerabilities in a timely and consistent manner.    And that means not merely resisting the forces of fragmentation but actively building an open global financial   system that places increasing reliance on, and deference to, each other�s national regimes when they   achieve similar outcomes.    A decade on from the start of the crisis, now is the time to take the high road to the benefit of all.       12        Just as the FSB is doing in its work to assess the financial stability implications � both opportunities and risks � of FinTech.                                                                                                                                           11     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                          11"

Introduction    My Lord Mayor, Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen.    In recent weeks, we have been reminded of fine balances: in decisions, in parliament, in life. The fine                                              1   balance between hope and despair.    Despair at the murder of Jo Cox. Hope in her remarkable life of service � an inspiration that lives on in her   family, friends, colleagues and many admirers.    Despair at the terrorist attacks in Manchester, Borough Market and Finsbury Park. Despair at the tragedy of   Grenfell Tower.    Hope in the heroism, resiliency and the community of the responses. Hope when we recognise our common   humanity.    The best tribute this City and this Country can give to the memories of those lost is to renew our shared   commitment � whatever our differences � to promote the common good.    This includes pursuing a Brexit, and building an economy, that works for all.                                                      -------------------------------------    Since the prospect of Brexit emerged, financial markets, notably sterling, have marked down the UK�s                            2   economic prospects.    Monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely to accompany the transition to new   trading arrangements with the EU. But it can influence how this hit to incomes is distributed between job   losses and price rises. And it can support households and businesses as they adjust to such profound   change. Indeed, in such exceptional circumstances, the MPC is required to balance any trade-off between   the speed with which it returns inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy   provides to jobs and activity.    That is why last summer the Bank announced a series of monetary and macro-financial measures to support   the economy during this transition. This stimulus is working. Credit is widely available, the cost of borrowing   is near record lows, the economy has outperformed expectations, and unemployment has reached a 40 year   low.    As spare capacity erodes, the trade-off that the MPC must balance lessens, and all else equal, its tolerance   for above-target inflation falls. Different members of the MPC will understandably have different views about   1     �A Fine Balance� by Rohinton Mistry.   2     The sterling ERI has fallen close to 20% from its November 2015 peak. Since then, UK-focused equity prices have fallen by over 2%.   In contrast, broader equity price indices such as the FTSE 100 and S&P 500, which more heavily reflect global economic   considerations, are almost 20% and 40% higher respectively (in sterling terms). UK 10-year real government bond yields have fallen   115 basis points; by contrast 10-year real government bond yields in the US are down by around 25 basis points only.                                                                                                                                    2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                    2   the outlook and therefore on the potential timing of any Bank Rate increase. But all expect that any changes   would be limited in scope and gradual in pace.    From my perspective, given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given   the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anaemic wage growth, now is not yet the time   to begin that adjustment. In the coming months, I would like to see the extent to which weaker consumption   growth is offset by other components of demand, whether wages begin to firm, and more generally, how the   economy reacts to the prospect of tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations.    During the negotiating period the economy will be importantly influenced by the expectations of households,   firms and financial markets about the nature of both the transition and the longer term economic relationships   with the EU and other countries.    Markets have already anticipated some of the adjustment. Depending on whether and when any transition   arrangement can be agreed, firms on either side of the channel may soon need to activate contingency   plans. Before long, we will all begin to find out the extent to which Brexit is a gentle stroll along a smooth   path to a land of cake and consumption.    Whatever happens, monetary policy will be set to return inflation sustainably to target while supporting as   best it can the necessary adjustments in the economy.                                                        -------------------------------------    I would like to spend the rest of my time on another balance, or rather other imbalances, whose resolution   will be an important determinant of our future prosperity.    II. The Challenge of Global Imbalances    With many concerned that global trade is taking local jobs, protectionist sentiments are once again rising   across the advanced world. Excessive trade and current account imbalances are now politically as well as   economically unsustainable.    Perhaps because imbalances ultimately reflect savings and investment choices within a country, they are   often described as morality tales with the virtues of Swabian housewives contrasted with the vices of the   Anglo Saxon rakes.    In fact, trade imbalances are natural features of an open system and can be warranted by differences in                                                                                               3   demographics, levels of development and expected paths for income.      3    Savings and investment imbalances will shift with changes in relative prices, including changes in prices of final goods and services,   changes in nominal exchange rates, changes in relative production costs (including unit labour costs), and changes in the costs of trade.   Lags and frictions will mean that different components will shift at varying speeds. This, in turn, can result in large adjustment costs not   present in economic models, which can make a laissez faire approach risky.                                                                                                                                           3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                            3   For example, emerging market economies with young populations and bright prospects should be expected                                                                                                      4   to run large deficits, as Canada did for decades at the turn of the last century. In contrast, rapidly ageing                                                                                                          5   countries should run large surpluses, as confirmed by Bank research (Chart 1).    Chart 1: Demographics and current accounts       Sources: April 2017 WEO and UN.   Notes: The countries labelled in the chart are China (CN), Germany (DE), Japan (JP), the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States   of America (US). The data point for the 2016 current account for the UK has been adjusted to take account of the likely effect of   revisions announced by the ONS, to be incorporated in Blue Book 2017, and erratic movements in trade in non-monetary gold. The   adjustment is based on the average revision in 2011 and 2012 and is applied to the 2016 data published in the 2016 Q4 Balance of   Payments release.    These are �good imbalances,� and we need global trade and financial systems that encourage and facilitate   them.    There are also �bad imbalances� caused by domestic distortions (for example, in the financial or social   welfare systems that affect savings and investment decisions); global deficiencies (such as inadequate   global safety nets which encourage reserve accumulation); or mercantilist and protectionist policies (which   manage trade).    And that is part of what is occurring today, with Japan, Germany and China running excess surpluses   relative to fundamentals; and the US and the UK running excess deficits (Chart 2). And although the euro-   area excess surplus is relatively modest relative to its GDP, in absolute terms it is at least as important as                                               6   those of Japan or China (Chart 3). So while the distortions are few in number, those that exist are large in   scale and systemic in importance.      4     Canadian deficits averaged 8% of GDP in the thirty years before World War I. �Canada in a multi-polar world�, speech by Mark   Carney, 16 May 2011, available at http://www.bankofcanada.ca/2011/05/canada-in-a-multi-polar-world.   5     See Lisack, N., Sajedi, R. and Thwaites, G. �Demographic trends and the real interest rate�, Bank of England Staff Working Paper   forthcoming.   6     Small economies hosting large financial centres like Singapore and Switzerland are special cases for which it is difficult to estimate   �norms�.                                                                                                                                              4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                            4   Chart 2: Actual current account balances and IMF estimates of fundamental balances       Sources: IMF July 2016 External Sector Report, WEO April 2017 and Bank calculations.

First, from the Lawson boom to the Tequila and Global Financial Crises, a common lesson is that large                                                                                                                         7   current account deficits are one of the most trenchant early warning signs of financial instability. This is      7    Blanchard, O. and Milesi-Ferretti, G.M. (2011), �(Why) Should Current Account Balances Be Reduced?�, IMF Staff Discussion Note,   No. 11/03.                                                                                                                                      5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                      5                                                                                                            8   especially true when deficits are accompanied by rapidly growing domestic credit. It is dangerous to rely   entirely on the discipline of the domestic financial system. In each case, the eventual large private losses                                                                           9   weighed on public balance sheets and growth for years.    Second, when imbalances reflect unfair competitive advantage � either through managed trade or managed   exchange rates � they can lead to protectionist backlashes that leave everyone worse off.    And third, in the current environment of synchronised weakness and limited policy space, it is not hard to   imagine this low inflation / low wage / low growth trap being sealed as it was in the 1930s.    In this environment, the UK is running a historically large current account deficit. On the positive side, the   deficit is funded in domestic currency and financial reforms have increased the resilience of the UK system,   thereby making larger imbalances more sustainable. But the UK�s deficit has also been associated with   markedly weak investment and latterly with rapid consumer credit growth. This is not an imbalance that is,   as yet, funding its eventual resolution.    Moreover, despite the large depreciation around the referendum, the extent to which the UK�s deficit has   moved closer to sustainability remains an open question, one whose answer depends crucially on the   outcome of the Brexit negotiations.    Most fundamentally, the UK relies on the kindness of strangers at a time when risks to trade, investment, and   financial fragmentation have increased.    III. Potential Solutions    The world economy has been here before. In the 1930s monetary policy was exhausted and fiscal policy   was in abeyance. The trap was sealed by a wave of protectionist measures originating in the US and   spreading to Europe. As current and capital accounts closed, stagnation ensued.    What should be done to prevent history from rhyming?    In the simple world of the economist, the prescription is straightforward. Deficit countries should loosen                                                                                                             10   monetary policy and tighten fiscal policy. Surplus countries should do the reverse.                            If only the G20 would                                                                                  11   roll up its sleeves, it could easily solve this economic Sudoku.    But such cures are prescribed in the abstract where policy space is unconstrained � a situation far removed   from current realities.    8     Caballero, J. (2014) �Do surges in international capital inflows influence the likelihood of banking crises?� Economic Journal.   9     For example, the IMF estimate that the output cost in Mexico following the Tequila Crisis of 1994-96 was around 14% (Laeven, L. and   Valencia, F. (2012), �Systemic banking crises database: an update�, IMF working paper). For the global financial crisis, the cumulative   loss of global output, when compared to its pre-crisis trend, is of the order of 25% of global output, while for the Lawson boom it is close   to 10% of UK output.   10      More recently, attention has been paid to the need to maintain appropriate macroprudential policies as well as monetary and fiscal.   See, for example, the IMF policy paper (2011) �Macroprudential Policy: An Organizing Framework�.   11      See speech by Mervyn King at the University of Exeter, 19 January 2010, available at   http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/archive/Documents/historicpubs/speeches/2010/speech419.pdf.                                                                                                                                            6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                            6   Monetary policy is still challenged by the lingering risks of a global liquidity trap, with a very low global   equilibrium interest rate, r* � the interest rate central banks must deliver in order to balance demand with   supply and so achieve stable inflation. Colleagues at the Bank estimate that secular forces � which include   demographics, the lower relative price of capital, higher costs of financial intermediation, and inequality �                                                                                                                                 12   have reduced global long-term interest rates by around 4 percentage points since the 1980s.                                        In addition,   cyclical forces since the crisis including high policy uncertainty and hedging of disaster risk are exerting                                                                                                                                13   further drags on private investment, not least through reinforcing the option value of waiting.    Fiscal space is limited in the wake of the financial crisis. And the space that exists is often unevenly                                                                                       14   distributed � with the euro area providing the classic example.                          Given the heavy burden on European   monetary policy, the still sizable amount of slack in the euro area, low European borrowing costs and   aggregate fiscal space, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that if the euro area were a country, fiscal policy   would play a greater role in promoting internal and external balance and the world would be better off   accordingly.    Moreover, as in the 1930s, theoretical remedies are generally falling foul of the real world reluctance of   surplus countries to share the adjustment burden. Unlike deficits, surpluses can be run for a very long time   as they are not hostage to changing preferences of investors and are only gradually affected by their                          15   domestic impact.    For these and other reasons, work at the IMF and the Bank suggests that changing the macro policy mix in                                                                                                                                         16   systemic countries would at best reduce only about one third of their excess imbalances (Chart 4).    Why not just leave the rest to exchange rates? This might prove risky not just because exchange rates tend   to move slowly then significantly, but also because IMF estimates of the required changes are greater than                                                                                         17   have occurred in any year since the collapse of Bretton Woods.       12      See Rachel, L and Smith, T (2015), �Secular drivers of the global real interest rate�, Bank of England Working Paper No. 571.   13      As Ben Broadbent has noted, as uncertainty rises, the option value of waiting also rises � with a simple model suggesting it can add   around 10pp to the hurdle rate that firms need to meet. See �Uncertain times�, speech by Ben Broadbent at the Wall Street Journal,   5 October 2016, available at http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech929.pdf.   14      For example, consider the following comparison between the euro area and the UK. In the euro area, the private sector continues to   generate surplus savings of 5% of GDP. Those must be recycled effectively to generate an expansion. The UK no longer faces that   challenge. Its private sector is in balance. The euro-area unemployment rate of just over 9% is twice that in the UK. Gross general   government debt in the euro area is roughly the same as in the UK and below the average of advanced economies. The weighted   average yield on 10-year euro-area sovereign debt is similar to that in the UK, at close to 1%. And yet, the euro area�s fiscal deficit is   half that in the UK. Its structural deficit, according to the IMF, is around one third as large. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, if the   euro zone were a country, fiscal policy would be substantially more supportive.   15      See Blanchard, O. and Milesi-Ferretti, G.M. (2011), ibid.   16      The macro policies included in the IMF�s analysis are fiscal, credit, foreign exchange reserves, the social safety net (proxied by   spending on health) and capital controls. For Germany, for example, the IMF estimate that only 0.6pp of the assessed 4.8% excess   current account surplus is due to an overly tight domestic policy mix relative to other countries and a further 0.8pp is accounted for by   the policy mix being too loose elsewhere. In China, the IMF analysis indicates a tightening of domestic policies is needed, which would   increase the current account surplus rather than reduce it.

Notes: The countries labelled in the chart are China (CN), Germany (DE), Japan (JP), the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States   of America (US). See the notes to Chart 2 for how excess current account balances are calculated.    And since all countries cannot become more competitive at the same time � it is a relative concept � there is   no avoiding it: higher global growth will require comprehensive measures to boost productivity and with it,   real wages and demand. This means domestic policies to spur innovation, technology adoption, and the   reallocation of resources.                                                                                                        18   Particularly important will be measures to re-start the stalled �diffusion machine�.                     While the most productive   companies have continued to innovate, others have become slower at adopting those innovations.   Speeding up the rate of take-up of new inventions and processes � for example through greater product                                                                                                              19   market competition or challenges to management to benchmark against best practice                               � would provide a   significant boost to overall productivity growth.    And higher growth requires a new approach to trade policy. Consider that Bank of England research   estimates that up to one half of the post-crisis productivity slowdown could be related to the deceleration in                           20   global trade growth.    It will not be enough for the G20 to �resist protectionism.� The G20 now needs to make �trade work for all.�                                                                                                                      21   That includes using e-commerce platforms to promote free trade for SMEs across the G20,                                 and it requires   an urgent and critical examination of trade in services.     18      See https://www.oecd.org/eco/growth/OECD-2015-The-future-of-productivity-book.pdf.   19      See the report written by the Productivity Leadership Group, chaired by Sir Charlie Mayfield, (2016), �How good is your business   really?

IV. Levelling Down or Up: Managed Trade or Free Trade in Services?    One cause of global imbalances is the uneven playing field between trade in goods and services, with                                                                             22   barriers to services trade currently up to three times higher.    Most of the world�s major surplus countries, like Germany and China, are net exporters of goods and benefit   from this asymmetry. Conversely countries with a comparative advantage in services, like the US and UK,   are more likely to run current account deficits (Charts 5 and 6).    Chart 5: Correlation between current account balances and comparative advantage in services       Sources: Barattieri, A. (2014), �Comparative advantage, service trade, and global imbalances�, Journal of International Economics,   Vol. 92, Issue 1, UNCTAD and WEO April 2017.   Notes: The chart shows average current accounts for the 57 largest economies over the decade 2006-2015 against each country�s   share of services in total exports (the higher this share the more comparative advantage in services that country has).       22     Miroudot, S., Sauvage, J. and Shepherd, B. (2013), �Measuring the cost of international trade in services�, World Trade Review, Vol.   12, Issue 4, pp 719-35.                                                                                                                                        9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                      9   Chart 6: Goods and services components of current account balances       Source: WEO April 2017.   Notes: Averages for 2011-2015.    The G20 faces a choice � between levelling down by putting more restrictions on goods trade, or levelling up   by liberalising trade in services.    Evidence from within countries suggests that there may be substantial scope to increase trade in services if   barriers are removed. For example, in Canada � one of the few countries to track trade flows within its   borders � services account for around 50% of all inter-provincial trade compared with only 25% of Canada�s   international exports. If Canada were able to replicate the pattern of trade within its borders with other   countries then services exports would triple.    Reducing restrictions on services trade to the same extent as those on goods have been over the past                                                                                                                                 23   couple of decades could reduce the excess deficits of the US by one third and the UK by one half.    Services liberalisation is also a more efficient form of rebalancing because services industries tend to have   higher domestic value added, and jobs, than manufactured goods. The lower import content of services                                                                                                                                  24   compared with goods means smaller changes are needed to address current account imbalances.                                         For   example, a �10 billion increase in UK financial services exports would reduce the UK�s trade deficit by �9   billion, whereas the same increase in exports of autos would contribute �5� billion.    Of course, liberalising services is not straightforward, as barriers are typically not tariffs but �behind the   border� differences in regulatory standards and trading conditions. This is where global standards and   regulatory cooperation should help.    23      Roughly equal to 15%. These calculations are based on the estimated effects of reducing services trade restrictions on services   exports reported in Nord�s, H.K. and Rouzet, D (2016), �The impact of services trade restrictiveness on trade flows�, The World   Economy, and the estimated mapping between services trade restrictions and services trade costs reported in Miroudot, S. and   Shepherd, B (2016) ibid.   24      In sterling terms. In percentage terms, the changes are larger for services reflecting the fact that they start from a smaller base.                                                                                                                                             10     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                            10   Arguably the greatest possibilities are in financial services given the major progress in financial reform.   Indeed, financial services could serve as a template for broader services trade liberalisation. And with Brexit,   we have the coincidence of necessity and opportunity.    Since the crisis the G20 has agreed a series of new international minimum standards to secure the resilience   of the banking sector, transform shadow-banking into resilient market-based finance, make derivatives   markets safer and end too-big-to fail. Implementation is now being regularly assessed and transparently   reported by the FSB and IMF. The playing field for cross-border activities is being levelled.    At the same time, supervisory cooperation has intensified. Information is now readily shared through   supervisory colleges. And regular crisis management groups for systemic firms are building confidence in   how authorities will behave when things go wrong.    In short, platforms are being created for deference to each other�s approaches when they achieve similar   outcomes. With robust standards consistently applied, wholesale financial services could be brought more   fully into bilateral trade agreements, keeping the global financial system open and resilient, and supporting   greater trade, investment and innovation.    Let me use a specific example of CCPs in London � although my points apply more generally and   reciprocally to all critical cross-border financial market infrastructure in the UK and Europe.    Prior to the crisis, derivative transactions created a complex, opaque � and dangerous � web of exposures   that helped turn a shock into a panic.    With the G20�s encouragement, CCPs are now helping to untangle this web and build resilience. Moreover,   by netting exposures across counterparties, currencies and products; CCPs are supporting more liquid   markets and are lowering costs to end users. That means more resilient financing and better risk   management for business and households.    The UK houses some of the world�s largest CCPs. For example, LCH in London clears swaps in 18   currencies for firms in 55 jurisdictions, handling over 90% of cleared interest rate swaps globally and 98% of   all cleared swaps in euros. All currencies, products and counterparties benefit from the resulting economies   of scale and scope.    Fragmentation of such global markets by jurisdiction or currency would reduce the benefits of central   clearing. EU27 firms account for only a quarter of global activity in cleared euro interest rate swaps, and   about 14% of total interest rate swaps in all currencies cleared by LCH. Any development which prevented   EU27 firms from continuing to clear trades in the UK would split liquidity between a less liquid onshore   market for EU firms and a more liquid offshore market for everyone else.                                                                                                                       11     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                  11   The potential for higher costs is not theoretical. In Japan, for example, where the clearing of yen-   denominated swaps by certain Japanese firms must take place onshore, the difference in price between the   onshore and offshore markets has generally been in the range of 1-3 basis points.    Such seemingly small price differences translate into significant costs for users given the scale of activity in   these markets. Industry estimates suggest that a single basis point increase in the cost resulti"

Peak to trough, the   level of UK business investment fell by 20%, and it was six years before it surpassed its pre-crisis level,   putting the recent experience at the bottom of the swathe of past UK cycles (Chart 2).    In my brief remarks today, I will offer some possible explanations for this performance before concluding with   comments on the outlooks for UK investment and monetary policy.    I. Investment since the crisis    In part, weak investment reflects a weak economy, with the recovery following the crash being the slowest   since the Great Depression.    Weakness in demand is not, however, the whole explanation. Business investment has underperformed   relative to output since the crisis, with the ratio of the two falling in the UK by around 2 percentage points in   the immediate aftermath (Chart 3), similar to the experience in other advanced economies.                                                                                                                                    1   Falls in investment tend to be more persistent for recessions associated with financial crises (Chart 4). This   partly reflects restrictions in credit supply constraining investment, as well as productivity, wages and                                                    2   economic performance more generally.    But weak UK investment also reflected a necessary adjustment in the capital stock. That overhang � which   peaked at close to 10% in the UK � is being gradually worked off through a combination of a recovery in   output and a prolonged period of subdued net investment (Chart 5).    And in part weak investment could reflect a misallocation of capital in the run-up to the crisis. In this regard,   the situation in the UK was a bit different to that in countries such as Spain and the US where significant   residential and commercial property construction booms subsequently turned to busts. Without a housing   glut to work off, the weakness of UK investment is all the more striking.    Another form of misallocation could be the ability of so-called zombie firms to live on in the very low interest   rate environment. The BIS�s proxy for this has seen the share of the �living dead� more than double since              3   the crisis. In contrast, the Bank of England estimates that the proportion of zombie firms in the UK has   fallen by a quarter since 2008 (Chart 6).       1     See, for example, Reinhart, C. and K. Rogoff. 2009. This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly. Princeton: Princeton   University Press, and Jorda, O., Schularick, M. and Taylor, A. (2013), �When Credit Bites Back�, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking,   Vol. 45, Issue s2.   2     Bank research (Franklin, Rostom and Thwaites, 2016), finds that the reduction in bank credit supply had an economically and   statistically significant effect on companies: a 10% fall in the amount a firm could borrow is estimated to have reduced capital per   worker by around 5-6%, labour productivity by 5-8% and wages by 7-9%, and increased the probability of bankruptcy by around 60%.   3     See page 52 of the Bank for International Settlements 87th Annual Report, available at http://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2017e.htm.   Zombie firms are defined as those with a ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest expenses below one, with the firm aged   10 years or more.                                                                                                                                        2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                       2                                                                                           4   Increased uncertainty has undoubtedly contributed to weak investment. Confirming the adage that bad   things come in threes, companies have faced uncertainty about the economy, geopolitics, and economic                                                                                                                              5   policy, all of which are likely to have clouded the outlook for how investments will perform (Chart 7).    Greater uncertainty about returns means that fewer investment projects will be seen as worthwhile. This   could help explain the �puzzle� of why hurdle rates in business investment have remained stubbornly high   despite the weaker secular outlook for growth implied, for example, by long-term bond yields. The answer   may be that the expected volatility of earnings growth has increased. As an illustration, a simple Black �   Scholes model suggests that the hurdle rate for expected returns is high � in the region of 10 percentage                      6   points (Chart 8) �consistent with survey evidence for the UK (Chart 9). A 10-percentage point pick up in the   volatility of expected earnings could almost double that rate, swamping the impact of lower risk-free returns.    All of these explanations concern the legacy effects of the crisis, but secular forces may also be at work. For   example, over the past thirty years investment has shifted from fixed assets towards intangibles � such as                                                                                               7   computer software, intellectual property, and research and development. This may have dampened the   traditional investment accelerator. Increases in demand are usually accelerated by increases in investment   � higher demand boosts companies� profits, increasing their net worth and so allowing them to undertake   further investment, as well as stimulating incomes and spending further. A wide range of analysis suggests   that the shift towards intangibles has, however, dampened this effect, perhaps because intangible assets are                                                                                               8   less suitable for use as collateral than physical assets, such as property.    The weakness in investment is of course linked to weak productivity. In the UK, while the most productive   companies have continued to innovate, others have become slower at adopting those innovations. That has   stalled diffusion of productivity gains through the economy (Chart 10). This shortfall in investment could   reflect deeper causes such as inadequate competition, barriers to investment in knowledge-based capital                                                  9   and sub-optimal managerial practices.       4     Identifying the effect of increased uncertainty is complicated by the fact that it is usually accompanied by a tightening in financial   conditions. In this regard, the pickup in uncertainty following the referendum on EU membership in the UK was unusual, as financial   conditions eased, helped by a series of monetary and macro-financial policy measures taken by the Bank of England.   5     �Uncertainty, the economy and policy�, speech given by Mark Carney, 30 June 2016, available at   http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech915.pdf.   6     For individual firms, the standard variation of annual earnings was around 30 percentage points in the period before the crisis. See   �Uncertain times�, speech by Ben Broadbent at the Wall Street Journal, 5 October 2016, available at   http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech929.pdf.   7     For example, estimates by the Bank for International Settlements suggest that between 1990 and 2016, the investment rate in fixed   assets declined from around 8% to 3�% of total assets, while the investment rate in intangible assets increased from around 7% in   1990 to 10% in 2016.   8     Various papers find evidence that intangibles investment is less responsive to changes in demand than investment in fixed assets. For   example, Masayuki (2015) estimates an accelerator-type investment model, where growth of the firm�s sales is included as regressor,   together with a measure of cash flow. The estimated �accelerator� coefficient is small and not statistically significant for intangible   investment, suggesting this effect might be absent. Estimates from regression analysis by BIS show that the sensitivity of investment to   investment opportunities (proxied by Tobin�s Q) is approximately three times more sensitive for physical investment than for intangible   investment � a result that the BIS suggest could be explained by �the structural lumpiness of intangible investment�. In a similar vein,   Ryan and Taylor (2017) also find that intangible capital responds more slowly to changes in investment opportunities. They conclude   that, compared with physical capital, intangible capital�s convex adjustment costs are roughly twice as large.   9      See https://www.oecd.org/eco/growth/OECD-2015-The-future-of-productivity-book.pdf.                                                                                                                                       3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                        3   Although these secular forces may likely persist, many of the conditions for a revival in business investment   are now in place.    II. The Contribution of Central Banks to Investment    Recognising that the most important contributions will be from structural policies, how can central banks   support that belated investment recovery?    First, we must acknowledge that, while the cost and availability of finance matters; internal cash flows, the   profit outlook and uncertainty are far more important determinants of investment. Monetary policy affects   companies� profits and cash flows through its effects on domestic demand and, via the exchange rate,   external demand. Given the importance of internal finance for investment, and the high hurdle rates   investment projects must clear, such indirect effects are more important for investment than the direct effects   on the cost of capital. The biggest contributions of central banks are therefore improving the demand and   profit outlooks and reducing uncertainty.    Allow me to use the current situation in the UK to illustrate these points.    UK output is now in sight of potential, and the capital overhang looks set to be eliminated over the next few   years. In order to expand, companies will increasingly need to invest.    A strengthening global economy should tempt UK companies to do so, particularly since UK companies are   generally competitive given the recent fall in sterling. Indeed, the broad-based global recovery is creating the   possibility of a self-reinforcing revival in investment. The Bank of England estimates that more than 80% of   the world economy is now growing above potential. Global measures of industrial production and capital   goods orders, as well as world trade, have strengthened markedly over the past year, suggesting some   rotation in the composition of global demand towards investment. With that more favourable outlook,   investment intentions are now rising around the world (Chart 11).    If these intentions are realised, the global equilibrium interest rate could rise somewhat, making a given   policy setting more accommodative. The extent to which it does will depend on other secular factors that                                                                                                                                             10   have been holding it down, including demographics, debt overhangs and the capital intensity of production.    In this generally constructive environment, the main issues facing UK companies are uncertainties � about   how consumers will adjust to a period of weaker real income growth; about market access post-Brexit; about                                                                                                                         11   the potential risks in the transition to new arrangements with the EU and the rest of the world.                           In this      10      See Rachel, L and Smith, T (2015), �Secular drivers of the global real interest rate�, Bank of England Working Paper No. 571 and   �Resolving the climate paradox�, speech by Mark Carney at the Arthur Burns Memorial Lecture, Berlin, 22 September 2016, available at   http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech923.pdf.   11      Among companies responding to the Bank�s Decision Maker Panel survey between February and April 2017, Brexit was the largest   current source of uncertainty for 10%, one of the top two or three sources of uncertainty for 30%, one of many drivers of uncertainty four   40% and not important for the remaining 20%.                                                                                                                                         4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                            4   context, the best contribution the Bank of England can make is maintaining financial and monetary stability   by pursuing the right policies within consistent frameworks.    In recent years, the Bank has been determined to remove any lingering uncertainties that companies may   have about access to finance in good times and bad. The Bank is building the resilience of the financial   system through much higher capital levels, more prudent underwriting standards, rigorous stress testing and   appropriate contingency planning. The core tier 1 capital ratios for major UK banks are now almost 14%   (Chart 12). Yesterday, the FPC increased the countercyclical capital buffer rate to 0.5% from 0%, announced   higher expectations of lenders� underwriting standards for consumer credit, and recalibrated the leverage   ratio. With detailed contingency planning for the financial stability impacts of Brexit, UK companies can be   confident of continued access to finance in an uncertain world.    Reforms mean the UK financial system is working well. Net lending to private companies is been growing   following six years of contraction. Corporate bond spreads are well below their long-run averages   (Chart 13). And credit conditions among SMEs have been steadily improving.    If the opportunities present themselves, UK corporates could readily draw on this finance as their balance   sheets are in good health following a decade of de-levering to ratios amongst the lowest in advanced                    12   economies.    Turning now to monetary policy, the Bank operates within an established framework, anchored in the   inflation target (Chart 14). The MPC set out in advance of the referendum how it would apply that   framework, emphasising that the effects of the process of leaving the EU on inflation would depend on its   impact on demand, supply and the exchange rate. The Committee has repeatedly stressed that, as a result,   the implications for monetary policy would not be automatic.    The MPC has also clearly set out its reaction function consistent with its remit. Under the exceptional   circumstances Brexit entails (with an inflation overshoot driven entirely by an exchange rate depreciation   caused a large fundamental shock), the Committee is required by its remit to balance a period of above-   target inflation with a period of weaker growth. As the primary objective of monetary policy remains inflation   control, any overshoot of inflation above the target can only be temporary in nature and limited in scope. As   such, the MPC has been clear that its tolerance for above-target inflation is limited.    Since the prospect of Brexit emerged, financial markets, notably sterling, have marked down the UK�s   economic prospects. Monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely to accompany the   transition to new trading arrangements with the EU. But it can influence how this hit to incomes is distributed   between job losses and price rises. And it can support households and businesses as they adjust to such   profound change.      12        See the statistical annex to the Bank for International Settlements 87th Annual Report, ibid.                                                                                                                  5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                5   As spare capacity erodes, the trade-off that the MPC must balance lessens, and, all else equal, its tolerance   for above-target inflation falls (Chart 15). Different members of the MPC will understandably have different   views about the outlook and therefore the potential timing of any Bank Rate increase. But all expect that any   changes would be limited in scope and gradual in pace.    When the MPC last met earlier this month, my view was that given the mixed signals on consumer spending   and business investment, it was too early to judge with confidence how large and persistent the slowdown in   growth would prove. Moreover, with domestic inflationary pressures, particularly wages and unit labour   costs, still subdued, it was appropriate to leave the policy stance unchanged at that time.    Some removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary if the trade-off facing the MPC continues   to lessen and the policy decision accordingly becomes more conventional. The extent to which the trade-off   moves in that direction will depend on the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other   components of demand including business investment, whether wages and unit labour costs begin to firm,   and more generally, how the economy reacts to both tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit   negotiations. These are some of the issues that the MPC will debate in the coming months.    III. Conclusion    After an expansion that has relied overly on consumption, the rotation to other components of demand,   particularly investment, will be important to sustain momentum. Stronger investment will support productivity   growth, stronger wages and higher welfare for all.    It will also give monetary policy more traction. Globally, there are signs that such a rotation may be   beginning. Although some UK�specific uncertainties might limit the UK�s participation in that pickup, the   Bank of England will make its contribution by pursuing determined policies within well-established   frameworks in order to maintain monetary and financial stability.                                                                                                                   6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                             6   Chart 1: G4 non-residential investment weak since the crisis                                                                                         Percentage changes since 2007                                                                                                                  15                United Kingdom               United States                                                                                                                           10                Euro area                    Japan                                                                                                                           5                                                                                                                            0                                                                                                                            -5                                                                                                                            -10                                                                                                                            -15                                                                                                                           -20    2007         2008        2009         2010         2011        2012         2013        2014          2015        2016    Sources: Eurostat, ONS, OECD and Bank of England calculations.

2017-07-24	"Opening remarks at the �10 note launch   Speech given by   Mark Carney   Governor of the Bank of England       Winchester Cathedral   Tuesday 18 July 2017                                                                             1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches   I would like to express my gratitude to Dean Catherine Ogle for her generosity in hosting this event in the   magnificent Winchester Cathedral.    There can be no better place to unveil the new �10 banknote, featuring Jane Austen, and there can be no                                         th   better time than today, the 200 anniversary of her death. This building, admired by Austen herself,   commemorates her legacy and has become a place of pilgrimage for her admirers. The inscription on her   grave, in the north aisle of the Nave of the Cathedral, attests to her character: �The benevolence of her   heart, the sweetness of her temper, and the extraordinary endowments of her mind obtained the regard of all   who knew her and the warmest love of her intimate connections�. A brass plaque on the wall alongside   recognises her many writings. And the memorial window above them all, paid for by public subscription,   testifies to the popularity and enduring appeal of her work. An appeal which draws a regular procession of   tourists from all over the world.    Banknote character                                                                                                                              1   �10 would have meant a lot to Jane Austen � about the same as �1000 would mean to us today. �10 was   half the annual allowance she received from her father while he was alive. A �10 note may also have had a   symbolic meaning to her, as it was the amount she was paid by publishers Crosby and Co. for her first novel,            2   Susan.    Just as a �10 banknote might have evoked memories for Jane Austen, so does money serve as a collective                                                                                                                         3   memory for a country and its people. Our banknotes have cultural as well as economic value. Through the   characters on our banknotes, we celebrate the breadth and depth of achievement across the United   Kingdom, in fields ranging from literature to the visual arts, science and statecraft.    Once she replaces Charles Darwin on the �10 banknote this September, Jane Austen will sit alongside   Winston Churchill on the new �5, Adam Smith on the �20, and Boulton and Watt on the �50. Around the   end of the decade, Smith will be replaced on the �20 by JMW Turner. These individuals have advanced   British thought, spurred innovation, exerted exceptional leadership, and more generally helped to shape this   diverse society and forge our common values.                                                                            4   As the �mother of the great tradition of the English novel�, Jane Austen�s place in this august group is   assured. Sir Walter Scott�s praise for Austen�s �talent for describing the involvement and feelings and   characters of ordinary life which is to me the most wonderful I ever met with� is a sentiment that those   reading her work today would recognise and endorse.       1     Based on the increase in the general price level since 1775, �10 at the time of Austen�s birth would be equivalent to �1120 in 2016.   See Thomas, R and Dimsdale, N (2017) ""A Millennium of UK Data"", Bank of England OBRA dataset,   http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Pages/onebank/threecenturies.aspx.   2     Crosby and Co. subsequently decided against publication, and sold it back for the same price. Jane revised the novel, retitling it   Northanger Abbey. It was published posthumously in December 1817.   3     In economic terms, money serves three values: it is facilitates trade, stores value and provides a unit of account.   4     F.R.

Indeed, in using her writing to highlight the barriers placed by society to the independence of   women, she was ahead of her time. �Give a girl an education and introduce her properly into the world, and                                                                                             5   ten to one but she has the means of settling well, without further expense to anybody.�    For an author who received some critical praise but little recognition during her brief lifetime, the reach of her                                                                                                              6   work today might have been a surprise. Austen�s books have been translated into over 40 languages.   There have been countless film and television adaptations. And her stories have served as the inspiration   for new fiction, ranging from faithful imaginations of the future lives of Austen�s characters (Death Comes to   Pemberley by PD James) to modern re-workings (Bridget Jones�s Diary by Helen Fielding) and even more   fanciful retellings that feature the living dead (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies by Seth Grahame-Smith).    Banknote design    What might Jane Austen have made of the new �10 note had she been able to join us today?    She might not have immediately recognised it as money. Banknotes have changed almost beyond   recognition since Jane received her �10 for Susan. Back then, the Bank of England was issuing partly   printed notes for completion in manuscript. The � sign and the first digit were printed but other numerals   were added by hand, as were the name of the payee, the cashier�s signature, the date and the number.   Notes could be for uneven amounts � it wasn�t until 1745 that notes were part printed with set   denominations, with the first �10 issued only 18 years before Austen�s birth. You can see an example of a   note that Austen may have received on the screen behind me.    Remarkably, the new �10 is not the first banknote on which the Austen name has appeared. That award   must go to Jane�s brother Henry. Henry was, for a time, a banker, with interests in Hampshire and London.   In the Austens� times, many banks were small and local, and could issue their own banknotes. And so it was   with Henry. The British Museum holds a �10 note from Henry Austen�s bank in Alton.    The images of people on Bank of England banknotes are a recent addition. The monarch did not generally   appear prior to 1960 and it was another decade until the first character � another great of English literature,   William Shakespeare � was included.    Even more unusually, the new �10 joins the �5 in being printed on polymer, rather than paper. Polymer   marks a major innovation. It is cleaner, safer and stronger. Resistant to dirt, moisture and curry.    This added strength means notes will remain in good condition for longer, with a lifespan at least two and a   half times that of paper notes. When they do reach the end of their useful lives, polymer notes will be   recycled. As a result, the costs of producing notes � both economic and environmental � are lower.     5       Mansfield Park (1814).   6       http://libraryguides.goucher.edu/c.php?g=242484&p=1612598.                                                                                                                  3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                  3   Importantly, the use of polymer also allows the Bank to bolster the security features in our banknotes. The   new �10 features see-through panels, coloured foils and detailed metallic images.    The design of the new �10 makes full use of polymer�s potential. It features a portrait of Jane Austen, taken   from an engraving by William Home Lizars, commissioned in 1870 by her nephew and based on a                                                             7   watercolour sketch by her sister Cassandra.    To the side are two further images celebrating Austen�s work: an illustration of Miss Elizabeth Bennet                                                                                                         8   undertaking �The examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her�; and an image of   Godmersham Park, home of Austen�s brother, Edward Austen Knight, and believed to be the inspiration for a   number of her novels.    The central design in the background of the note is inspired by the twelve-sided writing table and writing   quills used by Austen at Chawton cottage, where she lived and wrote most of her novels. Also included is a                                                                                                                      9   quote from Pride and Prejudice � �I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!�    As Austen�s final resting place, this building � Winchester Cathedral � is also commemorated in the note,   featuring in the foil.    The Bank of England is committed to ensuring our banknotes recognise the diversity of their users not only   through the characters represented but also through their ease of use. That is why we are introducing a new   tactile feature on the �10 to help the visually impaired: a series of dots in the upper left-hand corner. These   dots join existing features, such as differing colour palettes and raised print, that enable those who are blind                                                                                                                                               10   and visually impaired to recognise different notes, ensuring the nation�s money is as inclusive as possible.    This short video illustrates these and other features of the note.    Conclusion    Our banknotes serve as repositories of the country�s collective memory, promoting awareness of the United   Kingdom� glorious history and highlighting the contributions of its greatest citizens. That tradition continues   with the new �10.    As Austen herself advised us �You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its   remembrance gives you pleasure.� Today, we look forward to the launch of the new �10 note, graced by   Jane Austen, as we look back to her life and celebrate the joy she has brought, and is yet to bring, to all   those who read her work.     7     The advantage of using the engraving, rather than the original portrait, is that it has sufficient detail that it can be used without requiring   any alterations to the image.   8     This image is from a drawing by Isabel Bishop (1902-1988), who illustrated E.

Dutton & Company�s 1976 edition of Pride and   Prejudice.   9     Miss Bingley, Chapter XI.   10      Other features of Bank of England banknotes that aid the visually impaired include the tiered sizing of different denominations and   bold numerals.                                                                                                                                                4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                                 4"

Introduction    During his term as Managing Director, Michel Camdessus oversaw the second great wave of globalisation.   The Berlin Wall fell, capital controls were liberalised, the euro was constructed, and China prepared to join   the WTO. Product and financial markets became increasingly integrated, with trade growing at an annual   rate of 10% and capital flows of 20%. The effective global labour force doubled, and more than a billion   people were lifted out of poverty.    Central banks are now grappling with one consequence of such enormous achievements � the impact of   globalisation on inflation.    All central banks must consider the cyclical relationship between global slack and domestic inflation; the   degree to which secular forces from globalisation affect local inflation dynamics; and how global factors   influence the stance of domestic monetary policy itself. And now some central banks may need to consider   the implications for price stability if the process of globalisation were to slow or go into reverse.    These issues are particularly relevant to the Bank of England as the UK inflation outlook will be importantly   influenced for some time by a process of de-integration under Brexit.    Today, I would like to draw on this example to illustrate how global factors influence domestic inflation   dynamics and the ability of central banks to achieve price stability.    II. Globalisation and Inflation    While the global Phillips Curve appears alive and well (Chart 1), globalisation has been accompanied by a                                                                                                              1   weakening in the relationship between domestic slack and domestic inflation (Chart 2), and by a   corresponding strengthening in the relationship between global forces and domestic prices.       1     As summarised by the slope coefficients in price and wage Phillips curves. The wage and price Phillips curves had already flattened   during the 1970s and �80s, most likely linked � as Rogoff argued � to the institutional reforms made to monetary policy during that   period. The finding of flattening Phillips curves has been widely documented. For example, Blanchard, O, Cerutti, E and Summers, L   (2015), �Inflation and Activity � Two Explorations and their Monetary Policy Implications�, NBER Working Paper No. 21762, find that the   median Phillips curve slope of 20 advanced and emerging economies fell by more than half between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s,   from around 1 to around 0.3.                                                                                                                                       2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                       2   Chart 1: Global Price Phillips Curve?

Chart 2: Price and Wage Phillips curves have flattened throughout globalisation       Source: BIS 87th Annual Report.    With correlations of headline CPI inflation rates as elevated today as during the first oil shock (Chart 3a),   some contend that global forces have become dominant � a conviction reinforced by the �missing                                                                   2,3   disinflations� in the wake of the global financial crisis             and by the current series of wage puzzles in    2     See, for example, Chapter 3 of the IMF�s WEO April 2013, �The dog that didn�t bark: has inflation been muzzled or was it just   sleeping?�.   3     One explanation put forward for this, unrelated to globalisation, is that companies facing liquidity constraints maintained prices at   higher levels than they would otherwise have done in order to preserve cash flows and remain in operation. See Gilchrist, S, Schoenle,   R, Sim, J and Zakraj�ek, E (2017), �Inflation dynamics during the financial crisis�, American Economic Review, Vol. 107, No. 3, pages                                                                                                                                       3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                       3                               4   advanced economies. There are even suggestions that monetary policy frameworks should be overhauled                                                                                                               5   � potentially lowering the inflation target � in response globalisation�s growing impact.

Sources: Thomson Reuters Datastream, National Sources and Bank calculations.    Some perspective is required.    Wage puzzles in advanced economies can be partly solved by recognising that post-crisis structural reforms   have lowered natural rates of unemployment, by broadening measures of labour market slack to include   involuntary underemployment, and by acknowledging that weak wages are one consequence of sustained                                   6   poor productivity growth.    More broadly, the recent high correlations of headline inflation rates have been driven by very large global   shocks including the financial crisis and the commodity super cycle. Core inflation rates have actually   exhibited little co-movement but rather have varied with (divergent) underlying economic conditions (Chart   3b).       785-823. Consistent with this, analysis by Bank staff found that UK businesses with weaker balance sheets increased their margins by   more at the height of the crisis than those with healthier balance sheets.   4     For example, as documented by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in their 87th Annual Report, 2017. See also Draghi, M   (2017), �Accompanying the economic recovery�, introductory speech at the ECB Forum on Central Banking 2017 and Danninger, S   (2016) �What�s up with U.S. wage growth and job mobility�, IMF Working Paper 16/122.   5     For example, as suggested by Claude Borio, �How much do we really know about inflation?�, Presentation on the BIS 87 th Annual   Report, 25 June 2017.   6     See, for example, the boxes on pages 18-20 of the February 2017 Inflation Report and page 29 of the May 2014 Inflation Report. The   solutions to these puzzles are also likely to involve some factors unrelated to globalisation. For example, one explanation put forward   for missing dis-inflation is that companies facing liquidity constraints maintained prices at higher levels than they would otherwise have   done in order to preserve cash flows and remain in operation (see Gilchrist, S, Schoenle, R, Sim, J and Zakraj�ek, E (2017), ibid).   Consistent with this, analysis by Bank staff found that UK businesses with weaker balance sheets increased their margins by more at   the height of the crisis than those with healthier balance sheets).                                                                                                                                          4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                          4   Chart 3b: Core inflation rates exhibited little co-movement post-crisis       See notes and sources to Chart 3a.    Central banks have (thus far) been able to maintain their monetary sovereignty, achieving their mandates by   offsetting the secular disinflationary forces from global integration.    None of this, however, is to downplay current challenges of maintaining price stability in the face of global   forces. The combination of the growing contestability of markets and prolonged synchronised weak demand   may be restraining wage expectations. Moreover, technological changes, particularly those which could   globalise markets for many services, may extend and deepen trend global disinflation. And, the global   financial cycle could exacerbate the challenges of returning domestic inflation to target, particularly given the   proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound.    Charting a path for monetary policy in this environment thus requires a nuanced understanding of how   globalisation both affects inflation and influences the stance of monetary policy. It is to these I will now turn.    Global Influences on Domestic Inflation    In a closed economy, inflationary pressures depend on developments in domestic costs, which in turn   depend on domestic spare capacity, or the balance of domestic supply and demand.    Opening up the economy changes this relationship in three ways.                                                                                                                       5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                  5   Most straightforwardly, external demand exerts pressure on domestic resource utilisation and therefore   domestic inflation. The importance of this channel has steadily increased for most of the past half century                7   (Chart 4).    Chart 4: External demand has steadily increased in importance       Sources: IMF and Bank calculations.    Next, in an open economy, prices of imports affect domestic inflation both directly � through the final goods   and services bought by households � and indirectly � through the prices of imported intermediates used in   the production of final goods and services in the consumption basket.    For years the direct effect has imparted a steady disinflationary bias. The integration of lower-cost producers   into the global economy acts like an increase in potential supply for advanced economies, raising the level of                                                                    8   spending that is consistent with inflation at target. Thus far, this disinflationary effect has mostly affected the                       9                                                                                                                     10   prices of goods (Chart 5), as trade in goods has been liberalised to a much greater extent than services.   Monetary policy makers in advanced economies have responded by accommodating relatively higher   services price inflation in order to meet their inflation objectives. For example, in the UK core goods prices   fell an average of 0.3% over the past two decades, services prices rose by an average of 3.4% and total CPI                                               11   inflation was on average at target.     7     The slowing of trade growth since the financial crisis largely reflects the rotation of global growth to countries with less import intensive   demand, notably the US and EMEs, as well as the declining import intensity of final domestic demand in China as the composition of   growth there rotates towards consumption and services.   8     This positive supply shock comes about because the availability of cheap imports improves advanced economies� terms of trade � the   price of exports relative to that of imports. For more detail on this channel, see �Globalisation and Inflation�, speech given by Charles   Bean at the LSE, 24 October 2006.   9     Abdih, Y, Balakrishnan, R and Shang, B (2016) �What is keeping US core inflation low?�, IMF Working Paper No. 16/124.   10      For example, barriers to services trade are estimated currently to be up to three times higher than those for goods trade. See �A fine   balance�, speech by Mark Carney at the Mansion House, 20 June 2017.   11      Headline CPI inflation averaged 1.9% over this period.                                                                                                                                               6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                               6   Chart 5: Sustained, cumulative relative price shock in goods accommodated through higher   services price inflation       Notes: Six-month average of the log-difference between core goods prices (excludes food and energy) and services prices (series   indexed; 2005 = 100).

Globalisation has also led to a dramatic increase in the use of imported intermediates in domestic   production. The ICT revolution has made a great unbundling of production into global value chains possible,   and large wage differentials have made doing so profitable. Intermediate goods trade has represented 80%   of the increase in total trade over the past two decades (Chart 6), driving up the value added of imports as a                                                                            12   share from 10% of exports in 1990 to around 20% in 2015.       12    See Auer, R, Borio, C and Filardo, A (2017), �The globalisation of inflation: the growing importance of global value chains�, BIS   Working Paper No. 602.                                                                                                                                        7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                      7   Chart 6: The development of global value chains has boosted trade in intermediates       Notes: Imports and GDP are in current US dollars.   Sources: Johnson and Noguera (forthcoming), Powell (2016), World Input-Output Database (2016 release) and BIS.    This expansion in global value chains has led to greater synchronisation of producer price inflation across                13   countries.        And it has increased the sensitivity of domestic inflation to global inflationary pressures while                                                                             14   reducing its responsiveness to changes in domestic slack.                      Research by the BIS indicates that a doubling   in the share of imported intermediates in GDP causes the importance of global factors for domestic inflation                          15   to double as well.          Consistent with that, research at the Bank of England indicates that each 1 percentage   point increase in the import intensity of consumption reduces the sensitivity of inflation to domestic slack by 1   per cent, and that the strength of this effect varies with the ease with which producers can switch between                                                                  16   imported intermediates and domestic alternatives.    Monetary policy makers must take the effects of intermediate trade into account since, unlike commodity   shocks, import price changes take time to work through supply chains into final goods prices and therefore                                                           17   affect inflation at the policy-relevant horizon.    Labour markets provide a third channel through which globalisation affects domestic inflation. To be clear,   globalisation is far from the only factor that has been affecting labour markets in recent decades � and   13       Auer, R, Levchenko, A and Saur�, P (2017), �International inflation spillovers through input linkages�, NBER Working Paper No.   23246. A shock that raises inflation by 1 percentage point in the rest of the world is found to raise domestic producer price inflation by   (PPI) 0.2pp on average across the countries in the sample. The size of the effect varies significantly across countries, however; the UK   is a little below average.   14      This depends, of course, on whether the good/service in the supply chain is sold on to become a final good/service in the same   country or exported.   15      This is true both across countries and over time. See Auer, R, Borio, C and Filardo, A (2017), ibid.   16      See Cesa-Bianchi, A, Kindberg-Hanlon, G, Nelson, B and Thwaites, G, Bank of England, forthcoming. The speed at which changes   in import prices are passed through to final goods is likely to differ across products. For example, for the UK, consumer food and   energy prices appear to respond more quickly than the prices of other goods and services. In part, that appears to be because margins   at each point in the supply chain are tight. For food, it also partly reflects the fact some imported food is already the final consumption   good � i.e. the supply chain is short.   17      See Goldberg, L and Campa, J (2010), �The sensitivity of the CPI to exchange rates: distribution margins, imported inputs, and trade   exposure�, The Review of Economics and Statistics, Vol. 92, Issue 2, pages 392-407.                                                                                                                                          8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                           8                                                                     18   arguably, as work by the IMF and others has shown,                     technological progress has played a more significant   role. Technology, not globalisation, is estimated to be the main reason why labour�s share of income has   been falling across advanced economies.    But that does not mean global effects are absent.    The doubling of the effective global labour pool represents a huge, positive supply shock for the global   economy. It has encouraged the shift of the production of goods and services that use lower-skilled labour   intensively to countries with an abundance of lower-skilled workers � predominantly emerging market   economies � while production of goods and services requiring more highly skilled labour has concentrated in   countries with a greater share of higher skilled labour � predominantly advanced economies. The growing                                                                                                                                  19   ability to split production components and tasks through global value chains has amplified this effect.    Globalisation has also increased the contestability of labour markets, weakening the extent to which slack in                                                                                        20   domestic labour markets influences domestic inflationary pressures.                       That is, the increased ease with which   activities can be off-shored or domestic vacancies filled by sourcing workers from abroad may have reduced   the relative bargaining power and wage expectations of workers. While it is difficult to measure precisely,                                                                                                21   available evidence suggests that contestability effects could be significant.                       Greater openness appears to                                                                                                  22   have reduced the sensitivity of wages to domestic labour market conditions                          and led to growth in domestic                                                                                                 23   unit labour costs (ULCs) becoming more closely tied to global ULC growth.    Overall, the greater global supply of labour has lowered the relative wages of lower-skilled workers in   advanced economies. While this reduces inflationary pressures in the economy as a whole it has                                                                                                        24   contributed to a long and painful period of adjustment for lower-skilled workers.                         The secular disinflationary   effects from this steady integration of additional workers into the global labour market need to be taken into   account in addition to the cyclical inflationary pressures from changes in labour market slack.    The various channels through which globalisation affects the relationship between domestic slack and   inflation can be illustrated using the Phillips Curve (Figure 1).       18      See �Understanding the downward trend in labour income shares�, Chapter 3 of IMF WEO April 2017.   19      These effects � an example of factor price equalisation (Samuelson, 1948) � have been well documented for example by Autor, D,   Dorn, D and Hanson, G (2015), �Untangling Trade and Technology: Evidence from Local Labour Markets�, The Economic Journal, Vol.   125, No. 584, pages 621-46. Bank staff analysis, using OECD data, suggests this mechanism has operated widely, with a range of   countries seeing strong growth in non-tradeable employment compensate for declines in sectors most exposed to international labour   substitution.   20      This channel also increases the role of the exchange rate in determining inflationary pressures, since it will affect the home-currency   value of the wage workers from abroad would earn by relocating and therefore their willingness to move.   21      For example, for the US, Blinder, A (2009) �How many US jobs might be offshorable?� World Economics Volume 10 Issue 2, estimates   that the potential to offshore service sectors jobs may have lowered wages by up to 14%. Arseneau, D and Leduc, S (2011),   �Threatening to offshore in a search model of the labor market� build contestability into a two-country model and find it can reduce wages   by up to 5% in the source country.   22      Rotunno, L and Wood, A (2016), �Wage inequality and skill supplies in a globalised world�, Aix-Marseille School of Economics Working   Paper.   23      BIS 87th Annual Report, ibid.   24      As noted above, technological changes have played a greater role in driving down the relative wages of less skilled workers.                                                                                                                                         9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                          9   Figure 1: Effects of globalisation on the Phillips curve       Changes in external demand will cause a shift along the Phillips Curve, as domestic companies adjust   capacity utilisation in response (1).    The series of positive supply shocks from increased product and labour market integration cause parallel   shifts down in the Phillips Curve (2). These downward shifts will persist as long as integration continues.   This may take a while, not least because the advent of digital platforms may extend these processes to a                                                                         25   much broader range of goods and services markets.                          The domestic economy needs to be run with tighter   spare capacity to accommodate these disinflationary effects.    The increased competitive forces from globalisation (both actual and contestable) have also acted through   product and labour markets to decrease the responsiveness of inflation to domestic slack, flattening the   Phillips Curve slope (3).    Monetary policy must take all these effects into account and, on balance, run the domestic economy with   tighter spare capacity in order to accommodate them.    III. Global Influences on the Stance of Monetary Policy    Just as global factors affect the relationship between domestic slack and inflation, they influence the   monetary policy setting needed to achieve the inflation target. In particular, global integration affects the   transmission mechanism of domestic monetary policy, the degree of spillovers from foreign monetary   policies, and the equilibrium rate of interest itself.     25        If and when global integration stops progressing, this shift down in the Phillips curve would reverse.                                                                                                                              10     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                             10   For the past thirty years, a number of profound forces in the world economy has pushed down on the level of                                                                                                 26   world real interest rates by as much as 450 basis points (Charts 7 and 8).                         These forces include the lower   relative price of capital (in part as a consequence of the de-materialising of investment), higher costs of                                                                                                                                                27   financial intermediation (due to financial reforms), lower public investment and greater private deleveraging.                                                                                                                         28   Two other factors � demographics and the distribution of income � merit particular attention.

The   entire distribution of growth rates matters: not only the mean, but also the volatility, asymmetry and fatness of the tails.

The crucial point is that these effects should persist                                                                                                                                         30   after the demographic trends have stabilised because the stock, not the flow, of savings is what matters.    By changing the distribution of income, the global integration of labour markets may also lower global R*.   The changes in relative wages in advanced economies have shifted income towards skilled workers, who   have a relatively higher propensity to save. Rising incomes in emerging market economies may be   reinforcing that effect as saving rates are structurally higher in emerging market economies, reflecting a                                                                               31   variety of factors including different social safety regimes.    The high mobility of capital across borders means that returns to capital will move closely together across                                                                     32   countries, with any marked divergences arbitraged.    As a consequence, global factors are the main drivers of domestic long-run real rates at both high and low   frequencies (Charts 9 and 10). For example, Bank of England analysis suggests that about 75% of the      29      Lisack, N, Sajedi, R and Thwaites, G, �Demographics and the real interest rate�, forthcoming.   30      Although retirees dis-save, they also tend to retain relatively high wealth during their retirement, so as the share of the population in   retirement increases the stock of savings will remain elevated even as the flow of savings falls.   31      As Ben Bernanke noted, a �savings glut� from emerging economies developed in the run-up to the crisis (see remarks on �The Global   saving glut and the US current account deficit�, 10 March 2005). Global labour market integration could also have lowered the   equilibrium real interest rate because households in EMEs are relatively risk averse, and this has increased global risk aversion as   wealth has shifted from AEs to EMEs; see Hall, R.E. (2016), �The role of the growth of risk-averse wealth in the decline of the safe real   interest rate, NBER Working Paper No.22196.   32      Of course, various frictions to complete capital mobility � including home bias, borrowing constraints because securities are imperfect   substitutes and incomplete risk sharing across countries � will yield some divergence.                                                                                                                                              12     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                             12                                                                                                        33   movement in UK long-run equilibrium rates is driven by global factors (Chart 10).

We are here because long and varied experience has shown that price stability is the best contribution   monetary policy can make to the public good.    High inflation hurts the least well off in society the most. It distorts price signals, inhibits investment, and   ultimately damages the economy�s productive capacity. Equally, deflation imperils growth and employment,   and, in the extreme, leads to financial ruin and economic collapse.    The happy medium is low, stable and predictable inflation. A little inflation greases the wheels of the   economy, and it gives monetary policy space to deliver better outcomes for jobs and growth when shocks hit.    Recognising the value to society of price stability is one thing, delivering it is quite another.    The Bad Old Days    Prices were anything but stable during the 1970s and 80s. With the collapse of Bretton Woods in 1971, UK   monetary policy lost its nominal anchor. There followed a series of botched experiments, with targets for   incomes, monetary aggregates and the exchange rate. The costs of such failures were enormous, with   prices rising by 750% in the twenty-five years to 1992, more than over the previous two hundred and fifty   years. Unemployment was high and growth volatile.    The inflation target rose from the ashes of the ERM debacle twenty five years ago this month, marking the   point when price stability became the unambiguous objective of UK monetary policy.    The new framework was a success, though only a partial one. That�s because, with interest rate decisions   still made by the Chancellor, it wasn�t fully credible. Experience teaches that political control of monetary   policy decisions suffers from time inconsistency, in which policymakers promise low inflation, then go for   faster growth and ultimately achieve neither.    Conversely, welfare can be improved if governments first choose the preferred rate of inflation and then   delegate operational responsibility to the central bank to achieve it.                                                                                                                          2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                    2   The UK Framework for Monetary Independence    So it was in 1997 when Gordon Brown boldly gave the Bank of England operational control for setting   monetary policy.                                                                                                                                             1   The Bank of England Act of 1998 clarified � for the first time in three centuries � the Bank�s responsibilities.   It gave a new independent body of the Bank, the MPC, a clear remit to achieve the inflation target over the   medium term. The inflation target is symmetric (meaning we care as much about returning inflation to target   from below as from above), and it applies at all times. Subject to achieving the target, the MPC is also   required to support the Government�s economic policy objective, currently strong, sustainable and balanced   growth.    Accountability    Under what Mervyn King termed constrained discretion, the Bank takes its orders from the remit and is   accountable to Parliament and the people for its performance.    Their expectations certainly have changed since Montagu Norman justified his decisions to a compliant   predecessor of the TSC by appealing opaquely to his �instincts.� Not a response I�ve dared to venture during   my thirty odd parliamentary testimonies. More seriously, the need for the Bank to be open and accountable   is greater than ever, not only because of the growing distrust of institutions and the �experts� who reside   within them, but also because better public understanding makes our policies more effective.    That�s why the Bank has increased dramatically the scale and quality of its outreach. We now publish all   relevant information for each policy decision on the day it is released. We disclose the key judgments   underlying our forecasts and account for differences when they occur. Leveraging our network of 12 regional   agencies, we meet with thousands of businesses every year, discuss with the tens of thousands of people   who attend our town halls and Public Forums, and engage with the hundreds of thousands more through   social media.    Performance and Lessons Learned    The gains from independence have been enormous. In the two decades that followed independence,   inflation averaged just under 2% compared with over 6% in the preceding two. It�s been one-fifth as volatile.   Crucially, independence allowed monetary policy to respond boldly and effectively to the biggest financial   crisis in a century. And it leaves the Bank well placed to address a range of possible developments around   Brexit.      1     As former Governor Eddie George once remarked, in the half century that followed its nationalisation in 1946 �the Bank operated   under legislation which, remarkably, did not attempt to define our objectives or functions.� They were, instead, �assumed to carry over   from [the Bank�s] earlier long history.� George, E (2000), �Central bank independence�, speech at the SEANZA Governors� Symposium,   26 August 2000.                                                                                                                                        3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                          3   Over the past twenty years, we have also learned a few important lessons. Allow me to highlight three.    First, the financial crisis exposed how a healthy focus on price stability became a dangerous distraction.   Central banks had won the war against inflation during the Great Moderation only to lose the peace as   vulnerabilities built inexorably.    Now monetary policy isn�t best placed to address risks to financial stability but the challenge is that the   necessary financial policy decisions are also subject to time inconsistency problems. Financial lobbies are   strong, and the temptations of a dash for growth are powerful. Conversely, there are no obvious or   immediate rewards to the tough decisions necessary to avoid future crises. In the world of financial stability,   success is an orphan.    That is why when the Bank was fundamentally reformed after the crisis, the procedures and structures of the   MPC were largely replicated in the Bank�s two new policy committees, the FPC and the PRC. Crucially, all   the Bank�s committees have access to the Bank�s information and analysis, all are well-informed about each   other�s reaction functions and all can coordinate their policies when appropriate. The Bank�s Committees are   independent but not isolated.    The second lesson of the past two decades has been the importance of the flexibility in flexible inflation   targeting.    While the inflation target applies at all times, the remit has always acknowledged that inflation may deviate   temporarily from the target on account of shocks. Since 2013, it has explicitly recognised that in exceptional   circumstances, bringing inflation back to target too rapidly could cause undesirable volatility in output and   employment.    In exceptional circumstances like today when the economy is facing profound structural change, the MPC   can extend the horizon over which it returns inflation to target from above in order to balance the effects on   jobs and activity. After all, even though monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely   to accompany the transition to new trading arrangements with the EU, it can influence how this hit to   incomes is distributed between job losses and price rises.    This brings me to my final point: while carefully circumscribed independence is highly effective in delivering   price and financial stability, it cannot deliver lasting prosperity and it cannot solve broader societal   challenges. This bears emphasising because in recent years a host of issues have been laid at the door of   the Bank of England from housing affordability to poor productivity.    Calls for the Bank to solve these challenges ignore the Bank�s carefully defined objectives. And they   confuse independence with omnipotence.                                                                                                                       4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                 4   Monetary and financial stability are foundational. They are necessary for prosperity but they aren�t sufficient   to deliver it.    The biggest determinants of the UK�s medium-term prosperity will be the country�s new relationship with the   EU and the reforms it catalyses. Most of the necessary adjustments are real in nature and therefore not in   the gift of central bankers.    The Bank will do everything it can to support adjustment consistent with its statutory obligations. We will   continue to assess and express our independent assessment of the risks associated with Brexit. We will   also use all our powers, consistent with our remits, to mitigate those risks and to smooth the adjustment to   new opportunities.    Monetary policy will be set to achieve the inflation target in a way that helps smooth real adjustment in the   economy and supports jobs in the wake of very large external forces.    Banks will be capitalised so that they can withstand any severe shock that could be associated with Brexit �   however unlikely � and still meet demand for credit.    The financial system as a whole will have the capacity to finance the transition and the opportunities beyond.    These are the best contributions the Bank of England can make to the good of the people of the United   Kingdom.                                                ****************************    Ultimately, the prosperity of the UK will reflect not just the final Brexit arrangements but also the   government�s fiscal and structural policies. The first speaker at this conference is the best placed to address   these topics.    It could, however, have been very different. As some of you may know, the Prime Minister began her career   as a new graduate at the Bank before leaving after six years to pursue other interests � ultimately politics.   Whilst at the Bank, the Prime Minister worked in the Economic Intelligence Department � then the cutting   edge of our activities. During her time she accomplished great things and was destined for much more. Just   imagine what could have become of your career, Prime Minister, if you had stayed at the Bank: you could   have been in Fishmongers Hall�                                                                                                                       5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                 5   Instead you came here by a road less travelled. Theresa May was elected as MP for Maidenhead in 1997,   just as the Bank was getting to grips with its newfound monetary policy independence. She held a number   of positions in the shadow cabinets of a string of opposition leaders and served as the Chair of the   Conservative Party. After the formation of the coalition government in 2010, she would become the longest-   serving Home Secretary in over 60 years. During that period, she confronted many of society�s biggest   challenges � for example introducing legislation to tackle domestic violence, to eradicate modern slavery and   to counter terrorism.    Never afraid of a challenge, she stepped into the breach to become Prime Minister following the referendum.    The Prime Minister and her Government are committed to making the most of the opportunities that Brexit   brings, and more fundamentally to working to build a stronger, fairer and more prosperous country for all.    Please join me in welcoming the Prime Minister, Theresa May.                                                                                                                    6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                              6
2017-12-05	"Turning back the Tide   Speech given by   Mark Carney,   Governor of the Bank of England       FICC Market Standard Board �Two years on from the Fair and Effective Markets Review�   Bloomberg, London   29 November 2017       I am grateful to Terry Allen, Alice Carr, Orlando Fernandez Ruiz, Edward Ocampo, Analise Mercieca,   Sasha Mills, Louse Oscarius, Chris Salmon and Tim Taylor for their assistance in preparing these   remarks.                                                                                                        1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches   It is a pleasure to join the FICC Market Standards Board (FMSB) in reflecting on what�s happened in the two   years since the Fair and Effective Markets Review (FEMR). This afternoon I would like to assess recent   progress in building real markets for the good of the people and discuss the forward agenda for your   important work.     Two and a half years ago, FEMR set out a series of ambitious recommendations to restore confidence in                                                                             1   Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) markets.     The FMSB�s work is an integral part of the FEMR solution.     Your work matters because UK markets are essential for global commerce.     The City has a special responsibility to address the root causes of misconduct given its pre-eminent position   in global markets. The UK accounts for 40% of both global FX volumes and trades in OTC interest rate   derivatives, and two-thirds of trading in international bonds. More international banking activity is booked in                                      2   London than anywhere else.     Your work matters because the financial sector is an important contributor to UK prosperity.     Finance is one of the largest sectors of the UK economy. Around 400,000 people are employed in financial                                                                                     3   services in London alone, 1.1 million across the country as whole. Their enterprise contributes �115 billion   to our national income, �80 billion to our exports and �70 billion to the Exchequer, equivalent to two-thirds of                       4   the NHS budget.     Your work matters because finance is not an end in itself; financial markets serve the real economy.     By financing firms that hire, invest and expand, markets drive growth.     By opening up cross border trade and investment, they create new opportunities for businesses and savers.     By transferring risks to those most willing and able to bear them, markets help households and businesses   insure against the unexpected.       1     See Fair and Effective Markets Review Final Report, HM Treasury, Bank of England and FCA (June 2015).

The Problem     Though markets are generally a force for good, markets can go wrong.     Left unattended, they are prone to instability, excess and abuse.     Following the global financial crisis, a series of scandals ranging from mis-selling to manipulation   undermined trust in banking, in the financial system, and to some degree, in markets themselves.     In FICC markets, misconduct was revealed on a scale that impaired their ability to function fairly and   effectively.     The economic consequences have been enormous. Global banks� misconduct costs have exceeded $320   billion, capital that could otherwise have supported around $5 trillion of lending to households and                  5   businesses.     More worrying still, an industry of the scale, importance and complexity of finance needs social capital as   well as economic capital in order to operate, innovate and grow.     Repeated episodes of misconduct have called the social licence of finance into question.     In a system where trust is fundamental, it ought to be of grave concern that only 20% of UK citizens now                                                                              6   think that banks are well run, compared to 90% in the 1980s.     The scale of the challenge of restoring trust is thrown into sharp relief by the FMSB�s comprehensive review   of misconduct over the past two centuries. The history of financial fraud has rhymed all too frequently.     Potential Solutions     In the cycle of scandal, response, integrity, drift, and renewed scandal; potential solutions have oscillated   between the extremes of Self Regulation and Total Regulation.     Recent difficulties illustrate the problems with each of these approaches.     5     See FSB Chair�s letter to G20 Leaders �Building a safer, simpler and fairer financial system� ahead of the Hamburg Summit, (July   2017). Estimates of the impact on lending capacity are Bank of England calculations.   6     British Social Attitudes Survey (2013).                                                                                                                                        3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                      3   By undervaluing the importance of hard and soft infrastructure to the functioning of real markets, light touch                                                          7   regulation led directly to the financial crisis.     Multiple factors contributed to a tide of ethical drift in FICC markets. Market standards were poorly   understood, often ignored and always lacked teeth. Too many participants neither felt responsible for the   system nor recognised the full impact of their actions. Bad behaviour went unchecked, proliferated and   eventually became the norm.     Given the economic and social consequences of the ensuing disaster, it is right that regulators proscribe   certain behaviours and set out their high level expectations. Yet, authorities cannot regulate for every   circumstance, watch every transaction, or anticipate every market innovation. Total regulation is bound to fail   because it promotes a culture of complying with the letter of the law, not its spirit, and because authorities   inevitably lag developments in fast-changing markets.     But it doesn�t have to be this way.     A more comprehensive and dynamic solution combines public regulation with private standards and then   buttresses them with a series of hard incentives which materially increase individual understanding and   accountability.     Market standards can be effective if they:          -    Articulate clearly the market�s collective view of best practice, with worked practical examples to             clarify grey areas;          -    Are grounded in, and are reinforced by, relevant regulatory frameworks and requirements;          -    Are kept current; and          -    Are given teeth by incentives that foster adoption and adherence.     An Early Assessment of the FMSB�s work     So how is the FMSB doing in establishing common standards of market practice that are well understood,   widely followed dynamically relevant?     The FMSB is already making an important contribution.    7     �Hard infrastructure� refers to the way in which markets are organised. �Soft infrastructure� refers to the standards and norms,   including regulation, market standards and codes, by which markets operate.                                                                                                                                        4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                      4   Drawing on the expertise of its members, the FMSB has finalised standards that codify best practice with   respect to: reference price transactions, commodity binary options, and new bond issues. A standard on risk   management transactions for new bond issues is nearly final, and an earlier draft standard on FX stop-loss   orders has been absorbed into the FX Global Code.     In each case, potential conflicts of interest are mapped to high-level principles designed to mitigate them.   For reference price transactions, emphasis is placed on transparency with clients on mechanics and   potential conflicts, and on mitigating the risk that the wider transactions of dealers could be market moving.   The draft standard on risk management for new bond issuances sets out principles to mitigate risks around   selection and formation of reference rates.     The FMSB�s Statements of Good Practice, such as for surveillance of FX markets, provide more detailed   guidance and worked examples to help set expectations.     The FMSB is also scanning the horizon for future misconduct risks, including through its innovative   behavioural cluster analysis. Rightly, given rapid changes in underlying market structure, this process has   prioritised work on vulnerabilities arising from fast automated markets.     Will These Standards and Codes Make a Difference?     We know from history that codes are of little use if nobody reads, follows or enforces them.     Why should the FMSB�s efforts be expected to help reverse the tide of ethical drift? Indeed, given the long                                                                                                             8   history of misconduct, aren�t such efforts akin to King Canute rebuking the waves?     I�m more optimistic that the tide will turn because the FMSB is part of a much broader effort by UK authorities   and market participants. Together, we have created a comprehensive and mutually reinforcing set of   measures that strengthen the hard and soft market infrastructure.     The resulting incentives give FMSB standards moral force and practical consequence.     First, in the FMSB�s core work, the best in the market are taking responsibility for identifying and codifying   best practice, in a way that complements and reinforces existing regulation. The FMSB now convenes senior   participants from fifty global issuers, underwriters, asset managers, exchanges, custodians and investment   banks. The breadth and engagement of the membership gives its standards credibility and creates peer   pressure within the industry to promote adherence.    8     Canute, King of Denmark, England and Norway, 995-1035, reputedly set his throne by the sea shore and commanded the incoming   tide to halt and not wet his feet and robes. Yet ""continuing to rise as usual [the tide] dashed over his feet and legs without respect to his   royal person. Then the king leapt backwards, saying: 'Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings, for there is none   worthy of the name, but He whom heaven, earth, and sea obey by eternal laws.'                                                                                                                                            5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                             5   Second, peer pressure within firms should reinforce standards and, more generally, the commitment to real   markets.     Most banks have codes of ethics or business principles. These are necessary but not sufficient not least   because it isn�t reasonable to expect every trader to absorb their meaning or to translate them readily into   live situations. But it is reasonable to expect them to use FMSB guidance to help recognise the differences   between a real market and a rigged one. And it is essential that business cultures encourage everyone to   call out market abuse when it occurs.     Third, buyside pressure for proper behaviour is made easier by clear, practical standards. This is formalised   in the example of the FX Global Code, where major central banks including the Bank of England, have   confirmed that they intend to adhere to the principles of the Code, and that they also expect the same of their                                     9   regular FX counterparties. Similarly, the Bank of England will adhere to the UK Money Markets Code and   Precious Metals Code and will expect the same of its market counterparties.     Fourth, the combination of new arrangements for compensation, the expectations of the Senior Managers   Regime (SMR), regulation and market standards are mutually reinforcing. In the UK, a significant proportion   of the variable compensation of key decision-makers must now be deferred for a period of seven years to   ensure it can be clawed back over the time scales it generally takes for conduct issues to come to light.     The SMR gives teeth to voluntary codes by incentivising firms to develop, adopt and embed them.     By requiring identification of the most senior decision-makers of banks, insurers and major investment firms,   and setting requirements on them, the SMR re-establishes the link between seniority and accountability,   strengthens individual accountability, and reinforces collective responsibility.     Senior Managers can now be held individually accountable if they fail to take reasonable steps (including   training or proper oversight) to prevent or stop regulatory breaches in their areas of responsibility.     The SMR prescribes individual responsibilities � typically to the Chair and CEO respectively � for developing   and embedding a firm�s culture, alongside a collective responsibility for the Board.     And under the related Certification Regime, firms must also annually assess and certify the fitness and   propriety of a wide range of risk-taking employees.     To help meet all of these expectations, Senior Managers can draw on market standards in order to explain   and promote good practice, assess their risk-takers, and build a strong culture.     9       See the BIS Press Release on the FX Global Code , available at: https://www.bis.org/press/p170525.htm.                                                                                                                  6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                6   There are encouraging signs that the SMR is already beginning to make a difference.     For firms, it is clarifying and improving governance, accountability and decision-making processes. Senior   Managers are increasingly focusing on building cultures of risk awareness, openness and ethical behaviour.                                                                                                                  10   In the words of one chair �responsibility for culture has moved to the top of my agenda.�     For supervisors, the regime is helping identify weaknesses in governance and accountability, and to assess   the fitness and propriety of senior managers and others in positions of responsibility, and whether the firm   has an appropriate culture, and is encouraging the necessary changes.     In the first instance, consistent or widespread shortcomings would have consequences for compensation.   More persistent failings could increase the capital that must be set aside for operational risks, and in the   extreme, could influence our judgements regarding the fitness and propriety of senior managers.     Over time, market codes may become more firmly embedded still, something on which the FCA is currently                 11   consulting.     The Way Forward     The mutually reinforcing relationship between the regulatory framework and market good practice should   help the FMSB, and other market standard-setters, maintain their ambition and momentum even once   memories of post-crisis misconduct fade.     It could sharpen collective incentives to address, more conclusively, outstanding ambiguities that act as   obstacles to real markets. And it should help mitigate emerging vulnerabilities.     The Bank of England encourages the FMSB to consider where additional guidance and worked examples   could buttress its existing standards, to guard against the risk that certain principles mean different things to   different parties.     The City�s special responsibility, given its pre-eminent position in global markets, is why it has brought so   many ideas and such energy to advance reforms to address the misconduct risk that has plagued global   markets.       10     See page 16, Financial Reporting Council (FRC), �Corporate Culture and the Role of Boards: Report of observations�, July 2016.   11     In light of its responsibilities for conduct and market integrity, the FCA is consulting on an approach under which it would formalise   that in supervising to, and enforcing, SMR rules for unregulated markets and activities, it would consider whether firms and individuals   are meeting �proper standards of market conduct� with reference to �recognised� industry codes. See FCA CP17/37 available at:   https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp17-37-consultation-paper-industry-codes-conduct-and-discussion-paper                                                                                                                                          7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                        7   These efforts have helped set the international agenda, with many of the themes identified in FEMR are   finding support more broadly, particularly in the work of the Financial Stability Board (FSB).     The FSB�s misconduct action plan, presented to the G20 Leaders� Summit in July 2017, includes:         (i)     Developing new global standards of conduct in fixed income, commodities and currency               markets, of the sort that the FMSB has championed, as well the FX global code, in which UK-               based authorities and market participants played an important role;         (ii)    Direct measures to strengthen financial institution governance and compensation structures to               align better risk and reward, including developing governance toolkits, which will address               individual accountability, firms� risk culture, and the risk of �rolling bad apples�, (all of which are in               place in the UK); and         (iii)   Reform of major financial benchmarks arrangements to reduce the risks of their manipulation.     I would like to say a few words about this final strand before concluding.     The goal of this work is to restore confidence in the integrity of key interest rate benchmarks globally.   Reforms to the governance of Libor � which is vital hard infrastructure in UK markets and for many borrowers   in the real economy � have gone a long way to meeting this objective. That is the good news. The bad   news is that it has become increasingly clear that we cannot rely on Libor in the long term.     Libor is meant to measure banks� short-term unsecured funding costs. But the reality is that bank funding   markets have changed, and banks no longer take enough wholesale term deposits to form the basis for a   robust transaction-based benchmark.     As we have pointed out in the past, the result is that Libor is overly reliant on expert judgement rather than   actual transactions. That situation is neither desirable nor sustainable.     There is also a risk that panel banks might withdraw from Libor and precipitate its collapse, which raises   obvious financial stability concerns.     So there is a clear need for the authorities and market participants, across every sector, to come together,   and transition to alternative benchmarks.                                                                                                                          8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                      8   Under the auspices of the FSB, authorities in the UK, US, Japan and Switzerland have worked with market   participants to identify alternative benchmarks. In the UK, the market-led Working Group on Sterling Risk                                                                                                          12   Free Rates recently confirmed SONIA as its preferred alternative to Sterling Libor.     Market participants in every sector and market that uses Libor now need to come together to identify and   resolve issues, change business practices, and adopt alternative benchmarks.     To support the next phase of this work, the Bank and FCA are today announcing that from January, the   Sterling Risk Free Rate Working Group will have a new mandate and wider representation from across the   market. Its key objective will be to pursue a broad-based transition from Libor to SONIA by 2021. Buy side   firms, issuers, infrastructure firms and trade associations will be brought into the Group alongside banks and   broker-dealers.     We are under no illusions about the complexity of the task. Libor is embedded throughout the financial                                                                                 13   system in derivatives, loans, bonds and commercial contracts.     The Bank and FCA are committed to supporting UK market participants as they prepare for the transition.     Reasserting London�s Leadership of Real Markets     To conclude, two years on from FEMR, by working together, we are making enormous progress.     We are moving from markets that collapse when there is a shock from abroad to markets that are resilient.     From markets where transactions occur in chat rooms to markets that are professional and open.     From markets where few were accountable for anything to markets where everyone is responsible for their   actions.     The FMSB is playing an essential role in this transformation.     When your standards are combined with more robust regulatory requirements, new compensation   arrangements and the Senior Managers Regime, we are achieving what Canute could not.     The tide of misconduct is going out, revealing the real markets working for the good of the people of the   United Kingdom and the world.     12     To facilitate a smooth transition, the FCA has coordinated panel banks to support Libor until the end of 2021.   13     See the Record of the September FPC meeting at   http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/Records/fpc/2017/record1710.aspx                                                                                                                      9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                    9"
2017-12-19	"Bank of England Future Forum 2017   Opening remarks given by   Mark Carney   Governor, Bank of England       St. George�s Hall, Liverpool   16 November 2017                                                                             1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches   Good afternoon. Welcome to the Bank of England�s Future Forum to everyone here in beautiful St George�s   Hall, and to those viewing on our webcast.    My colleagues and I are delighted to be here in Merseyside. It�s been three decades since I first visited.   Back then, I discovered my favourite band the Lightning Seeds, who would later pen England�s football   anthem.    We�ll learn next year whether the Three Lions can end what�s become fifty years of hurt.    1987 was the Life of Riley for local football. Everton and Liverpool were top of the tables, with the Toffees   beating the Reds to win the Championship � sadly their most recent of their 9 titles.    How things change. It�s not pure and simple all the time.    Just like footballing fortunes, economic conditions in Liverpool have waxed and waned. The   de-industrialisation of the 1970s and 80s affected the region particularly badly, with unemployment ultimately   rising to above 20%. With the 1990s came revival and regeneration, with particular emphasis on the city�s   rich cultural and economic history � a heritage rightly celebrated when city centre riverfront was designated a   World Heritage Site in 2004 and when Liverpool became European Capital for Culture in 2008.    In the decade that followed that honour, the UK has been through a searing financial crisis and a recovery   that has been even slower than that following the Great Depression. Once the financial system was fixed,   however, the UK became, until recently, the fastest growing economy in the G7. Unemployment nationwide   has fallen from 8.5% to 4.3%, a 42-year low. In Liverpool, the unemployment rate has declined steadily to   4.7% today, around 2 percentage points below its pre-crisis rate.    The recovery here is being aided by further regeneration, both economic and physical � building the   infrastructure that will enable businesses and households to flourish. These efforts are building on past   successes, with Liverpool now home to many award-winning museums including the Museum of Liverpool,   the International Slavery Museum, and Tate Liverpool.    Liverpool Council is working in partnership with businesses and other organisations to exploit the best of   what each can bring. For example, Liverpool Council, Liverpool FC and Your Housing Group are working   together to bring new vibrancy to the Anfield area. I personally heard last night about some of the great work   that Everton in the Community are doing to tackle problems like homelessness and boost educational   attainment. And the club of course has ambitious plans for a new stadium at Bramley Moore dock.   Liverpool�s Science Park provides office space alongside commercial labs, right at the heart of the city�s   Knowledge Quarter.                                                                                                                       2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                 2   We�re here today to discuss with you what causes changes in the economy, how they affect people and   businesses in Merseyside and across the country and the Bank of England�s role in supporting jobs and   growth.    The economy matters for everyone and people want to understand it better. Three quarters think there   should be better education about the economy and half want a better understanding themselves but virtually   no-one � just 1 in 10 � think public figures talk about economics in an accessible way.    Today, we are trying to bridge that gap. We are helping to make discussions of the economy more   accessible and are launching practical tools that can be used to help educate students, and indeed   everyone, about the economy.    This is all part of a wider effort to improve our communications. We are doing this to make the Bank more   open and accountable. Quite simply, people need to understand our actions and their effects in order to hold   us to account. Doing so will also make our policies more effective.    Let me give you an example. Our mission was originally set out in 1694 in the Bank�s founding charter. That   was to �promote the publick Good� � although that sentiment was contained within a 700 word sentence,   hardly clear and transparent communication. And in practice at the time what it meant was raising money to   carry on a war against France.    Today, our mission is still to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom, but now we do that by   maintaining monetary and financial stability. Let me explain what that means.    Maintaining monetary stability means two things. First, providing banknotes that you can use and trust. We   have over 3 billion notes currently in use, and they are used in 44% of all transactions. Second, it means   maintaining low and stable inflation.    Maintaining financial stability means three things. First, making sure that when you put your money in a   bank it is safe. Second, it means that if a bank fails, the costs fall on the bank�s investors and senior   management, not ordinary people with deposits in banks. And finally it means making sure that if you take   out an insurance contract, it will pay out if whatever you are insuring against happens.    The work that the Bank does in all of these areas can ultimately be summed up very simply: we maintain   confidence in money. This confidence is not, though an end in itself; it is a means to an end. Confidence in   money provides the foundations for prosperity. Without it, companies would struggle to provide the goods   and services we all use every day; you would face difficulties in knowing how to invest for your futures, be it   financing studies or buying a house. Maintaining this confidence is the best contribution the Bank of England   can make to the good of the people of the United Kingdom.                                                                                                                    3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                               3   Building public understanding of what the Bank does � by engaging with people directly� is essential to our   work.    That�s because our policies work better if our objectives are clear and the British people have confidence that   we will do the right thing whatever happens.    Improving understanding of the Bank�s role is also part of being accountable to the people we serve. The   Bank is at the heart of the UK economy. The responsibilities Parliament has given us are wide-ranging and   the decisions we take affect everyone in the country. People deserve the information and tools to judge how   well we are doing our job and to know that we are listening to your views.    Today�s event is also part of a wider effort by the Bank to move beyond traditional modes of communication   to speak more directly to the people we serve. While three hundred thousand people read the Financial   Times, there are 30 million Facebook users in the UK. And while everyone knows it is good to talk, the Bank   is learning how it can also be good to Tweet � our Twitter account has 227,000 followers, though that still   leaves us a little behind Wayne Rooney�s 16.7 million.    We are revamping our publications to make them more accessible, using icons and graphics to convey our   messages on webpages designed for mobiles and tablets, rather than relying only on pages of words on   paper. You can take a look at our first example of this � the November Inflation Report �online, at   www.inflationreport.co.uk.    This afternoon�s event will showcase a selection of the materials we are planning to run alongside these   changes in our communications to help explain to people about the Bank�s work.    To bring that to life, the first session will kick off with three of my colleagues � Ben, Sam and Jon �explaining   to you what the Bank is doing on some topical issues, things that are influencing the Bank�s policies and the   role we play in the economy right now. The questions they will answer are:         ?       Why did the Bank change interest rates earlier this month?        ?       What we are doing to keep banks safe?; and         ?       What are we doing in response to the vote to leave the EU to ensure the Brexit process is as smooth               as possible?    Through our dialogue with you today, we will enrich our understanding of how we can meet our objective   more effectively, and we hope you will gain a better understanding of what the Bank does and how it is going   about it.                                                                                                                     4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                 4   Before handing back to Ranvir, I�d like to thank Speakers for Schools, We Are Futures, Economy.org and   Rethinking Economics � the key stakeholders that have helped us with this morning�s events and who have   been working with us to develop our educational resources.

2018-02-20	"Reflections on Leadership in a Disruptive Age   Speech given by   Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England     Regent�s University London   Monday 19 February 2018       I am grateful to Jennifer Nemeth for her assistance in preparing these remarks.                                                                                      1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches        I.    Introduction    I was asked to reflect tonight on leadership and values. This is somewhat dangerous territory, and certainly   one that creates a target-rich environment for critics who can spot gaps between preaching and practising.   Indeed, a review of a recent book on leadership and values suggested that it�s very publication signalled   overconfidence � the complacency before the storm � and cautioned that CEOs and investors ought to be   wary of the �curse of authorship�.    There are countless examples of pride coming before the fall in finance. Think of those who dubbed the   period before the Global Financial Crisis the �Great Moderation�. Or the four most expensive words in the                          1   English language.    But, because we can learn from experience, and because leadership lies at the heart of Regent�s   University�s mission- literally �Developing tomorrow�s global leaders� - I will forge ahead.    I will begin by reviewing the main activities of leaders and the core attributes of leadership. I will try to   address what leadership is and isn�t and whether it�s inherent or can be developed. I will conclude with some   perspectives on the challenges and opportunities you will face leading in our disruptive age.         II.   Leadership Activities    It�s important to distinguish between what leaders do and who they are.    Of the many things leaders must do, I would emphasise three:           1. Finding and developing the right people;           2. Setting priorities; and           3. Catalysing action.    Of these, arguably the most important is focusing on finding and developing the right people.    Developing the right people starts with recruiting widely.    The Bank of England has embraced the perspectives of those such as the leading venture capitalist, Sir Ken                                                                                                      2   Olisa, who stresses that: �Tackling [diversity] is a business imperative and not an HR policy.� Ten years ago   the Bank�s graduate intake was comprised largely of economists drawn from just 11 universities. Last year,   we hired from over 40 post-secondary institutions with half of the intake having studied sciences, business,   law and the humanities. Of the 700 experienced professionals we hired in 2017, almost half were women                                                          3   and a quarter came from BAME backgrounds.     1       �This time it�s different�   2       As quoted in HR magazine, September 2017.   3       In 2010, 30% of the Bank�s experienced hires were women and 10% were from a BAME background.                                                                                                                   2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                 2   Once the right people are through the door they need to be developed. That includes identifying a pipeline   of future leaders with a diverse and broad set of experiences and pushing them in order to prepare   themselves for bigger roles. At the Bank, we not only recruit widely but also encourage colleagues to   collaborate across the organisation and spend time in different areas to develop the varied skills required of                                  4   a modern central banker.    In large organisations, developing future leaders requires discipline. For example, Vittorio Colao, the CEO of   Vodafone, reviews the company�s top 200 executives annually to assess performance, set development   actions and manage those who are having difficulties. The Executive Committee at Vodafone then   discusses the progress of a different subset of their leaders at each Executive Meeting, making the process   transparent and rigorous. The Bank of England has adopted a similar approach.    Developing the right people also requires a culture of inclusion that values diverse ideas, encourages open   debate, and empowers people at all levels to take initiative. In a moment, I will come onto the steps the   Bank of England is taking in these regards.    Finally, for leaders, having the right people also means being able to draw on trusted outside perspectives   such as an external advisory board or informal contacts with other leaders. I�m fortunate that in my role I can   regularly share experiences with a wide range of leaders in diverse fields. Of these, the most important   sounding boards are my fellow central bankers. In this circle of trust, we can have regular, frank discussions   of issues we either don�t understand or that are particularly sensitive.    The second critical thing that leaders do is to set the priorities for their organisation. Before they do so, a   good leader assesses the context in which their organisation operates. That process starts with discussions   with all stakeholders, including clients, senior managers and, via roundtables and surveys, colleagues at all   levels.    Understanding context requires developing intuitions about global developments and shifting technologies.   This has always been second nature to central banking, but there are few organisations today that are not   affected by the mega trends of shifting demographics, the accelerating pace of technological disruption and   the search for a more inclusive capitalism.    When setting priorities, time is of the essence because of both the rapid pace of global change and the arc of   a leader�s personal capital within their organisation. As the global head of McKinsey Dominic Barton   observes, �Great leaders set a clear agenda early on and then act on it fast. They never have as much                                                                   5   power or impact as when they first take on the role.�       4     This is part of the Bank�s Vision 2020 Strategic Plan launched in 2017, which aims to overhaul �how we work� and �how we   communicate�. See: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/governance-and-funding   5     Barton, D (2017) p. 3                                                                                                                                3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                              3   The third thing leaders do is to catalyse action. Specific catalysts vary with an organisation�s structure and   culture, but in all cases they require the full and visible commitment of the leader before devolving power to   colleagues. This means practicing what you preach, as General Colin Powell advised: �You can issue all the   memos you want and give all the motivational speeches�but if the rest of the people in your organisation                                                                                        6   don�t see you putting forth your best effort every single day, they won�t either.�    Catalysing action means listening to and empowering colleagues, who are more likely to follow a new   direction if they have been consulted during its development.    And it then means getting out of the way. As Teddy Roosevelt said, �The best executive is the one who has   sense enough to pick good people to do what [the leader] wants done, and self-restraint enough to keep                                                7   from meddling with them while they do it.�    Such delegation has traditionally been an anathema for central banks. But when following the crisis the   Bank of England doubled in size and tripled in responsibilities, we knew our rigid hierarchy had to change.    To start that process, we surveyed widely and met with colleagues across the Bank in order to develop our   new strategy. We then slashed the number of internal committees by two thirds and instituted a policy that   the author of every analysis had to be in the room whenever it was discussed. We�re now devolving   decisions to the right level, changing the way we meet and making the Bank more permeable to the outside   world by multiplying our channels of communications and the number of our spokespeople.    Finding and developing the right people, setting priorities and catalysing action are things that all leaders   must do, but what ultimately most determines a leader�s effectiveness is who they are.    III. Leadership Attributes    In my view, there are four essential and universal attributes of leadership:           1. Ambition           2. Purpose           3. Clarity, and           4. Humility.    1. Ambition    The first essential leadership trait is ambition. Not personal ambition but ambition for your organisation.       6       As quoted in Maxwell, J (2007) p.141   7       As quoted in Maxwell, J (2007) p. 230                                                                                                                   4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                 4   When she was Vice Chancellor of Cambridge University, Alison Richard, would ask �Who will be ambitious   on our behalf if we are not ambitious for ourselves? We cannot take Cambridge�s greatness for granted                                                                                                           8   even after 800 years. We must tend it with care and energy, and ambition must translate into tasks.�    If this message applies to Cambridge, an institution that is 800 years old, it certainly applies to the Bank of   England at a little more than three centuries, to Regent�s University at a little more than three decades, and   the latest start-up in Silicon Roundabout at a little more than three months.    2. Purpose    Ambition must be grounded in the purpose of the organisation. Purpose is what an organisation stands for;                                                                      9   why it does what it does; and what it should be trusted to deliver. Purpose is always broader than a simple   bottom line.    An organisation�s purpose can be for the client; such as Amazon�s goal �To be earth�s most customer-centric   company�; or the greater good, such as the World Bank�s mission to �End extreme poverty�, and the Bank of   England�s to �Promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial   stability�.    The leader�s job is to ensure that the purpose of their organisation is always present and anchors its goals,   values, and strategy.    Like diversity, purpose is not a �nice to have�. Evidence shows that purposeful companies have higher   employee engagement, greater customer satisfaction, tighter supplier linkages and better environmental   stewardship. The pay-offs to purposeful business are superior share price performance, better operational                                                                                                                 10   performance, lower costs of capital, smaller regulatory fines and greater resilience in the face of shocks.    Always remember that, as leaders, you will be stewards of the purpose of your organisations. In this sense,   leadership is the acceptance of responsibility rather than the assumption of power. True leadership is not an   end in itself but rather as a means to accomplishing a worthwhile goal.    These are lessons that some in financial services have had to re-learn in recent years.    An industry of the scale and importance of finance needs social capital as well as economic capital in order   to operate, innovate and grow.    To maintain social capital, finance ultimately needs to be seen as a vocation, an activity with high ethical   standards, which in turn conveys certain responsibilities. Those responsibilities recognise that finance is not   an end in itself but a means to promote investment, innovation, growth and prosperity.       8       As quoted in Barton, D (2017) p.11   9       Big Innovation Centre (2016) p.19   10        Big Innovation Centre (2016) figure1.2 (p. 23-33)                                                                                                                      5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                    5   Reforms of the financial system, particularly the Senior Managers Regime and industry-led Codes of   Conduct, are helping to embed purpose in financial services including by making culture the responsibility of   the CEO and the Chair and tasking industry with devising standards that take into consideration the needs of                            11   the system as whole.    3. Clarity    The third essential quality of leadership is clarity.    Clarity starts with the clarity of mind and sound judgment that arise from emotional awareness and control. A                                                                                                                                            12   good leader is contemplative, meaning they can be present in the moment and find meaning in experience.    Leaders will always find themselves facing multiple problems at the same time, but they have to be careful   not to bring all those problems with them during every interaction. Part of a leader�s job is to absorb the   stress so the rest of the organisation can focus. And they need to remember that each of their (many)   meetings each day is probably the most important for the others involved.    Clarity also means clarity of thought and communication: the ability to reduce complex problems to their                                                            13   essentials and then communicate them clearly.                 Say it straight. Say it simply. Say it over.    Leaders often use narratives to inspire people to act. Consider the difference between an exhortation �to   implement Cop21�s Nationally Determined Contributions in a determined fashion� with President Macron�s   simple statement, �Make no mistake on climate: there is no Plan B because there is no Planet B.�    When leaders speak, they get the balance right between realism and optimism, by acknowledging   uncertainty, mistakes and difficulties, but then by giving hope that these can be overcome. The engineer of   America�s Great Society, John Gardner, struck this delicate balance when he said: �What we have before us                                                                                         14   are some breath-taking opportunities disguised as insoluble problems.�    The Bank has sought to do the same on a number of issues ranging from:         ?   Climate change, where transition to a low carbon economy is a multi-trillion pound annual                                           15            opportunity for investors;         ?   To Brexit, where a financial services agreement between the UK and EU could serve as a template                                                                                  16            for liberalisation of free trade in services across the G20.       11      Carney, M (2017)   12      See Ng Kok Song, P (2014)   13      Organisations with effective communication are over four times more likely to report high levels of employee engagement and 20%   more likely to report low turnover according to a study by British Consultancy, CHA (as quoted in Kouzes, J and Posner, B (2010))   14      As quoted in Kouzes, J and Posner B (2010)   15      Carney, M (2015)   16      Carney, M (2017a)                                                                                                                                        6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                           6   When leaders get this balance right, the combination of purpose, hope and clarity inspires, unleashing the   talent and energy of the organisation. Inspiration is essential because it is impossible for leaders to meet   every challenge, see every opportunity, or manage every situation by themselves. The highest-performing   organisations are those with the highest number of people who are empowered to think as leaders                  17   themselves.    During the financial crisis the need for clarity of mind, thought and communication was paramount.    In its depth, panic took hold as, �Firmly held truths [were] no longer relied upon. Articles of faith [were]                                                                                                                          18   upended. And the very foundations of economies and markets [were] called into question.�                                                   19   The only goal in a panic is to stop it.             Leaders do this by, as Napoleon would command to his generals �[to]   march toward the sound of gunfire�. This requires mobilising quickly.    In this spirit, Tim Geithner�s refrain was �Plan beats no plan�. A plan provides the necessary clarity of mind   by focusing efforts and uniting people around a common goal. Even a strategy that is half-baked but gets   you out of immediate danger is better than waiting for the perfect answer and being annihilated.    Part of the plan to end the financial panic had to include reducing uncertainty over objectives. Some fretted   that actions to save a crumbling system would encourage reckless behaviour in the future. Ben Bernanke   was clear that invoking moral hazard in the middle of the U.S. financial crisis was misguided and                 20   dangerous.          Using the power of narrative, he challenged the arguments of the �moral hazard   fundamentalists� in his oft cited and simple hypothetical example: do you let the man who smoked in bed die   in the burning house to teach him a lesson? Or do you save him, stop the risk of surrounding houses                                                                                  21   catching fire and then reprimand him for reckless behaviour?    4. Humility    The final essential leadership quality is humility.    Recall what I said about this speech being a target-rich environment?    Good leaders combine personal humility, self-knowledge and the ability to learn. That means admitting   mistakes, seeking and accepting feedback and sharing the lessons you have learned. When leaders   become over confident (or turn to writing books), they stop learning.       17      Barton, D (2017) p.10   18      Warsh, K (2009)   19      As Tim Geithner, NY Fed Chair and later Secretary of the Treasury said �In an emergency you [the leader] need to lean against the   forces of panic, restore confidence and reduce uncertainty.� Geithner, T (2014)   20      Alternatively, Tim Geithner summarised the issue as follows: �Herein lies the paradox. In a brutal financial crisis like ours, actions that   seem reasonable � letting banks fail, forcing their creditors to absorb losses, balancing government budgets, avoiding moral hazard �   only make the crisis worse. And the actions necessary to ease the crisis seem inexplicable and unfair�. Geithner, T (2014)   21      Bernanke, B (2015) p.261 - 262                                                                                                                                              7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                              7   As a leader you also need to be humble about success and honest about failure. Humility and honesty are   essential to authenticity, which to paraphrase Groucho Marx, is very hard to fake. Being authentic means   doing what you say, and people knowing who you are � including what you believe in, what drives you, as   well as your strengths and, importantly, your weaknesses. Authenticity is intimately connected with trust.   People may not agree with all of your decisions, but they deserve to know why you made them. And your                                                                           22   decisions will be easier to follow if people know what you stand for.    When a leader admits their weaknesses, they recognise that they are on a path of continuous learning and   self-improvement. Becoming a leader does not mean you have made it and have nothing left to learn.                                                                                                  23   Rather leadership is a discipline that involves deliberate practice and continuous learning.    In this spirit, policymakers must remain humble as they work to build a more resilient financial system.    We must remember that, although we can make financial crises less likely to happen and less severe when   they do occur, we cannot abolish them. Something will go wrong again even if we do not know exactly what   or precisely when. Accepting this means our best strategy is to create an anti-fragile system that can   withstand potential shocks when they happen.    To accomplish that we are bridging, buttressing and burying.    Bridging by overhauling the way we provide liquidity. The Bank of England is now open for business with a   wider range of collateral, to a wider range of counterparties, for longer terms, at lower fees than ever before.    Whereas before the crisis, the combination of banks own liquidity resources and their access to central bank   facilities covered a mere 10% of short term liabilities of banks prone to run risk, today the figure is more than   100%.    The benefits of this new approach were clear around the Brexit referendum. In the run-up to the vote, the   Bank undertook extensive contingency planning which included encouraging banks to pre-position enough   collateral in our facilities to enable them to draw up to �250 billion in liquidity on demand. The combination of   this war chest and coordinated G7 central bank action helped ensure markets functioned normally as the   financial system absorbed a result that had been assigned a 10% probability hours before. And it meant we   could credibly and immediately demonstrate to the public that we were well prepared.    We are buttressing the system via substantially higher bank capital. The capital of major UK banks has   tripled and the requirements for the most systemic global banks have increased ten-fold. Tier 1 is now at   16.5%. Capital that would have been adequate for banks to withstand any of the 20 largest historic banking   crises � and in the judgment of the Bank�s Financial Policy Committee, a Cliff Edge Brexit � and still lend to   the real economy.      22        Kouzes, J and Posner, B (2010)   23        ibid                                                                                                                  8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                 8   By using multiple stress tests, we are spending less time trying to predict what could go wrong and more   time being ready for the worst that could happen when things do.    And we are burying. The cornerstone of an anti-fragile financial system is literally planning for failure.   Remember: plan beats no plan. That means resolution plans for banks; Crisis Management Groups for 30   GSIBs; and having banks building sufficient internal resources to recapitalise themselves if something goes   wrong.    Large UK banks have already built their Total Loss Absorbing Capital to 25% of Risk Weighted Assets. And   major UK banks are on track to complete by January next year the separation of their domestic high street   businesses into �Ring Fenced Banks�.    ***********    Ambition. Purpose. Clarity. And Humility. Not all of these qualities are ever visible in any leader, certainly   never at the same time.    But if you keep them in mind, they will be seeds that the exercise of leadership will germinate. And their   growth will benefit both you as the leader and those you lead.    IV. Conclusion: Leadership in a Disruptive Age    Your opportunity is enormous.    You will assume the mantle of leadership at a time of unprecedented globalisation of trade, capital and   ideas; and at the dawn of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.    The deepening of the symbiotic relationship between global markets and technological progress has already   lifted more than a billion people out of poverty, while a series of technological advances have fundamentally   enriched our lives.    Globally, since 1960, real per capita GDP has risen more than two-and-a-half times, average incomes have                                                                                    24   begun to converge, and life expectancy has increased by nearly two decades.    Despite such immense progress, many citizens in advanced economies are lamenting a loss of control and   losing trust in the system. To them, measures of aggregate progress bear little relation to their own   experience. Rather than a new golden era, globalisation is associated with low wages, insecure employment,   stateless corporations and striking inequalities.    The fundamental challenge is that, alongside its great benefits, every technological revolution mercilessly   destroys jobs and livelihoods � and therefore identities � well before the new ones emerge.      24        Carney, M (2016)                                                                                                                 9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                               9   Moreover, recently, we have seen the power of networks to divide as well as to connect. Social media can   reinforce our tendency towards confirmation bias as we search out the information consistent with our priors                                          25   and disregard that which is not.    How to lead in such a world?    First, define your purpose and stick to it obsessively. And remember that purpose, including of business,   must be grounded in the objectives of clients, society and humanity. As John Kay has observed, �Profit is no                                                                                           26   more the purpose of business than breathing is the purpose of living.�    Second, in a world of division, fusion will bring breakthroughs. Select your teams wisely and recognise that   while diversity is a reality, inclusion is a choice. Take it.    Third, while you should always marshal your facts, you must engage people�s intuitions and win their trust in                                                                                                         27   order to convince them. Do this through empathy � the antidote to righteousness.                           Be open to dialogue and   remember Henry Ford�s advice that, �the secret of success is to see things from another person�s point of            28   view.�    Finally, do not confuse your leadership role with yourself or become addicted to the status and privileges of   power. Rather, recognise that all leadership is temporary, that you will be custodians of your institutions and   keepers of their flames.    And if possible, although it�s a bit late for me, take a cue from Cincinnatus and Washington, and leave before   you are asked.    Thank you.       25      As Haidt wrote, �People bind themselves into political teams that share moral narratives.

Figure 1: a �20 banknote       Significant because it honours Adam Smith, the great moral philosopher and hero of the Scottish   Enlightenment.    Significant because it is a significant amount of money, enough to buy you a burger and a few pints at the   Pear Tree pub this evening, or if you fancy a quieter but highly stimulating night in, copies of Smith�s Wealth   of Nations and The Theory of Moral Sentiments at Blackwell�s.    Significant because without money the decentralised exchange of Smith�s invisible hand could not operate.

Not just because you�re impoverished   students. Or because you live in Scotland where you�re more likely to encounter Sir Walter Scott or Nan                                                                   4   Shepherd on a banknote when you do have cash. But because you use electronic forms of money such as   debit cards and mobile phones for your everyday purchases and go online for your larger ones.    A number of you may hold other forms of electronic money � crypto or virtual currencies such as Bitcoin,   Ether or Scotcoin. And a few may view paper money � even the Bank of England itself � as archaic vestiges   of an old centralised order of payments that will soon be swept aside by a digital, distributed future.    And that�s my topic today: the future of money.    Specifically, how developments in money and payments technologies could transform our economy in ways   good and bad. And how, for the good of the people of the United Kingdom, the Bank of England is helping to   manage the potential risks and to realise the promise of the future of money.    What is money?    In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith defines money by the roles it plays in society, in particular, how well it   serves as:          -    A store of value with which to transfer purchasing power from today to some future time;          -    A medium of exchange with which to make payments for goods and services; and          -    A unit of account with which to measure the value of a particular good, service, saving or loan.    These functions of money operate in a hierarchy (Figure 2). There are many assets that people view as   stores of value � houses, for instance � that are not used as media of exchange. By comparison, an asset   can only act as a medium of exchange if at least two people are prepared to treat it as a store of value, at   least temporarily. And for an asset to be considered a unit of account, it must be able to be used as a                                                                                                                     5   medium of exchange across a variety of transactions over time between several people.    The hierarchy points to the reality that money is a social convention. We accept that a token has value   whether made of metal, polymer or code because we expect that others will also do so readily and easily.       4     These characters currently feature on banknotes issued by private banks in Scotland.   5     For this reason, some economists consider the operation as a unit of account to be the most important characteristic of money.   Indeed, it is commonly argued that a defining feature of monetary policy lies in central banks� control of the unit of account. See Ali, R.,   Barrdear, J., Clews, R. and Southgate, J., (2014) �The economics of digital currencies�, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, 2014 Q3.                                                                                                                                            3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                            3                                        Figure 2: The three functions of money       The tokens representing money have taken many forms over the millennia from cowry shells in ancient times   to cigarettes during the Second World War and mobile phone minutes in modern Kenya.    And so it was when the Bank of England was founded in 1694 by a Scot, William Paterson. Originally its   mission (�to promote the good of the people�) was fulfilled by issuing hand-written banknotes, backed by and   exchangeable into gold, to help finance King William III�s war with France.    By the late eighteenth century, fears of renewed Anglo-French conflict contributed to runs on the Bank which   drained its gold reserves and led to the suspension of convertibility of its notes into gold. This prompted an   MP to describe the Bank as �an elderly lady in the City who had�unfortunately fallen into bad company�. To   this day, the Bank of England is known as the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street.    It was not until the 1844 Bank Charter Act that the Bank of England�s note issuance responsibilities were                                                                                                                            6   formalised and the rights of others to issue notes in England and Wales began to be phased out. Today the   Bank is the sole issuer of banknotes in England and Wales, while a number of Scottish and Northern Irish   banks can issue notes provided that they are backed by Bank of England notes or funds on deposit at the                        7   Bank of England.    Most forms of money, past and present, have nominal values that far exceed their intrinsic ones. And this   gap has meant that money has a long and sorry history of debasement. Over the centuries, forms of private                                                                                                               th   money, such as the notes issued by American banks during the free banking of the 19 century, have   inevitably succumbed to oversupply and eventual collapse.       6    The last private bank to issue its own banknotes in England and Wales was Fox, Fowler and Company in 1921.   7    Seven banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland can issue banknotes. The Regulations specify that at least 60% of an authorised   bank�s notes in circulation must be backed by Bank of England notes and UK coin and that the remainder, plus all notes with the   potential to enter circulation, must be backed either by such notes and coin or by funds placed on deposit in an interest bearing account   at the Bank of England.                                                                                                                                         4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                         4   Adam Smith worried about the potential debasement of public money and for good reason. Throughout   history, governments would often betray the trust of their citizens be it Henry VIII reducing the precious metal   content of his coins during the Tudor era, Pitt the Younger depleting the gold vaults of the Old Lady during   the Regency period, or a pliant Reichsbank financing the government in Weimar Germany.    With the wisdom borne from such sad experience, most countries have now settled on centralised, public fiat   money backed by robust institutions in order to provide the public with money that is both highly trusted and   easy to use.    To understand the breadth of institutions needed for good money, it is important to recognise that modern   money takes three forms that are linked by retail and wholesale payments systems. Each link in the chain is   critical to the resilience of money. The first form of money is the banknotes issued by central banks, such as                                                                                                                                  8   the Adam Smith �20s. These account for just 3% of the stock but 40% of all consumer transactions. Next   is electronic central bank money in the form of the reserves that commercial banks hold with us, including to   settle transactions with one another. Finally, and most significantly, the electronic deposits that commercial                                                                                                                                  9   banks create when they extend loans to borrowers, accounting for fully 80% of money in the system.    The private financial sector cannot create money without limit, but is disciplined by competition, constrained   by prudential regulation, and limited by decisions of households and companies that can reduce the stock of   money (by, for example, repaying existing debt).    Monetary policy is the ultimate limit on money creation because it directly influences the price of money and                                                                                                                       10   other financial assets and therefore the demand for the money created by the private sector.    Most of the institutions that underpin sterling�s effectiveness as money are now housed in the Bank of              11   England.        In particular:          -    Our commitment to the highest quality banknotes that you and the publican can use with confidence.

To note, banknotes accounted for 45% of transactions in 2015, and as such there was a 5 percentage point fall   year-on-year which may be related to increased use of cards and online payments.   9     See McLeay, M., Radia, A., and Thomas, R., (2014), Money Creation in the Modern Economy, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin   2014 Q1, which notes that the reality of how money is created often differs from that found in standard textbooks, and rather than banks   receiving deposits when households save and then lending them out, bank lending creates deposits.   10      Although it does not target monetary aggregates per se, the Bank of England conducts monetary policy to ensure the amount of   money creation in the economy is consistent with low and stable inflation. In normal times, the Bank of England implements monetary   policy by setting the interest rate on central bank reserves. In exceptional times when interest rates cannot be lowered further, the Bank   implements monetary policy by purchasing assets, which has the by-product of increasing the central bank reserve holdings of private   banks.   11      Other institutions include legal tender status (meaning that you cannot be sued for non-payment of debts if you offer sterling to meet   them) and the insurance of deposits of up to �85,000 at banks and building societies backed by the Government.   12      This will feature JMW Turner.

The Bank has been given clear remits by Parliament for these responsibilities and has operational   independence to use its powers to achieve them. We are accountable to Parliament and the people for our   performance.    The combination of this robust institutional framework and the fact that only sterling is legal tender in the UK   sets a very high bar for competing forms of money to dislodge sterling.    But at present, more than a thousand virtual or �crypto� currencies are trying to do just that.    The Advent of Cryptocurrencies    In the depths of the global financial crisis, the coincidence of technological developments and collapsing   confidence in some banking systems sparked the cryptocurrency revolution.    Its advocates claim that a decentralised cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, is more trustworthy than centralised   fiat money because:        -    Its supply is fixed and therefore immune from the age-old temptations of debasement;         -    Its use is free from risky private banks; and         -    Those who hold it can remain anonymous and therefore free from the ravenous eyes of tax             authorities or worse still law enforcement.    Some also argue that cryptocurrencies could be more efficient than centralised fiat money because the   underlying distributed ledger technology cuts out intermediaries like central banks and financial institutions                                                                                           14,15   and allows payments to be made directly between payer and payee.      13      The Bank operates the Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) service and infrastructure that holds accounts for banks, building   societies and other institutions. The balances in these accounts can be used to move money in real time between these account   holders. This delivers final and risk-free settlement.   14      Whereas banks hold records of most fiat money and are entrusted to ensure its validity, with digital currencies, the ledger containing   all transactions by all users is publicly available. Rather than placing trust in central institutions � such as banks (and by extension the                                                                                                                                             6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                            6   In this spirit of dystopian fear and libertarian optimism, the message accompanying the first or genesis   Bitcoin block read: �The Times 3 Jan 2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.�    How well do cryptocurrencies fulfil the roles of money?    The answer has to be judged against the functioning of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem (which extends   beyond the currencies themselves to the exchanges on which cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold, the   miners who create new coins and verify transactions and update the ledger, and the wallet providers who   offer custodian services).    The long, charitable answer is that cryptocurrencies act as money, at best, only for some people and to a   limited extent, and even then only in parallel with the traditional currencies of the users.    The short answer is they are failing.    Poor Stores of Value    Cryptocurrencies are proving poor short-term stores of value. Over the past five years, the daily standard   deviation of Bitcoin was ten times that of sterling. Consider that if you had taken out a �1,000 student loan in   Bitcoin in last December to pay your sterling living costs for next year, you�d be short about �500 right now.   If you�d done the same last September, you�d be ahead by �2,000. That�s quite a lottery.    And Bitcoin is one of the more stable cryptocurrencies. Indeed, the average volatility of the top ten   cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation was more than 25 times that of the US equities market in 2017.    This extreme volatility reflects in part that cryptocurrencies have neither intrinsic value nor any external   backing. Their worth rests on beliefs regarding their future supply and demand�ultimately whether they will   be successful as money.    Thus far, however, rather than such a sober assessment of future prospects, the prices of many   cryptocurrencies have exhibited the classic hallmarks of bubbles including new paradigm justifications,   broadening retail enthusiasm and extrapolative price expectations reliant in part on finding the greater fool.    Far from being strengths, the fixed supply rules of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are serious deficiencies.   Fundamentally, they would impart a deflationary bias on the economy if such currencies were to be widely              16                                                                                      17   adopted.        If �those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it� , recreating a virtual global   gold standard would be a criminal act of monetary amnesia.      centralised authorities like the Bank of England that supervise them) � reliance is placed on the network and the rules to update the   ledger reliably.   15      Satoshi Nakamoto (2008), �Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System� bitcoin.org, October 2008.   16      For example, the supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21 million units by 2040. In the long run, a fixed money supply may harm the   macroeconomy by contributing to deflation in the prices of goods and services, and in wages. And the inability of the money supply to   vary in response to demand would likely cause greater volatility in prices and real activity.   17      As the Italian philosopher George Santayana famously observed.                                                                                                                                      7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                     7   In the short run, the fixed supply of Bitcoin has fed a global speculative mania that has encouraged a   proliferation of new cryptocurrencies. As my colleague Agustin Carstens has argued, this surge of                                                                                                                         18   competitors and the �forking� of Bitcoin echoes the debasement of private monies in the past.    Inefficient Media of Exchange    The most fundamental reason to be sceptical about the longer term value of cryptocurrencies is that it is not   clear the extent to which they will ever become effective media of exchange.    Currently, no major high street or online retailer accepts Bitcoin as payment in the UK, and only a handful of   the top 500 US online retailers do.    For those who can find someone willing to accept payment for goods and services in cryptocurrencies, the   speed and cost of the transaction varies but it is generally slower and more expensive than payments in   sterling.    That�s because the more heavily used cryptocurrencies face severe capacity constraints compared with   other payment systems. For example, Visa can process up to 65,000 transactions per second globally   against just 7 per second for Bitcoin.    And if you use a debit or credit card in the UK, the transaction is completed in seconds and without exchange   rate risk. In contrast, Bitcoin users can face queues of hours. Those wanting to get to the front to make   time-pressing payments � for last orders, for example � need to offer up a transaction fee sufficiently large to   persuade Bitcoin �miners�, who verify and process transactions, to do so quickly. The fees paid vary through   time, but reached �40 in late 2017. Fees are currently around �2, but even that is expensive relative to   cash, cards or online payments which cost the retailer around 1.5 pence, 8 pence and 19 pence                   19   respectively.    Over time, Bitcoin transaction fees could rise further because the subsidy miners enjoy by being partly paid                                                                                                                                              20   with rewards of new units of currency, will decline given the total supply of Bitcoin cannot exceed 21 million.   Furthermore, the costs of Bitcoin mining are enormous. Its current annual electricity consumption is                                                                                                                              21   estimated by some to be up to 52 terawatt hours, double the electricity consumption of Scotland.                                In   comparison, the global Visa credit card network�s energy use is less than � of 1% of that of Bitcoin, despite                                                        22   processing 9000 times more transactions.      18      Carstens, A., (2018), �Money in the Digital Age: What Role Central Banks?� See https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp180206.htm   19      Based on the British Retail Consortium�s Payment Survey 2016, which surveys the costs that retailers incur for accepting payments,   including bank charges, handling charges, infrastructure costs and write-offs (losses).

This regular halving of the block reward results in an exponential slow-down in the growth rate of Bitcoin supply. It is estimated   that by 2040 99.8% of total maximum Bitcoin supply will have been generated.   21      For Bitcoin energy usage, see: https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption.

Retailers that quote in Bitcoin usually update at very high frequency so as to maintain stable prices in   traditional currencies such as US dollars or sterling. The Bank is not aware of any business that accepts   Bitcoins in payments that also maintains its accounts in Bitcoin.    The Policy Response    Even though their prospects of replacing fiat money are tenuous at best, cryptocurrencies are of growing   interest to policymakers, many of whom prefer to term them crypto-assets expressly because they are not   true currencies�a convention I will adopt for the balance of my remarks.    On the upside, as I will come onto in a moment, some of the underlying technologies are exciting. Whatever   the merits of cryptocurrencies as money, authorities should be careful not to stifle innovations which could in   the future improve financial stability; support more innovative, efficient and reliable payment services as well                                    23   as have wider applications.    On the downside, at present, crypto-assets raise a host of issues around consumer and investor protection,   market integrity, money laundering, terrorism financing, tax evasion, and the circumvention of capital controls   and international sanctions.    The Bank of England�s FPC is currently considering the risks posed to UK financial stability. And   internationally the Financial Stability Board (FSB) will report to the G20 in Argentina later this month on the   financial stability implications of crypto-assets.    At present, in my view, crypto-assets do not appear to pose material risks to financial stability.    This is in part because they are small relative to the financial system. Even at their recent peak, their   combined global market capitalisation was less than 1% of global GDP. In comparison, at the height of the   dotcom mania, the valuations of technology stocks were closer to about a third of global GDP. And just prior   to the global financial crisis, the notional value of credit derivative swaps was 100%.    In addition, major UK financial institutions have minimal exposures to the crypto-asset ecosystem.    Looking ahead, financial stability risks could rise if retail participation significantly increased or linkages with   the formal financial sector grew without material improvements in market integrity, anti-money laundering   standards and cyber defences.     23     Innovations are reducing computational efforts to prove a transaction, such as Litecoin and Ethereum�s proposed moves to �proof of   stake� from �proof of work�.                                                                                                                                     9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                    9   Authorities are rightly concerned that given their inefficiency and anonymity, one of the main reasons for their                                          24   use is to shield illicit activities.        This cannot be condoned. Anarchy may reign on the dark web, but in the   UK it�s just a song that your parents used to listen to.    Moreover, structural vulnerabilities in cryptocurrencies mean that they are inherently risky compared with   traditional financial assets. The risks include extreme price volatility and poor market liquidity due to   fragmented markets and highly concentrated holdings, which in turn facilitate manipulation and misconduct.   These vulnerabilities are compounded by operational and technological weaknesses, as evidenced by a                                                 25   series of major crypto-asset heists.    In addition, there is unease that the combination of these vulnerabilities and widening retail participation   could damage the reputations of those financial intermediaries connected to crypto-asset markets. In   extreme circumstances, it could even undermine confidence in the broader financial system itself, particularly   if people held an unfounded belief that authorities had legitimised these activities.    To isolate, regulate or integrate?    Authorities need to decide whether to isolate, regulate or integrate crypto-assets and their associated   activities.                                                                         26   A few jurisdictions have banned crypto-assets outright.                   And some regulators have sealed off crypto-assets   from the core of the financial system in order to curtail risk of contagion. Most prominently, China�which   had been one of the most active crypto-asset markets�recently banned exchanges, financial institutions and   payment processors from handling them.    If widely adopted, however, isolation risks foregoing potentially major opportunities from the development of   the underlying payments technologies.    A better path would be to regulate elements of the crypto-asset ecosystem to combat illicit activities, promote   market integrity, and protect the safety and soundness of the financial system.    The time has come to hold the crypto-asset ecosystem to the same standards as the rest of the financial   system. Being part of the financial system brings enormous privileges, but with them great responsibilities.       24      The proportion of crypto-assets used for illicit activity remains hard to quantify. One academic study suggests that about a quarter of   Bitcoin users and one-half of all Bitcoin transactions are associated with illegal activity. Sean Foley, Jonathan R. Karlsen, and T?lis J.   Putni?� (2018), �Sex, Drugs, and Bitcoin: How Much Illegal Activity Is Financed Through Cryptocurrencies?� available at   http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3102645.   25      In February 2014, MtGox, the largest Bitcoin exchange at the time, revealed that around 850,000 of customers� Bitcoins, then valued   at around $450 million, were missing and had likely been stolen. In 2016, 120,000 units of Bitcoin valued at $72 million were stolen from   Bitfinex�s customer accounts. In January 2018, $530 million of cryptocurrency �XEM� was stolen from Japanese exchange CoinCheck.   In all cases, funds were stolen from �hot wallets�, where the private key is stored on a computer or device that is connected, directly or   indirectly, to the internet.   26      Cryptocurrencies have been banned in Bangladesh, Bolivia, Ecuador and Morocco.                                                                                                                                          10     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                          10   In this spirit, the EU and the US are requiring crypto exchanges to meet the same anti-money laundering and                                                                                             27   counter the financing of terrorism standards as other financial institutions.

2018-04-20	"A Transition in Thinking and Action      Remarks given by   Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England       International Climate Risk Conference for Supervisors, De Nederlandsche Bank,   Amsterdam    6 April 2018       I am grateful to Alice Carr, Edd Denbee, Tanveer Hussain, Carsten Jung, Krish Kistnassamy, Alex   Michie, Alex Ntelekos, Dimitris Papachristou and Matt Scott for their assistance in preparing these   remarks.                                                                                                          1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches   It is a great pleasure to be here in Amsterdam, at the International Climate Risk Conference for Supervisors,   jointly organised by the De Nederlandsche Bank, the Banque de France and the Bank of England.    In my remarks, I will take stock of the progress made in addressing climate-related financial risks since the   Paris Agreement of late 2015. In particular, I will consider how far there has been a transition in thinking and   action.    As we�ve heard today, the thinking has coalesced around three channels through which climate risk affects   financial stability:         -    the physical risks that arise from the increased frequency and severity of climate- and weather-             related events that damage property and disrupt trade;         -    the liability risks stemming from parties who have suffered loss from the effects of climate change             seeking compensation from those they hold responsible; and         -    the transition risks that can arise through a sudden and disorderly adjustment to a low carbon             economy.    The last risk is the most challenging. When I first spoke about the financial stability risks from climate                                                                                                                                   1   change, at Lloyd�s of London in 2015, I highlighted two paradoxes relating to transition risk in particular.    First, the future will be past. That is, climate change is a tragedy of the horizon which imposes a cost on   future generations that the current one has no direct incentive to fix. The catastrophic impacts of climate   change will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most actors. Once climate change becomes a clear and   present danger to financial stability it may already be too late to stabilise the atmosphere at two degrees.    The second paradox is that success is failure. That is, too rapid a movement towards a low-carbon economy   could materially damage financial stability. A wholesale reassessment of prospects, as climate-related risks   are re-evaluated, could destabilise markets, spark a pro-cyclical crystallisation of losses and lead to a   persistent tightening of financial conditions: a climate Minsky moment.    The tragedy of the horizon can be resolved in an orderly, effective and productive manner, however, with   early transitions in thinking and action.       1    See Carney (2015), �Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon � climate change and financial stability�, speech given at Lloyd�s of London,   September 2015.                                                                                                                                       2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                      2   A transition in thinking    Since 2015, a transition in thinking has taken place.    At the One Planet Summit in Paris in 2017, financial institutions responsible for managing US$80 trillion of   assets � equivalent to annual global GDP � publicly supported the Task Force for Climate-related                            2   Disclosures (TCFD).    The supporters included 20 globally-systemic banks, 8 of the top 10 global asset managers, the world�s   leading pension funds and insurers, the largest sovereign wealth fund and the two dominant shareholder   advisory service companies.    Established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in response to a call from G20 Leaders, the TCFD   delivered recommendations for voluntary disclosures of material, decision-useful climate-related financial   risks for the G20 Summit in Hamburg. Suitable for use by all companies that raise capital, the   recommendations:         -    include disclosure of governance and risk management arrangements;         -    establish consistent and comparable metrics applicable across all sectors, as well as specific metrics             for the most carbon-intense sectors; and         -    encourage use of scenario analysis so as to consider dynamically the potential impact of the risks             and opportunities of the transition to a low carbon economy on strategy and financial planning.    That financial institutions have come out so strongly in support of enhanced disclosure reflects their   recognition that there is a correlation between managing climate risk and long-term value creation as well as   their belief in the power of markets. They know that for markets to do what they do best � allocate capital   effectively and dynamically � they need the right information. When risks are unknown or ill-defined, the   market cannot allocate resources in an efficient and profitable manner.    Until recently, reliable information on how companies were anticipating, responding or failing to respond to   climate-related risks and opportunities has been hard to find, inconsistent and fragmented.       2    For a full list of current supporters see: https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/tcfd-supporters-march-2018/ and supporters at the Paris Summit see:   https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/TCFD-Press-Release-One-Planet-Summit-12-Dec-2017_FINAL.pdf                                                                                                                                         3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                        3   The information needed goes beyond the static to the strategic. Markets need information to assess which   companies are well positioned to seize the opportunities the transition to a low carbon economy brings.   Which car manufacturers are leading the way on fuel efficiency and electrification? How are energy   companies adapting their mix of energy sources? This needs to be considered against investors� views of   possible transition paths � the International Energy Agency�s Sustainable Development Scenario, for   example, sees the consumption of natural gas rise by nearly 20% by 2030 to become the largest single fuel                        3   in the global mix.    Given the uncertainties around climate, not everyone will agree on the timing or scale of the adjustments   required. And different people will have different views about the effectiveness of timelines of government   climate policies. The right information allows sceptics and evangelists alike to back their convictions with   their capital.    At the same time as this increased investor focus, there have been signs that global companies are   becoming increasingly aware of the risks climate change can pose. Whereas in previous years it barely   registered as a risk, now close to a third of global CEOs are �extremely concerned� about the threat climate                                                                      4   change poses to their organisation�s growth prospects.    A transition in action    So how far is this transition in thinking translating into action?    First, governments. In reaching agreement in Paris, global leaders took political action to mitigate the   catastrophic impact of climate change.    They committed to curbing carbon emissions to limit the rise in global average temperatures relative to those   in the pre-industrial world to 2�C, and to pursue additional efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5�C.    Governments are taking some of the necessary policy actions. For example, in the UK, the Government   published its Clean Growth Strategy last year, including policies to make homes, businesses and transport   more energy efficient, and to lower the carbon intensity of the UK�s energy supply. EU Emissions Trading   Scheme (ETS) reforms agreed last year, and due to come into effect from 2021, have driven carbon prices   above �10 per tonne for the first time in six years.    Even so, the national determined contributions towards meeting the Paris goals, summed to no more than   2.7�C, making it clear climate policy will need to tighten further if the Paris commitments are to be achieved.       3     It also sees US$69 trillion of investment in clean energy technologies and energy efficiency � and the share of oil and coal in power   generation falls to 6%, which is burned with accompanying carbon capture and storage technology.   4     See PWC (2018), 21st CEO Survey, The Anxious Optimist in the Corner Office, https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/2018/pwc-ceo-   survey-report-2018.pdf                                                                                                                                      4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                       4   Second, climate disclosures. There has been a series of actions to transform climate disclosures. 2017 was   a record year for climate-related shareholder resolutions, with a threefold increase in motions (184 vs 63)   and with investment managers controlling over 45% of global assets under management backing   shareholder actions on carbon disclosure.    Several of the world�s largest asset managers � including the two largest, Blackrock and Vanguard � have   written to a number of public companies calling for such disclosures. Other long-term investors have joined   forces to press for disclosure through groups such as Climate Action 100+ and the International Investors   Group for Climate Change (IIGCC). Meanwhile ISS and Glass Lewis, who account for over 90% of the   shareholder advisory services market, have updated their 2018 proxy voting policies to make clear that they                                                          5   will assess the adequacy of climate disclosure.    With the providers of capital demanding enhanced disclosure, and the TCFD recommendations providing a   framework for doing so, a number of public companies have begun disclosing their climate-related financial   risks for the 2017/18 year end. Reporters drawing on the TCFD include energy giants and extractors   through to financials and consumer goods companies.    The Task Force is delivering two initiatives to support this process. First, in time for the Argentine G20   Summit, drawing on the work of the Big Four accounting firms, the Task Force will report on implementation   experience, focusing on examples of good practice to foster wider adoption. Second, the Task Force is   launching a Resource Hub to provide technical support, data, and collaborative partnerships � all aimed at   helping companies implement the recommendations in as effective and efficient a manner as possible.    As preparers, financials and investors 'learn by doing�, a virtuous cycle will be created where more and better   information creates the imperatives for others to adopt the TCFD and for everyone to up their game on the   quality of information they provide.    This iterative process is a reason why there is likely cause for the Task Force to continue beyond the   Argentine Summit in late 2018 and into the Japanese presidency. In particular, it will be important to get   feedback from investors on which disclosures are truly decision useful so that this process is as efficient and   effective as possible.    Third, insurers and banks.    Insurers have long been on the front line of the physical risks posed by climate change such as extreme   weather events.    Since the 1980s, the number of registered weather-related loss events has tripled. Inflation-   adjusted insurance losses have increased from an annual average of around US$10bn in the     5    See ISS, (2018), United States Proxy Voting Guidelines, Benchmark Policy Recommendations, and Glass Lewis, (2018), Guidelines:   An Overview of the Glass Lewis Approach to Proxy Advice.                                                                                                                                5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                               5   1980s, to around US$55bn over the past decade (Chart 1).

(b) 10-year moving average   Source: Munich Reinsurance Company, Geo Risks Research, NatCatSERVICE      General and reinsurers insurers have long deployed sophisticated modelling of climate and   weather-related physical risks, and have adjusted their cover and business models accordingly.    Lloyd�s of London underwriters, for example, are required to consider climate change explicitly in   their business plans and underwriting models. Their genius has been to recognise that the past is   not prologue and that the catastrophic norms of the future are in the tail risks of today.    For example, by holding capital at a one-in-200 year risk appetite, under a forward-looking capital   regime, UK insurers were able to withstand the events of 2017, the worst year on record for   weather-related insurance losses at around US$130bn.    Given evidence that suggests increasing levels of physical risk, insurers will need to consider the   potential impact of more intense and clustered weather-related events. Work by Bank colleagues   finds that intense hurricanes, of the type most likely to cause large insurance losses, seem to be   getting more frequent and the chance of two or more intense hurricanes occurring close together                                                                                                                      6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                6                                                 6   may be higher than previously thought. So improvements in insurers� risk modelling must be   unrelenting.    While the ability to re-price annually or to withdraw cover can mitigate risks to general insurers in   the short-term, as climate change progresses, they will need to consider the longer-term impacts   on their business models.    And as the PRA found a few years ago in its review of the sector, insurers need to be wary of   cognitive dissonance within their organisations whereby risks that are managed prudently by their                                                                                                                  7   underwriters are ignored by the firm�s asset managers, such as in their real estate exposures.    Consistent with the tragedy of the horizon, the risks posed to banks from climate change have   tended to be beyond their planning horizons. A recent survey by the PRA of banks accounting for   around 90% of the UK banking system, found that these horizons averaged four years � before   physical and litigation risks would be expected to manifest, and prior to stringent climate policies   likely taking effect.    There are signs, however, that banks are beginning to treat climate-related risks like other financial   risks. The PRA survey finds that a majority of banks now see them as financial risks � rather than   just a reputational or corporate social responsibility issues. As such, oversight of climate-related   risks and overall responsibility for setting the climate risk strategy, targets and risk appetite has   been elevated to Board level.    Banks have begun considering the most immediate physical risks relevant to their business models   � from the exposure of mortgage books to flood risk or, for globally active banks, the impact of   extreme weather events on country risk. And they have begun to assess exposures to transition   risks where government policy is already pulling forward the adjustment. This includes exposures   to carbon-intensive sectors, consumer loans secured on diesel vehicles and buy-to-let lending   given new efficiency requirements.    But many banks have indicated that there is some way to go to identify and measure climate-   related risks more comprehensively, including given the need to improve data and expertise. This   includes developing their approaches to stress testing for climate-risks as well as, over longer   horizons, more dynamic scenario analysis. It is clear, however, that the TCFD framework is   helping, including to identify metrics and promote use of climate-related scenario analysis.       6     Bank Underground post, forthcoming,   7     See PRA (2015), The Impact of Climate Change on the UK Insurance Sector, https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-   regulation/publication/2015/the-impact-of-climate-change-on-the-uk-insurance-sector                                                                                                                            7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                          7   Fourth, financial policymakers.    At the Bank of England, the risks posed by climate change are currently most directly relevant to   our micro prudential responsibilities for the safety and soundness of the banking and insurance   sectors.    Assessing how well general insurers and reinsurers are identifying, measuring and mitigating   weather-related risks, has long been part of supervising insurers. We published a stocktake of   insurers� progress in adapting to climate change in late 2015, and are working to update and   deepen our assessment with a second stocktake in 2018. More recently, we have extended our   focus to the financial risks faced by the UK banking system, and will publish the full results of the   survey I referred to a moment ago in coming months.    The aim for both pieces of work is to consider whether insurers and banks have adequate   governance arrangements to develop strategies for identifying and mitigating climate risk across   their entire businesses, both their liabilities and assets, and over sufficiently long time horizons.   We aim to highlight examples of good practice and to articulate our supervisory expectations later   this year.    We are also considering our approach to assessing risks across the system as a whole.    The Bank has routinely included weather-related shocks in the scenarios for its biennial general   insurance stress test, including three North American hurricanes in 2017. This meant we had a   good sense of the likely resilience of the market and individual firms when Harvey, Irma and Maria                                                                       8   hit � both in terms of exposures and mitigating actions. On climate, remember, past is not   prologue. In the depressing spirit of Bayesian updating that the current climate change trajectory   demands, when considering scenarios for 2019, that we include weather-related events that are   more severe and clustered.    To help firms improve their own testing, the Bank has been encouraging knowledge sharing on the                                                                       9   types of scenario analysis envisaged under the TCFD. This will allow firms to explore how 2�C   and other transition scenarios might impact their strategy and financials.    More broadly, and like the other financial authorities represented here today, we recognise the   value in sharing expertise and best practice to increase the rate at which firms, and indeed   ourselves as regulators, move to embed more thoroughly climate-related financial risks into our risk   assessment and mitigation.       8    https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/letter/2017/general-insurance-stress-test-2017-feedback   9    This included co-hosting a conference with TCFD in late 2017.

There are, however, limits to our roles. Financial policymakers will not drive the transition to a low-   carbon economy. Our efforts cannot substitute for those of governments who have direct   responsibilities to deliver the policies to achieve their Paris commitments.    The good news is that governments are now establishing the policy frameworks, and the private   sector is beginning to allocate capital accordingly.    Our efforts will help smooth the transition prompted by these actions. With better information and   risk management as the foundations, a virtuous circle is being built with better understanding of   tomorrow�s risks, better pricing for investors, better decisions by policymakers and a smooth   transition to a low carbon economy.    Financing the transition to a low carbon economy is a major opportunity for investors and creditors.   It implies a sweeping technological revolution, including investments in long-term infrastructure at   roughly quadruple the current rate.    As this event testifies, climate finance and risk management is moving into the mainstream.    There has been a transition in thinking. And this is now beginning to be translated into action, and   the NGFS will play an important role in this.                                                                                                                 9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                           9"
2018-05-14	"Opening remarks at the econoME launch event   Remarks given by   Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England     Court Room, Bank of England   27 April 2018       I am grateful to Jennifer Nemeth for her assistance in preparing these remarks and to   David Bholat, Andreas Joseph and John Lowes for their work on the data analysis, and Rupal Patel, Emma   Sinclair and Ratidzo Starkey for their help on the background research.                                                                                                         1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches   Welcome    Good afternoon and welcome to the Bank of England.    We are here today to discuss the value of an economics education and to launch formally the Bank�s new   education outreach initiatives, in particular the teaching materials we have cleverly dubbed �econoME�.    We think economics education is important for three reasons:        1. It helps young people understand the world around them and equips them with the skills to make            important financial decisions throughout their lives;        2. It demystifies the Bank of England�s role, helping make what we do more effective while also            holding us to account; and        3. It can inspire more young people into careers in economics, finance and business, improving            diversity in these fields while fostering more sustainable growth for all.    The demand for improving economics education is there � over three quarters of the public believe that                                                  1   economics should be taught in schools. The supply isn�t. Only a third of schools offer children the option to                                              2   study economics from the age of 14.    To help on the supply side the Bank has developed an education outreach strategy with three components:        1. econoME: which includes free lesson plans and supporting materials for teachers to use in their            classrooms;        2. Bank Ambassadors: colleagues below the director level at the Bank who volunteer to visit schools            across the country to explain the Bank of England�s role; and        3. School visits by senior Bank and policy committee members: to spark young people�s interest            in economics and to inspire them to pursue a career in related fields.    Let me say a bit more about why we are doing this.       1     May 2017 survey conducted by ING and the Economics Network, available at:   https://www.economicsnetwork.ac.uk/research/understandingecon   2     See Haldane, A �Everyday Economics�, Birmingham 2017                                                                                                             2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                             2   The first objective is to help young people understand the economy and to make better informed   personal financial decisions.    The econoME lessons are designed for 11-16 year olds and cover:        -   The economic factors that influence personal decisions;        -   How to make informed decisions; and        -   How such decisions collectively influence the economy.    An array of econoME resources, designed in close collaboration with teachers and education specialists,   support these classes. The materials include lesson plans, presentations, videos, activities and real life case   studies. And they can be used by non-specialists with no prior economics training.    Our aim is to convince 400 schools across the country to download and teach the econoME materials in the   first year rising to about 1500 schools over three years. Already during the trial period over the past four   months, almost 300 schools have downloaded the resources, 250 of which were state schools.    We have also started discussing with examination bodies about how to develop resources similar to   econoME to support the GCSE and A-level economics syllabus by 2020. And we intend to develop   resources, including games, activity sheets and videos for primary school children over the next two years.    The second motivation of the Bank�s efforts is to help young people understand the Bank�s role in   managing the economy and hold us to account.    The Bank�s decisions affect every UK citizen whatever their age and wherever they live. We know that for   our policies to be effective, the Bank needs to be understood, credible and trusted. The challenge is that the   Bank�s work often requires deep technical skills and arcane knowledge, but not surprisingly, not everyone   wants to be steeped in fan charts, capital modelling and stress testing.    So recognising that we need to make our communications more accessible to the people we serve and in   order to connect with both the City and the country, the salon and the suburb; we are creating content that   engages different audiences through different channels.    Of course, these efforts will be more effective if people understand the basics of the Bank�s responsibilities.   And that�s part of what the econoME materials will teach young people.                                                                                                                      3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                3   To really bring the Bank�s work to life and give students a chance to hold us to account, colleagues below   director level from around the Bank are heading into classrooms across the country. These Bank   Ambassadors will visit over 200 state schools over the next twelve months. The feedback from the first 30   visits to state schools has been terrific. Central banks are not often associated with the words �positive�,   �appreciated� and �inspiring� so you can imagine how invigorated our Ambassadors are when they hear   them.    They�ve also been challenged with the length and quality of the questions they have had to face from some   students who appear to be candidates for future Treasury Select Committee membership.    Our third reason for creating an education strategy is to inspire economists of the future and thereby   improve diversity in finance, business and economics.    We hope to convince young people of the value of studying economics. We may be a bit biased but we know   it�s a fascinating subject and one that teaches skills that can open doors to a huge range of rewarding   careers.    And it�s achievable. As Keynes observed �the study of economics does not seem to require any specialised   gifts of an unusually high order.�    Yet, economists are still a rare breed.                                                                                                                           3   Last year, less than 0.1% of all GCSE students and 4% of A-level students studied economics.    Part of the problem is that because of its unfamiliarity, economics can seem unappealing. The Royal   Economics Society suggests people�s lack of enthusiasm for the dismal science is based on a narrow (and                                                            4   dry) perception of the subject and its masters.    As you might expect, I disagree. And so do most students, once we meet them. They are usually surprised   by the breadth of topics that economists consider. For example, colleagues are currently working on issues   such as the impact of Artificial Intelligence on the future of work, the role of the financial system in   combatting climate change, and the value of diversity in decision making .A quick visit to our Bank   Underground blog will reveal articles on the impact of mental health, crypto currencies and driverless cars on   jobs, growth, inflation and wellbeing.    A more disturbing impediment to the study of economics is the imposter syndrome. There is a perception   that economics is �not for people like me� not least because the profession lacks diverse role models. And   this challenge is reinforced by the limited opportunities available for students to study economics.    3     Joint Council for Qualifications, 2017 GCSE and A-Level results, available at: https://www.jcq.org.uk/examination-   results/gcses/2017/gcse-full-course-results-summer-2017/gcse-full-course-results-summer-2017 and Joint Council of Qualifications,   2017 A-level results, available at: https://www.jcq.org.uk/examination-results/a-levels/2017/main-results-tables/a-as-and-aea-results-   summer-2017   4     Royal Economic Society Newsletter, issue 180, January 2018                                                                                                                                            4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                          4   As a consequence, the economics profession is not as diverse as it should be. Just under a third of students                                      5                                                                      6   studying economics to A-level and undergraduate level in British Universities are female. Women account   for 25% of all academic staff in UK economics departments, and only one in seven are professors (compared                           7   to one in three men).    And while ethnic minorities are over-represented among economics undergraduates (30% of students                                8   identify as black or Asian compared to 10% of the whole UK population) they are still under-represented at   senior management level in business and finance. At the Bank, our BAME senior representation is 6%.    At undergraduate level in university, over a fifth of economics students are from privately funded schools,                                                                                                       9   even though privately educated young people account for only 7% of the population.    This is a problem � above all, of missed opportunities for the students but also of missed opportunities for the   profession.    The Bank of England values diversity in our ranks for three reasons. First, it is the right thing to do; a public   institution should reflect the people it serves. Second, it can build trust by reducing misperceptions that we   are experts making esoteric decisions in ivory towers for the benefit of others. Third, it is well established that   diversity leads to more creative thinking and reduces the risks of groupthink and bias.    This last point is critical. Almost all decisions in finance are taken under uncertainty, making it especially   important that decision makers are exposed to a range of views, with open debates and perspectives that   challenge the prevailing wisdom.    That is one reason why our education outreach efforts are focused on improving diversity in the field, with the   aim of attracting state school, BAME and female students into the subject.    To reinforce this message and to complement the impact of econoME and the Bank Ambassadors, senior   Bank officials and policy committee members, myself included, will visit 50 schools this year. We aim to give   young people a glimpse into a life in economics and the enormous opportunities in financial services and   businesses for people just like them. Perhaps a few will even be inspired to be the central bankers of the   future.    When I visit a school, my message is pretty simple: if someone like me, born in the Arctic and educated at   state schools, can be Governor of the Bank of England, why not you?     5     Joint Council for Qualifications, 2017 GCSE and A-Level results, available at: https://www.jcq.org.uk/examination-   results/gcses/2017/gcse-full-course-results-summer-2017/gcse-full-course-results-summer-2017   6     HE student enrolments by subject of study 2016/17 available at: https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/students/table-9   7     Tenreyro, S, Royal Economic Society�s Report on The Gender Balance in UK Economics Departments and Research Institutes in   2016 (published 2017).   8     HESA, Who's studying in HE?

A while back I received a letter from a mother following a visit to a school near Hull.   She told of the new determination in her son to achieve what I had. The words she etched and underlined   on the paper �these visits can change lives� is motivation enough to get out from the confines of the Bank�s   four walls.    To build diversity, the Bank will continue its work with local schools to attract young people hitherto   underrepresented in central banking. A decade ago the Bank only offered work experience to children of   friends and family. Last year we offered 75 work experience placements to children from lower   socioeconomic backgrounds. The Bank also supports several school mentoring programmes that aim to                                                                                        10   raise aspirations of students from lower socio economic backgrounds.                      We also offer on the job training   through our Central Bank Qualification and award scholarships to young African Caribbean students.    Our Early Careers Recruitment Team is engaging with schools across the UK through a series of   presentations and careers conventions to demystify work at the Bank and to open up the recruitment process   more generally. Over 90% of these sessions are held at state schools, reaching 1000 students last year   alone.    We now recruit at 40 universities across the country (four times as many as a decade ago). Last year, two   fifths of our graduate intake was female, a quarter came from a BAME background and a tenth from lower   socio-economic groups.    Conclusion    One of the things economists like to focus on is return on investment. For the modest investment the Bank   has made to develop econoME - �80,000 - we hope to reach over 100,000 young people directly by 2020,   with a multiplier effect through word of mouth and social media. And we know that our efforts will   complement and reinforce those of TaechFirst, NowTeach, Young Citizens, Speakers for Schools, the Social   Mobility Foundation and many other initiatives that are improving mathematical and financial literacy and   inspiring students to broaden their horizons.

Note the conditionality of the phrase �potential paths.� The actual path for policy will depend   on the outlook for the economy which in turn will depend very much on how the Brexit negotiations evolve.    Monetary policy is always contingent on the economic outlook. This is broader than it being data dependent.   In order to achieve the inflation target, monetary policy needs to adjust not only to news about current                                                                                   1   conditions but also to any changes in likely future circumstances. While it may be the MPC that sets   interest rates, it is ultimately the economy that determines them.    Monetary policy will be most effective if agents can anticipate how policymakers will react to changing   conditions. But the predictability of monetary policy can break down when there are large structural changes   in:          -   Supply capacity;         -   Equilibrium interest rates; or         -   Trading relationships.   In such circumstances, forward guidance can help anchor expectations and improve the effectiveness of   monetary policy.    This generally wasn�t necessary during the Great Moderation, when the economy was largely subject to a   series of demand shocks. The inflation target could be achieved without causing undesirable volatility in                                                                      2   output and employment (so-called �divine coincidence� ).    Despite the crisis, divine coincidence has continued to reign in the euro area and the US (see charts in the   Appendix). Large output gaps and below-target inflation have pointed monetary policy in the same direction.    That, unfortunately, has not been the case in the UK economy, which has been subject to a series of major   supply shocks over the past five years, creating tensions between short-term output and inflation   stabilisation. Brexit is the latest and potentially largest example.    Brexit is a regime shift that has markedly increased the range of possible outcomes for the UK economy and   therefore the potential paths of monetary policy.       1     Another dimension to uncertainty is �model� uncertainty around the structure of the economy. That is distinct from uncertainty about   possible future events, or �shocks�, affecting economy. Model uncertainty captures uncertainty around how the economy responds to   those events, including to changes in monetary policy itself.   2     See Blanchard, O., and J. Gal� (2007).

As the Brexit process continues and the answers to these questions become clearer, the MPC will adapt its   specific guidance and monetary policy more broadly in order to meet the inflation target.    My message this evening is straightforward. From a monetary policy perspective, the Bank of England is   ready for Brexit whatever form it takes.    The role of guidance and the UK experience    Before turning to Brexit, I would like to review briefly the MPC�s experience with forward guidance.    The objective of forward guidance is to give insights into the MPC�s reaction function � in other words, how   the Committee will adjust policy when the outlook for growth and inflation changes.    In a perfect world, guidance would be redundant. People would know how the MPC intends to set rates over   the future and how those intentions would adjust to economic developments in all eventualities � the   so-called reaction function. But the world is complex and people don�t have endless time to devote to   understanding monetary policy. In practice, therefore, guidance can be useful in providing people with   information about how the MPC sets policy and, over time, in improving understanding of how monetary   policy will adjust to news.    Guidance thus helps people to think along with the Committee so that their expectations about the path of   policy adapt with ours as economic circumstances change. This can make monetary policy more effective   by reducing unwarranted volatility in interest rate expectations and the extent to which the MPC has to move   Bank Rate to meet the inflation target. The more those expectations are aligned with the policy path   necessary to achieve the inflation target, the higher the probability that policy objective will be achieved.    Guidance is not a promise of the future path of policy. And its use will not mean that all observers will agree   on the likely path of policy for the simple reason that not everyone will agree on the likely path for the   economy. However, with guidance, someone who has a different outlook can better anticipate how the MPC   will adjust once the scales fall from the Committee�s eyes. Again it is the combination of the economy and   the primacy of the inflation target, not the MPC, that ultimately determines that path of policy.                                                                                                                     3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                 3   The MPC�s guidance speaks first and foremost to UK households and businesses. This is particularly   important during large structural or regime shifts when uncertainty is high. In the wake of financial crises or   advance of wholesale changes to trading relationships, people�s expectations for monetary policy can   understandably diverge from its most likely path to the detriment of the economy�s performance. Guidance is   most useful at such turning points.    The views of economists and financial market participants are, of course, central to the transmission   mechanism from Bank Rate, set by the MPC, to the various interest rates facing households and businesses   and to asset prices more generally.    Guidance can reinforce the transmission mechanism by reducing unnecessary uncertainty � not eliminating                     3   all uncertainty. It is not the same as guaranteeing the future stance of monetary policy. Indeed, market   participants can be expected to pay the closest attention to any explicit conditionalities around guidance and   should usually be the first to update their expectations of policy as the outlook for the economy changes.    Finally, guidance should be seen in the context of a series of MPC initiatives to increase transparency. In   recent years, the MPC has made major structural changes to our communications ranging from publishing   statements each time we meet to the simultaneous release of Minutes, Inflation Reports and Monetary Policy   Summaries on Super Thursdays to the provision of the detailed assumptions underlying our projections. And   last year, we introduced layered communications, with simpler, more accessible language and graphics to   reach the broadest possible audience.    Crucially, the Committee has also initiated an annual stock take of the supply side of the economy. It now   publishes its best collective judgments on the natural rate of unemployment, the output gap, as well as the   expected growth in productivity, labour supply and potential output.    To draw out these points consider three examples of forward guidance by the MPC.    The first occurred five years ago when the economy began to recover from the worst downturn since the   Great Depression. During previous periods of accelerating growth and firming business confidence, the   MPC had always tightened policy significantly (as evidenced in the correlation between survey indicators and   MPC votes seen in Chart 1). On the basis of this past behaviour, the MPC would have raised interest rates   by 2 to 3 percentage points between August 2013 and the end of 2014. For anyone who might suggest the   MPC should have followed that reaction function, note that, even on unchanged policy, CPI inflation in the   summer of 2016 was running at only about �% and core CPI inflation around 1�%.       3    In other words, the amount of volatility in interest rates should match the amount of uncertainty surrounding the economy. There   should ideally be no additional volatility, or risk premium, due to uncertainty about how policy would respond.                                                                                                                                       4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                     4   Chart 1: Close correlation pre-crisis between output growth and policy         3 month moving average,                                                          3 month moving average,       65       balance                                                                            bps       50                                                                            Combined CIPS output       60                                                                   survey (LHS)                     25        55                                                                                                                 0        50                                                                                                                 -25        45                                                                                                                 -50        40                                                                                                                 -75                                                                        Average MPC vote, including QE       35                                                                                                                 -100                                                                        (RHS)       30                                                                                                                 -125         1998    2000       2002       2004       2006       2008       2010       2012       2014    2016      2018     Sources: IHS Markit, ONS and Bank calculations.

Average MPC vote includes both decisions on Bank Rate and QE, with every extra �25bn of asset purchases (gilts and corporate   bonds) treated as equivalent to a 25bp cut in Bank Rate (see Joyce, Tong and Woods, 2011).     Five years ago, the MPC recognised that past should not be prologue. The MPC was pretty certain there   was a large amount of slack, although it had questions over how much productive capacity had been   destroyed following the crisis; how quickly productivity growth would recover; and whether labour supply   would change in the wake of reforms and a heavy burden of household debt.    Such uncertainties about supply meant that knowing what was happening to demand was no longer   sufficient for gauging the appropriate policy response. The historic reduced-form reaction function of the   Committee, based on demand alone, would have been a poor guide to the expected path of policy.    That is why the Committee provided forward guidance that explicitly linked any potential change in interest                                                                                                                      4   rates to the unemployment rate � a clear and widely understood indicator of the degree of slack. The   Committee�s objective was to secure the nascent recovery while learning more about the supply capacity of   the economy.    The message the Committee gave UK households and businesses was simple: the MPC would not even   think about tightening policy at least until the unemployment rate had fallen below 7%, consistent with the   creation of around three quarter of a million jobs. We reassured households and businesses that, after five   years of decline and stagnation, the recovery would not be choked off prematurely.    That guidance was effective. Surveys conducted in the months that followed indicated high awareness of it   among companies, with almost half reporting that they expected Bank Rate to remain at low levels for longer   than they would have done were guidance not in place. And the majority said that the Bank�s policy   4    For the full text of the guidance, see the minutes of the August 2013 MPC meeting, available at   https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/minutes/2013/monetary-policy-committee-august-2013.                                                                                                                                    5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                  5   guidance had made them more confident about UK economic prospects. Household expectations also                                                                               5   shifted markedly in favour of fewer and later rate increases. Household and business confidence continued   to strengthen, reinforcing the economic momentum.    In the event, the unemployment rate fell far faster than we had expected, falling below 7% in February 2014.    But even as the recovery strengthened and survey indicators of output growth reached levels previously   associated with sharp policy tightenings (Chart 1), market expectations about the future path of policy   remained subdued (Chart 2). Participants understood the conditionality of guidance, as they and the MPC   learned that there was still considerable spare capacity in the economy.

It observed that the   appropriate path of interest rate increases to eliminate slack and keep inflation close to the target was    5     For more information, see the box on page 12 of the February 2014 Inflation Report.   6     This is the policy rate that, if allowed to prevail for several years, would keep economic activity at potential and inflation at target.   7     Secular drivers that had pushed down the equilibrium rate prior to the crisis � including slower potential growth, demographic forces,   changes in income distribution and excess saving in emerging markets � were likely to persist. Colleagues at the Bank of England   estimate that these factors can explain around 400 of the 450 basis points fall in global long-term equilibrium rates since the 1980s (see   Rachel, L and Smith, T (2015), �Secular drivers of the global real interest rate�, Bank of England Working Paper No. 571). In addition,   more cyclical factors, such as the protracted process of balance sheet repair in both public and private sectors, had weighed further on   the equilibrium real rate, causing it to turn sharply negative during the downturn. The MPC expected these forces to fade only gradually   as the economy recovered.

Out of that guidance came the phrase �limited and gradual�, so often repeated it has now become part of the   monetary policy furniture. Importantly, it is widely recognised by UK households and businesses whose   expectations of rate increases have remained well anchored as the recovery has progressed (Charts 3b and   3c) as well as by financial markets (Chart 3a). Similar guidance was subsequently adopted by the FOMC               8   and ECB.

This incredible Fosters + Partners building connects the Roman Temple of Mithras in its foundations to the   glories of St. Paul�s in its vista, while pushing the boundaries of sustainable office design.    It is a node in a global network that spins data, information, and capital instantaneously across the planet.    We have been reminded in recent years that networks have the power to divide, as well as connect. And we   are here today to continue the process of reconnecting financial markets to the real economy.    Three years ago, in the wake of a series of scandals ranging from mis-selling to manipulation, and following   a period when markets had become ever more connected to each other but disconnected from those they   serve, the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority and HM Treasury published the                                                                                    1   recommendations of the Fair and Effective Markets Review (FEMR).    FEMR was ground-breaking and ambitious in its recommendations to restore trust in the markets on which   we all depend.    At today�s event, policymakers and market participants will take stock of the progress in building fair and   effective markets. And we will consider how to maintain focus as memories fade and the temptation to turn   inwards returns.    We are doing so because we know that everyone has a shared interest in real markets.    Real markets are professional and open.    They are resilient, fair and effective, and they maintain their social license.    Real markets are not ends in themselves but serve the interests of end-users.    Real markets don�t just happen. They depend on private actors and public initiatives to ensure the quality of   market infrastructure.    That includes �hard� infrastructure, the plumbing of markets that determines the mechanics of markets; and   �soft� infrastructure, like standards and codes that define how market participants should behave.    Since the crisis, the UK has played a leading role in addressing misconduct in domestic and global markets.       1    See Fair and Effective Markets Review Final Report, HM Treasury, Bank of England and FCA (June 2015). At:   https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/report/2015/fair-and-effective-markets-review---final-report                                                                                                                    2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                 2   We know that the City has a particular responsibility given London�s position as the pre-eminent global                       2   financial centre.    What has been achieved?                                                                                                                               3   So what has been done to re-build the necessary market infrastructures for real markets to thrive?    In the UK, laws and regulations have been strengthened by, for example, introducing a criminal regime for   manipulating benchmarks.    Public authorities know they cannot and should not try to legislate for every circumstance, monitor every   transaction, or anticipate every market innovation. As FEMR recognised, while fines and sanctions have   roles in deterring misconduct, they will not, on their own, bring about the cultural change needed.    We must move from an excessive reliance on punitive ex post fines of firms to greater emphasis on more   compelling ex ante incentives for individuals, and ultimately a more solid grounding in improved firm culture.    This starts with reducing opportunities for bad behaviour, for example, by overhauling the regulation of key   benchmarks in FICC markets.    It requires compensation rules that align risk and reward. In the UK, a significant proportion of variable   compensation now must be deferred for a period of seven years.    To address the �rolling bad apples� problem, mechanisms are now in place here to ensure that when   individuals move on their history will be known to those who consider hiring them. Firms will be required to   share information on breaches of individual conduct rules, their fitness and propriety assessments and   outcomes around subsequent disciplinary proceedings.    These measures are all very constructive but they are not yet sufficient. That�s why the Bank of England   supports initiatives that ensure firms and their employees take greater responsibility � individually and   collectively � for their own conduct.    UK authorities have used their convening powers to encourage market participants to establish standards of   market practice that are well understood, widely followed and, crucially, that keep pace with market   developments.    Industry has responded. The Banking Standards Board is promoting higher standards of conduct and   competence across the UK banking system. The global FICC Market Standards Board (FMSB) is   2     The UK accounts for 40% of both global FX volumes and trades in OTC interest rate derivatives, and two-thirds of trading in   international bonds. More international banking activity is booked in London than anywhere else. And finance is one of the largest   sectors of the UK economy. Around 400,000 people are employed in financial services in London alone, 1.1 million across the country   as whole. Their enterprise contributes �115 billion to our national income, �80 billion to our exports and �70 billion to the Exchequer,   equivalent to two-thirds of the NHS budget.   3     This is set out in more detail in the FEMR Progress Report being published today at: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/fair-   and-effective-markets                                                                                                                                         3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                        3   establishing readily understood standards for their markets. And the global FX Committees have published   the FX Global Code, the first globally consistent code of conduct for FX markets.    But codes are of little use if nobody reads, follows or enforces them.                                                                                   4   This is where the UK�s Senior Managers Regime (SMR) comes in.    Senior Managers Regime    The SMR gives teeth to voluntary codes by incentivising firms to develop, adopt and embed them. It is very   welcome that the FCA is currently consulting on proposals to recognise industry codes publicly under the   SMR.    By requiring identification of the most senior decision-makers, the SMR re-establishes the link between   seniority and accountability, strengthens individual accountability, and reinforces collective responsibility.    As the SMR starts to bed in, there are encouraging signs that it is making a difference.    For firms, the SMR is clarifying and improving governance, accountability and decision-making. For   supervisors, the regime is helping identify weaknesses in governance and accountability, and it is helping   them to encourage the necessary changes.    Adoption is spreading. Some international firms are voluntarily adopting elements of the SMR�s certification   requirements to strengthen their global operations. A number of jurisdictions are applying the principles and                           5   features of the SMR.        And elements of the regime are included as examples in the FSB�s recently published                                            6   toolkit on governance frameworks.    While we cannot eliminate misconduct, these measures should reduce its scale and frequency, and they will   broaden the sanctions for bad behaviour. All of this will help restore trust in financial markets so that they   can work as effectively and efficiently as possible to serve the real economy.    Markets Forum 2018    Today marks an inflection point, when we can celebrate what has been achieved but then look ahead to   future challenges.    The spirit and intention behind FEMR is that continual focus is required because markets continually evolve.    4     The Government has legislated to extend the SM&CR to all other FSMA authorised financial services firms. As a first step, the   Government will extend the Regime to insurance firms from 10 December 2018 and will confirm when the Regime will be extended to   firms regulated solely by the FCA in due course.   5     The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission implemented a Manager in Charge Regime (MICR); the Australian Parliament has   recently passed legislation establishing a Bank Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR); and the Monetary Authority of Singapore has   published Proposed Guidelines on Individual Accountability and Conduct   6     The FSB Report on Strengthening Governance Frameworks to Mitigate Misconduct Risk can be found here: http://www.fsb.org/wp-   content/uploads/P200418.pdf                                                                                                                                   4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                   4   That�s why the Bank and the FCA are taking a proactive, forward-looking approach to identifying   vulnerabilities in hard and soft market infrastructure. We see this as core to our institutional responsibilities.   Indeed, the Bank has made catalysing structural reforms in financial markets, such as the new risk-free   benchmarks that I�ll turn to in a moment, one of its core strategic goals.    But the authorities cannot future-proof alone. We rely on industry to help us scan the landscape for   emerging risks and to help determine ways to mitigate them.    We are encouraged by your efforts. In particular, the FMSB is undertaking horizon scanning for future   misconduct risks through its innovative behaviour cluster analysis; and the Global Foreign Exchange   Committee, which is responsible for keeping the FX Global Code �alive�, has already identified areas of                                                       7   further work on spot FX market practices.    With the leaders of the industry here, we hope that today�s discussions will identify emerging risks and   challenges, and explore how we can all work together to address potential vulnerabilities as we continue to   build real markets for the good the people of the UK and beyond.    In this spirit, before concluding, I want to briefly touch on one of the biggest challenges facing us right now �   the transition to Risk Free Rates.    The move to new Risk Free Rates    Libor is a prime example of critical hard (market) infrastructure that has not kept up with market   developments. Libor is meant to measure the short-term unsecured funding costs of banks. But the reality   is that, since the financial crisis, Libor really has become the rate at which banks don�t lend to each other.    Bank funding markets have changed enormously. Banks no longer take sufficient short-term wholesale   deposits to form the basis for a robust transaction-based Libor benchmark.    As a result Libor is overly reliant on expert judgement rather than actual transactions. And global markets   remain overly reliant on Libor, a benchmark that may not exist beyond 2021. That reliance is neither   desirable nor sustainable.    That�s why authorities internationally have worked with market participants to identify alternative benchmarks   based on actual transactions. These are overnight rates � a relatively pure read on risk-free rates in each   economy.    In sterling, the market has chosen SONIA, a benchmark now administered by the Bank of England. In April   we implemented reforms to SONIA that boosted the volume of transactions captured by a factor of three to   �50bn per day.    7    These areas are: the role that �cover and deal� and similar trading models play in the FX market; how market participants adjust their   pricing on E-Trading Platforms and when trading by voice; and, disclosures regarding last look practices.                                                                                                                                         5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                       5   The focus now is on transition. Market participants in every sector and market that use Libor now need to   come together to identify and resolve issues, change business practices, and adopt alternative benchmarks.   In sterling, over 90 institutions, including banks, law firms, corporates, asset managers, trade associations   and infrastructure firms, are directly involved in this effort supported by the Bank and FCA.    Transition to SONIA will bring a number of benefits.    Market participants can have the confidence that SONIA faithfully represents conditions in a deep underlying   market.    They can also be assured that SONIA�s design is robust to future changes in money markets because, if   necessary, SONIA�s data inputs can evolve.    Near risk-free rates like SONIA are a better reflection of the general level of interest rates than Libor � which   is affected by fluctuations in the perceived credit quality of banks (as well as other technical factors as seen   recently). Interest payments for benchmark users should be less volatile as a result, especially in times of   stress, and products referencing SONIA should provide a better hedge for duration risk.    Over time the private sector will develop a wider range of products referencing SONIA. Futures contracts   have already been created. We can expect Floating Rate Notes and loans referencing SONIA to follow. The   end point should be an ecosystem for interest rate markets which has an altogether healthier foundation than   at present.    Developing the infrastructure around the near risk-free benchmarks globally, and assisting market   participants in dealing with legacy Libor portfolios, is a significant opportunity for innovation. Firms here in   London are well placed to take advantage.    As mentioned, international authorities are working closely together, and I know Bill Dudley is going to pick   up the baton and talk more about the transition to risk-free rates from a US perspective.    It is an immense pleasure to introduce Bill.    It is an honour that he is here at this Markets Forum to give his last keynote speech as President of the New   York Federal Reserve. And it is appropriate given his deep commitment to fighting misconduct and   improving standards of behaviour in the institutions we regulate and supervise. Bill had the wisdom to   appreciate quickly how cultural and ethical issues lay at the heart of the global financial crisis, and he has   been a consistent and strong voice in arguing for what needs to be done to improve individual behaviour,   firm culture, and industry ethics.    On behalf everyone, I would like to thank you Bill for your many, invaluable contributions throughout this   exceptional period for financial markets and the global economy.                                                                                                                        6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                    6   On a personal note, I will greatly miss your deep technical expertise, open-mindedness, wisdom, good   humour and friendship. Today isn�t really goodbye but au revoir.    Because, whether it is the financial system or as colleagues, we know the future will be better if we stay   connected.                                                                                                                    7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                              7"
2018-06-27	"New Economy, New Finance, New Bank   Speech given by   Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England       The Mansion House   21 June 2018       I am grateful to Clare Macallan, Alice Carr and James Benford for their assistance in preparing these   remarks, and to Nathana�l Benjamin, Andrew Hauser, Carsten Jung, Cordelia Kafetz, Tom Mutton,   and Rhys Phillips for background research and analysis.                                                                                                            1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches   I. Introduction    In recent years, this annual Mansion House dinner has been rightly cancelled in the wake of national   tragedies. Two years ago, we were united in defiance after an attack on our democracy, and more   profoundly in sorrow and admiration for Jo Cox MP, a remarkable woman who had dedicated her life to   helping others. Last year, we were united in grief following the terrible fire at Grenfell Tower which claimed   so many lives and scarred so many more. And we were united in determination that such a tragedy should   never happen again.    Prior to this, the only other times Mansion House had not been held since its inception in 1877 were during   the World Wars.    When the dinner resumed in 1920, the then Governor Montagu Norman emphasised the unity that the City   needed in order to return to normal.    Norman�s particular unity was around �the policy� proposed by the Bank of England. He believed �the policy   was the one and only policy which ultimately would place the City and the country again on that eminence   which it occupied before the war�.    Such was his confidence that Norman mentioned only once, in passing, that �the policy� in question was to   �attempt to regain the gold standard�, and he spent no time at all explaining what, apart from normalcy,   would be achieved by it.    Of course, this return to past certainties would eventually plunge the country into deflation and a deep   recession. The old policy was not suited to the new normal and the UK was forced to abandon it a few years   later.    After all, what is normal when there are tectonic shifts?    This dinner may look traditional, but its attendees have always recognised that the most longstanding and   revered tradition of the City is its ability to anticipate, adapt to and accelerate change for the common good.    That is why the UK�s financial system remains both a national asset and a global public good.    Domestically, there are over 1 million financial services jobs, two-thirds outside London. Financial services   run a trade surplus of 3% of GDP, while the rest of the economy runs a deficit almost twice as large. Last   year, the UK financial system channelled �300 billion in finance to UK businesses and helped 700,000   households to purchase homes. It provides pensions to 21 million people and insures the contents of 20                                                                                                                       1   million homes. It contributed 11% of annual tax revenues or over �1� billion per week in 2016.       1    Employment and tax data is from �Total tax contribution of UK financial services, Tenth edition�, City of London & PWC, November   2017. Lending data from Bank of England statistics and calculations.                                                                                                                                       2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                     2   Internationally, the UK is the pre-eminent financial centre. It accounts for 40% of global foreign exchange   volumes and trades in over-the-counter interest rate derivatives. More international banking activity is   booked here than anywhere else. The UK hosts the world�s second largest asset management and fourth   largest insurance industry. The City is Europe�s investment banker, and it is leading the internationalisation   of green, Islamic, renminbi and rupee finance.    Being at the heart of the global financial system reinforces the ability of the rest of the UK economy, from   manufacturing to the creative industries, to compete globally. And it broadens the investment opportunities   and risk-adjusted returns for UK savers.    This evening, I want to set out some of the ways the UK financial system can continue to serve the UK and   the world in the face of major structural changes.    II. Core attributes of UK leadership    The City�s pre-eminence reflects lessons learnt over the centuries that an effective financial system must be   resilient, fair and dynamic.    Resilient so that it can finance households and businesses through good times and bad. A resilient system   is anti-fragile � robust even to risks we do not anticipate.    To this end, we have comprehensively reformed the financial system since the crisis. Both capital   requirements and contingent liquidity have increased ten-fold. The major UK banks now have the balance   sheets to withstand a disorderly cliff-edge Brexit, however unlikely that may be. A series of measures have   eliminated toxic forms of shadow banking and are transforming the rest into resilient market-based finance.    An effective financial system is fair: fair to end-users and fair to the taxpayers who provide the ultimate   backstop to the system.    Fairness requires markets that are professional and open, in which everyone is accountable for their actions.    That is why the UK has led the global effort to address misconduct and restore trust in financial markets. We   have sharpened incentives through compensation rules that align risk and reward. The Senior Managers   Regime has re-established the link between seniority and accountability. And the private sector is   developing standards of market practice that are well understood, widely followed and up-to-date with market                    2   developments.    An effective financial system is dynamic. With the foundations of resilience and fairness reinforced, the UK   financial sector is innovating to serve the changing real economy just as it did during three industrial   revolutions and two waves of globalisation.     2    The global FICC Market Standards Board (FMSB) is developing readily understood standards for their markets. And the global FX   Committees have published the FX Global Code, the first globally consistent code of conduct for FX markets.                                                                                                                                    3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                  3   During the 18th century, regional banks acted as venture capitalists, providing equity to power the first                            3   industrial revolution. In the mid-19th century, the City underwrote vast issuance of railway securities,                                                                                                                  4   spurring the creation of stock exchanges and the development of modern capital markets.    During the first wave of globalisation in the 19th century, the development of correspondent banking and                                                                       5   trade credit services drove an explosion in global trade, hedged by a step change in activity in the Lloyd�s            6   market.    During the second wave of globalisation in the 20th century, London quickly embraced new information   technologies, becoming the first major centre to adopt electronic trading. The UK�s openness to foreign   currency banking, beginning with the creation of the Eurodollar market, spurred a renaissance of global   capital flows. This financed enormous efficiencies through new global supply chains and unprecedented                                                         7   prosperity by opening up emerging markets.    Throughout the centuries, it�s been clear that private innovation works best when it is grounded in the right   public infrastructure. That includes hard infrastructure � from liquidity facilities to payments architecture �   and soft infrastructure � from the rule of law to up-to-date codes of conduct and effective regulatory   frameworks.    This infrastructure must be overhauled now that the economy is on the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution   and our demographic challenges are intensifying. And rebalancing of the global order is proving as dramatic   as it was in Montagu Norman�s time.    Such profound changes demand a new finance. And a new finance demands a new Bank.    Let me set out how we are responding.       3     Brunt, L (2006), �Rediscovering Risk: Country Banks as Venture Capital Firms in the First Industrial Revolution�, The Journal of   Economic History, Vol. 66, No. 1, pages 74-102.   4     Mokyr, J (2009), �The Enlightened Economy: An Economic History of Britain 1700-1850�, Yale University Press.   5     Hughes, J and MacDonald, S (2002), �International Banking: Text and Cases�, Pearson.   6     Mokyr, J ibid.   7     Schenk, C (1998), �The Origins of the Eurodollar Market in London: 1955 � 1963�, Explorations in Economic History, Vol. 35, Issue 2,   pages 221-38; McGuire, P (2004), �A Shift in London�s Eurodollar market�, BIS Quarterly Review, September 2004; Hughes and   MacDonald (2002) ibid.                                                                                                                                       4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                      4   III. The Drivers of the New Finance    a) The New UK Economy    The economy is reorganising into a series of distributed peer-to-peer connections across powerful networks   � revolutionising how people consume, work and communicate.    The nature of commerce is changing. Sales are increasingly taking place on-line and over platforms, rather                                                                                                            8   than on the high street. Intangible capital is now more important than physical capital. Data is the new oil.    We are entering an age when anyone can produce anything anywhere through 3-D printing, where anyone   can broadcast their performance globally via YouTube or sell to China whatever the size of their business via   Tmall.    In a hyper-connected, capital-light world, the future may increasingly belong to small and medium-sized   firms, with platforms (such as taskrabbit, Amazon, Etsy, Shopify, and SamaHub) giving them direct stakes in   local and global markets.    The financial implications of these developments are only beginning to be realised, but they are likely to be   immense. In anticipation, the Bank is already creating the new hard and soft infrastructure that the new   finance will require.    For example, the Bank of England is in the midst of an ambitious rebuild of the Real Time Gross Settlement   (RTGS) system � the backbone of every payment in the UK.    There are three ways the Bank�s new RTGS will provide a platform for private innovation. Each will make it   easier for people to plug in and pay, even across borders.    First, RTGS is being re-built so that new private payment systems, including those using distributed ledger,   can simply plug into our system. Our new, hard infrastructure will be future-proofed to your imaginations,   opening up a range of potential innovations in wholesale markets, and corporate banking and retail services.    We have just opened up direct access to RTGS to a new generation of non-bank payment service providers   (PSPs). No longer will access to central bank money be the exclusive preserve of banks.    Several non-bank PSPs, focused on retail and corporate services, are applying currently. The electronic   money flowing through their systems will become more like its physical relative. Electronic payments are   becoming instantaneous by using QR codes or mobile phone numbers. Checkout can be eliminated. The   customer, not cash, will reign supreme.    8     In the UK, intangible investment rose above tangible investment in the early 2000s, and stood at 11% as a share of output in 2014   compared with 10% for tangible investment. Investment in intangibles also exceeded that in tangibles in the US, Sweden and Finland   [on average over 1999-2003], but not in other European countries including German, Italy and Spain. See Haskel, J and Westlake, W   (2017), �Capitalism Without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy�, Princeton University Press; and Goodridge, P R, Haskel, J   and Wallis, G (2016), �Accounting for the UK Productivity Puzzle: A Decomposition and Predictions�, Economica, Vol. 85, Issue 339.                                                                                                                                     5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                   5   Second, RTGS is being re-configured to lower the excessive costs of cross-border payments. To this end,                                                     9   two private PSPs joined earlier this year. In parallel, the Bank is working to connect RTGS and the systems   run by other central banks. And we have just begun collaborating with the Bank of Canada, the Monetary   Authority of Singapore and several private-sector firms to improve inter-bank cross-border payments,   including initiatives based on distributed ledger.    The potential returns are large. At present, cross-border payments can cost ten times more than domestic           10   ones.        We estimate that in the UK alone there is scope to realise annual savings of over �600 million. Most   fundamentally, the more seamless are global and domestic payments, the more UK households and   businesses will benefit from the new global economy.    Third, as we overhaul RTGS, the Bank is making it easier for the UK financial system to realise the promise   of big data.    The new RTGS will capture much richer data on every payment made in a format that defines international   best practice. The Bank is currently consulting on how to do this, including on the desirability of embedding   the best corporate identifier, the Legal Entity Identifier (or LEI), in RTGS and all the UK�s main payment                11   systems.          This will improve access to the domestic and global financial system, support greater choice and   competition for corporate end-users, and advance anti-money laundering and combating the financing of   terrorism efforts.    The Bank is also ensuring our rules and regulations � or soft infrastructure � are fit for the new finance.    We have streamlined our approach to authorising banks to make it easier for banks with innovative business   models to be approved. Since 2013, 37 banks have been authorised, of which 16 are new UK bank start-   ups and four are internet-only.    With the FCA we�re are exploring how artificial intelligence and machine learning could be used to make the   reading of our rulebooks easier, the reporting of regulatory data quicker and the analysis of that data more   efficient.    And the Bank is thinking through how regulation may need to change with the investment needs of the new   economy, including new approaches to risk models and secured lending in a world of intangible capital and   data-based finance.       9    In April 2018: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2018/april/non-bank-psp-access-to-the-payments-system-announcement.   10     McKinsey World Payments Map (2016).   11     The G20�s LEI, which originated as a risk management tool for the financial sector, standardises identities for companies.

Over the past quarter century, emerging economies� share of global activity has risen from 40% to 60% and   their share of global trade from one fifth to one third. Yet at present, their financial assets make up only 10%   of the global financial system.    This will quickly change. As emerging market economies continue to open up, their share of global financial   assets could treble to around a third by 2030.    Maintaining the UK�s share of cross-border capital flows during this process could plausibly increase the   balance sheet of our financial sector we host from the current 10 to 15 times GDP by 2030. This will   significantly boost UK prosperity � provided the associated risks of such an open system are managed   responsibly.    Responsible openness rests on three pillars.    The first is strong global standards. The UK has been at the forefront of G20 reforms to create a global   financial system that is safer, simpler and fairer. Implementation is now being regularly assessed and   transparently reported by the FSB and the IMF.    This second pillar is deep supervisory cooperation. To manage cross-border challenges to financial stability,   international authorities must share relevant information and work together. As the home to four, and host to   the other 26, globally systemically important banks, the Bank of England participates actively in all major   supervisory colleges, sharing information and expertise gained from overseeing the multitude of complex   risks unique to London. We expect the same from those whose firms operate and take on large risks here.   The PRA�s open, cooperative approach to supervision means wholesale activity in London can remain                                                                                           12   globally-integrated and highly efficient, without compromising resilience.    The third pillar of responsible openness is ending �too big to fail�. With enhanced resolution powers and   planning, the Bank of England now has the ability to resolve failing banks. The UK�s major banks are on   track to complete this year the ring-fencing of their critical domestic high-street businesses from their riskier   wholesale activities. And they already hold loss absorbing resources of 25% of their risk-weighted assets   against a 2022 requirement of 29%. As a consequence of this progress, market discipline is returning, with   the public subsidy enjoyed by the largest banks having fallen by 90%.    Now is the time to reap the benefits of these enormous efforts. Platforms are being created for deference to   each other�s approaches when they achieve similar outcomes. With the three pillars in place, an open,   resilient global financial system is possible.    12     See the Bank of England�s Policy Statement 3/18, �International banks: the Prudential Regulation Authority�s approach to branch   authorisation and supervision�.                                                                                                                                       7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                     7   The pillars underpin the government�s new Global Financial Partnerships Strategy. The Bank of England will   be particularly engaged in deepening our supervisory cooperation with major emerging economies and will   continue to develop the infrastructure to support cross-border capital flows in their currencies.    With respect to the European Union, the Bank remains of the view that an ambitious future financial services   relationship, founded on commitments to achieving equivalent outcomes and supervisory cooperation,   remains both feasible and in the interests of the UK, Europe and the world.    The future economic and security partnership with the EU is for the government to negotiate and Parliament   to approve. The Bank�s role is to manage risks associated with the Brexit process and to provide technical   support to the government as needed.    In this context, HM Treasury and the Bank are aligned on the importance of maintaining the high regulatory   standards required by the world�s most important and complex international financial centre. And we are   both committed to responsible openness because it allows capital to move freely, efficiently and sustainably   between jurisdictions and that supports trade, investment and jobs in the UK, Europe and the rest of the   world.    More broadly, building on the progress already made, financial services could serve as a template for   broader services trade liberalisation. Taking this high road could help solve the problem of persistent trade   imbalances. Bank of England research suggests that reducing restrictions on services trade, to the same   extent as those on goods have been lowered over the past couple of decades, could reduce excess global   imbalances by close to one half.    Global partnerships also mean taking care of the global commons. In Paris in 2015, 195 global leaders   committed to curbing carbon emissions to limit the rise in global average temperatures to 2 degrees, and   now many governments, including the UK with its new Clean Growth Strategy, are taking the necessary   policy actions.    In response, the private sector is recognising that financing the transition to a low carbon economy will be a   major opportunity. On some estimates, this transition could require investments in infrastructure, equivalent   to $6 trillion per year through to 2030.    Investment on this scale cannot be financed in niche markets. It must be mainstream and global. The City is   showing the way by driving better disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities and leading the   underwriting of green bonds.    The City is showing the way. UK firms, including all of the largest banks, are driving better disclosure of   climate-related financial risks and opportunities. They join global financial institutions responsible for   managing US$80 trillion of assets � equivalent to annual global GDP � that are now publicly supporting the                                                                                                                     8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                               8                                                                         13   G20�s Task Force for Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD).                   And the City is leading the underwriting of local   currency green bonds, where annual issuance could range in the hundreds of billions of dollars.    For its part, the Bank of England has helped catalyse the private sector�s TCFD. We are working closely   with the People�s Bank of China to build domestic and cross-border markets to finance the transition to a low   carbon economy. And we are coordinating with fellow central banks and supervisors representing more than   a third of global output and emissions to develop supervisory approaches to ensure the financial system is fit   for the transition.    c) The New Demographics    As the world is changing it is ageing.    The ratio of the population aged over 65 to those of working age in advanced economies has increased from   15% in 1950 to 30% in 2015, and is projected to rise to 50% over the next twenty years. Over the same   period, this ratio is projected to double to over 25% in emerging markets.    The macroeconomic consequences of these shifts are already evident, with the large, rapidly growing pool of                                                                                            14   retirement savings depressing interest rates and pushing up asset prices.    The need to manage this growing pool of savings will drive further growth in the wealth management,   insurance and pension industries. And it will require new products, for example to meet the unpredictable   costs of long-term care.    In the process, market-based finance, which has already accounted for almost all corporate credit growth   since the crisis, will become even more important.    Seizing the full potential of market-based finance requires the right soft and hard infrastructure for continually   open markets. Hard infrastructure like resilient CCPs. Soft infrastructure like the regulation the liquidity   management of funds that offer daily liquidity while investing in highly illiquid underlying assets.    In particular, it requires hard infrastructure like a robust Bank of England balance sheet that can support the   banking system and the broader system of market-based finance.    The Bank�s new approach can be summarised in four words: we�re open for business. We now provide   liquidity against a wider range of collateral, to a wider range of counterparties, for longer terms, and at lower   fees than ever before. And we stand ready to provide liquidity in a range of foreign currencies if required.       13      The financial sector supporters included 20 globally-systemic banks, 8 of the top 10 global asset managers, the world�s leading   pension funds and insurers, the largest sovereign wealth fund and the two dominant shareholder advisory service companies.   14      See �[De]Globalisation and Inflation�, 2017 IMF Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture given by Mark Carney, and Rachel, L and   Smith, T (2015), �Secular drivers of the global real interest rate�, Bank of England Working Paper No. 571. For a contrary take, see   Goodhart, C and Pradhan, M, (2017), �Demographics will reverse three multi-decade global trends�, BIS Working Papers No. 656.                                                                                                                                    9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                    9   This new approach was tested during the EU referendum. It passed. With hundreds of billions of pounds of   pre-positioned collateral and regular, flexible and widely accessible Bank of England liquidity auctions,                                                                                      15   markets stayed open and price discovery was smooth and effective.    Today marks a step change in our ability to provide the liquidity that the new finance may eventually require.    With the Chancellor�s announcement tonight of a ground-breaking new financial arrangement and capital                                                                                                                      16   injection for the Bank of England, we now have a balance sheet fit for purpose and the future.                          One that   reflects the Bank�s much wider range of responsibilities including banking supervision, macro-prudential   policy and resolution. And the framework enhances our independence, transparency and accountability.    The additional capital will significantly increase the amount of liquidity the Bank can provide through   collateralised, market-wide facilities without needing an indemnity from HM Treasury to more than half a                      17   trillion pounds.        This lending capacity would expand to over three quarters of a trillion pounds when, as   designed, additional capital above the target level is accrued through retained earnings.    The new framework will also strengthen the Bank�s ability to fulfil its monetary stability remit.    In August 2016, the MPC launched the Term Funding Scheme (TFS) in order to reinforce the pass-through   of the cut in Bank Rate to 0.25% to the borrowing rates faced by households and companies. The Bank                                                                                                       18   required an indemnity from HM Treasury for the loans it extended under the TFS.    Today�s announcement increases the amount of risk the Bank can carry on its balance sheet. As a result,   the Bank plans to bring the �127 billion of lending extended through the TFS onto our balance sheet by the   end of 2018/19 the financial year. The additional capital means the MPC could, if necessary, re-launch the   TFS in future on the Bank�s balance sheet, cementing 0% as the lower bound.    Bringing the TFS onto the Bank�s balance sheet next year will mark the first step in winding down the Bank�s   Asset Purchase Facility (APF). After the TFS has been transferred, the APF will fall to �445 billion � the   value of the government and corporate bonds purchased by the MPC as part of its Quantitative Easing   programme.    The MPC updated its guidance today on unwinding its asset purchases. Previously, the Committee had   noted that it would not begin reducing the stock of assets until Bank Rate had reached around 2%. That   reflected the MPC�s preference to use Bank Rate as the primary instrument for monetary policy and its       15      In the run-up to the vote, the Bank undertook extensive contingency planning which included encouraging banks to pre-position   enough collateral in our facilities to enable them to draw down up to �250 billion in liquidity. The combination of this war chest and   coordinated G7 central bank action helped ensure markets functioned normally as the system absorbed a result that had been assigned   a 10% probability hours before. And it meant we could credibly communicate to the public that we were well prepared for the result.   16      See https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/letter/2018/banks-financial-framework-june-2018.   17      The exact amount that can be provided will depend on a range of factors, including the type and amount of collateral, the currency   composition of the lending and the concentration to individual counterparties.   18      See https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/letter/2016/governor-apf-letter-040816.pdf.                                                                                                                                      10     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                      10   desire to have sufficient scope to cut Bank Rate materially � relative to the effective lower bound on Bank                                                                                          19   Rate of 0.5% at that time � if necessary to respond to adverse shocks.    Although the principles guiding the MPC�s choice of threshold still hold, with the lower bound on Bank Rate   now permanently close to 0%, the MPC views that the level from which Bank Rate can be cut materially is   now around 1.5%.    Reflecting this, the MPC now intends not to reduce the stock of purchased assets until Bank Rate reaches   around 1.5%.    Any reductions in the stock of purchased assets will be conducted over a number of years at a gradual and   predictable pace. The MPC continues to view sales and reinvestment decisions as equivalent from a   monetary policy perspective. While any reduction will be solely a decision for the MPC based on meeting its   objectives, the Bank will liaise with the Debt Management Office ahead of implementing any change in its   asset purchase programme.    As asset purchases unwind, decisions on Bank Rate will take into account any impact of changes in the   stock of purchased assets on overall monetary conditions in order to achieve the inflation target. In the event   that potential movements in Bank Rate were judged insufficient to achieve the inflation target, the reduction   in the stock of assets could be amended or reversed.                                                                                                20   The Bank is minded to continue to use a variant of the current floor system                      to control short-term interest   rates as the stock of purchased assets is reduced, with the Bank meeting banks� demand for central bank   reserves in full at Bank Rate.

This gathering rightly echoes the Great Exhibition of 1851. The event at Crystal Palace took place in the                      st   middle of the 1 Industrial Revolution, around the start of the first wave of globalisation. In the Newcastle of   the 1850s, innovation meant the most advanced steam locomotive of the day, the Rocket, and the world�s                                                                                                                       th   first passenger railway, the Stockton to Darlington Railway. Today, on the cusp of the 4 Industrial   Revolution, the businesses of the Northern Powerhouse are connecting through superfast broadband, and   even working to turn the hyperloop from concept to reality.    Then as now, the North looked outwards. During the first wave of globalisation, this region built the ships   that enabled Britain�s economic transformation and its ports were amongst the busiest in the world.    The parallels with the past run deeper still. We meet today after the first decade of falling real incomes in the   UK since the middle of the 19th century, in the wake of a global financial crisis, and in the midst of a   technological revolution that will change the very nature of work. Substitute platforms for textile mills, AI for   the steam engine, and Twitter for the Telegraph and the dynamics echo those of 150 years ago.    A fundamental challenge is that, while technological revolutions ultimately drive great improvements in   prosperity, they first involve painful periods of adjustment. It takes time for new jobs to be created to replace   those made obsolete. It can take more than a generation for new skills to be acquired. And decades can                                                                                                                              1   pass before gains in productivity flow through to the wages of all workers (Charts 1a and 1b).    Of course, the point of recalling the past isn�t to accept it and repeat it, but to learn from it and improve upon   it.    That is why this gathering is rightly focused on how the people and businesses of this region, the country                                                                                                   th   and the world can begin to benefit now from the synergies between the 4 Industrial Revolution and global   commerce.    There are already examples across the North. Sunderland�s automotive companies are at the heart of the   world�s most sophisticated supply chains. Northumberland�s Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult Centre is   at the cutting edge. Durham�s digital bank, Atom, is exploring the latest in machine learning to serve their   customers.    These innovators show it can be done. The challenge is to make such successes the norm at a time of   accelerating change and in a more uncertain global trading environment.     1    The benefits of the first industrial revolution, which began in the early 19th century, were not felt until the second half of the century.

One lesson from the past three Industrial Revolutions is that creating opportunities for all requires                                                                                                          2   fundamental changes to labour market, social welfare and educational institutions.      2       See Carney, M (2018) �The Future of Work�, slides to accompany a presentation at the Public Policy Forum, Toronto, 12 April 2018.                                                                                                                                           3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                         3   For example, in the first two industrial revolutions, universal primary and secondary education became the   norm. By the end of the third, there was a step change in tertiary educational attainment. To keep pace at a   time of immense technological change, the biggest issue may be how to institutionalise mid-career re-   training and to integrate it with a reformed social welfare system. A quaternary system of education, founded   on the same principle of universality but in greater partnership with the private sector, may be required.    I would like to concentrate today on two other enabling institutions � finance and trade � that will be critical to   determining the extent to which the new technologies can bring opportunity for all.    The Second Wave of Globalisation    Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the global trading system has been steadily liberalised (Chart 2), global trade   has grown at an annual rate of 8% and production has become increasingly integrated across borders.

Notes: Imports and GDP are in current US dollars.      Through this process, the effective global labour force has doubled, more than a billion people have been   lifted out of poverty, and living standards have risen dramatically, with output per capita up 40% in both the   UK and globally since the mid-1990s.    At the same time, however, in advanced economies globalisation has become associated with rising   inequality and heightened uncertainty, with many people lamenting a loss of control and losing trust in the   system.    Part of the problem has been that economists and policymakers have not been sufficiently upfront about the   distributional consequences of rapid changes in technology and globalisation. Amongst economists, a belief                                4   in free trade is totemic. But, while trade makes countries better off, it does not raise all boats; in the clinical                                                                               5   words of the economist, trade is not a Pareto improvement.                                                                                                                       6   Rather, the benefits from trade are spread unequally across individuals, regions and time. As result, for   many citizens of advanced economies, measures of the aggregate gains from globalisation bear little relation   to their own experience.                          7   Partly as a result, protectionist sentiment has been rising, prompting the question what could a period of de-   globalisation mean for the economic outlook?    4     For example, see Bhagwati, J. (2011), �Why free trade matters�, Project Syndicate, June 23.   5     In neoclassical models, free trade is Pareto Optimal in principle � in that the aggregate gains are sufficient to compensate those that   lose out while preserving gains for the winners. This typically means some form of redistribution of the gains from trade is needed to   achieve this outcome. This is the Kaldor-Hicks compensation principle. It is an open question, however, whether redistribution of this   kind actually takes place in practice and, indeed, whether it is itself costless, as the Kaldor-Hicks principle assumes.   6     For example, consumers get lower prices and new product varieties, and, over time, benefit from the spur to innovate and higher   productivity. Some workers, however, lose their jobs and the dignity of work, or see their �factor prices� � in plain English, wages �   equalised downwards.                                                                                                                                           5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                         5   Trade in the recent global recovery                                                                                                                                                  8   One of the unsung triumphs of the post-crisis period was the G20�s ability, until now, to resist protectionism.   This admirable restraint helped world goods trade to recover its pre-crisis level two years after the crisis hit,   whereas it languished around 20 percent below its peak during most of the decade after the Great   Depression (Chart 4). When combined with the aggressive response of world�s major central banks, the                                                                                                                         9   continued openness of trade after the crisis helped avoid a repeat of the Great Depression.

With openness maintained and with the shadow of the financial crisis finally receding over the past few   years, global trade began to accelerate, boosting investment and driving a much healthier global recovery   (Chart 5).

But protectionist rhetoric has also risen, and it is now turning into action, with the US increasing tariffs and   the affected countries retaliating.    At the moment, protectionism is largely just talk (and tweets). But what if rhetoric becomes reality?    Some illustrative simulations of the potential trade impact    Protectionism affects the real economy through three channels. There are direct effects, through reduced   trade flows, disrupted supply chains and higher import costs. And there are indirect effects, via business and   consumer confidence and financial conditions.    If implemented, the tariffs announced thus far (between the US and China, the US and EU, and the US and   its NAFTA partners, as well as the potential US tariffs on EU motor vehicles and parts), will broadly double   average bilateral tariff rates (Table 1), and could raise average US tariffs to rates not seen in over 50 years.                                                                                                                          7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                    7   Table 1: Weighted average bilateral tariffs     Tariffs imposed by:                       US                  China            US                 EU   On imports from:                          China               the US           the EU             the US    Existing measures                         2.6                 9.1              3.3                3.0    With announced and                         a                   4.5                 14.9             6.2                7.2   contemplated measures     (a) Announced US tariffs on steel and aluminium, the reciprocated 25% tariff on $50bn of US imports from China, and the potential US   tariffs on EU motor vehicles and parts.    There are some, tentative signs that this more hostile and uncertain trading environment may be dampening   activity. For example, survey measures of global export orders and manufacturing output have fallen back   from highs at the start of this year, and growth in US and euro-area capital goods orders fell to zero in Q1   (Chart 6).

In recent months, global financial conditions have also tightened somewhat though this is likely more to do   with US monetary than trade policy. Nonetheless, there is a growing possibility that trade uncertainty could   crystallise the longstanding risks of a snap back in long-term interest rates, increased risk aversion and a                                                             10   general tightening in global financial conditions.    Bank of England simulations suggest that the impact of narrow, bilateral tariff increases through direct trade   channels would tend to be small � reflecting the small share of overall exports affected � and would be   largely confined to the countries directly involved. However, a larger, increase in tariffs of 10 percentage   points between the US and all of its trading partners could take 2� per cent off US output and 1 per cent off   global output through trade channels alone, although the impact on the UK is smaller reflecting a greater   exchange-rate driven boost to net exports. The hit to global and UK GDP would be substantially greater if   everyone put up tariffs against everyone else (Chart 7a).       10     The economic scenario in the Bank of England�s 2017 stress test of the UK banking system involved an increase in global risk   aversion, which occurred alongside deep, simultaneous recessions in the UK and global economies.

Although the shock from higher tariffs   would drag on activity, their initial impact would be inflationary, particular for the country at the centre of the   trade dispute (Chart 7b).    These simulations consider only direct impacts of tariff increases, and do not include those via business   confidence and financial conditions.    In these regards, the current UK experience with Brexit can provide some insight.   11     Based on simulations using NiGEM. The baseline scenario assumes a 10 percentage point increase in tariffs that persists for three   years. The additional impact from tighter financial conditions is based on 75bp increase in term premia and 50bp increase in equity risk   premia globally; and the uncertainty impact is proxied by assuming agents anticipate a further 10pp increase in tariffs the following   year. Global monetary policy is held fixed for five years.                                                                                                                                        10     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                        10   As we know, the intention of Brexit is not to turn inwards but to broaden openness over time; the strategy is   to step back in order to jump forward. But Brexit will, for a period, be an example of de-globalisation   because any reduction in openness with the EU is unlikely to be immediately compensated by new ties of a   similar magnitude with other trade partners. And even if new agreements with other partners could be struck   instantaneously, the reorientation of business relationships will take some time.    Since the referendum, exporters have been in a sweet spot (Chart 8), benefiting from the lower level of   sterling in anticipation of a Brexit that has not yet happened.    Confidence effects have been more material. Forward-looking business investment has been on the side                                                                                                                                  12   lines, as Brexit-related uncertainties have outweighed otherwise very favourable conditions (Chart 9).   While households looked through Brexit-related uncertainties initially, they cut back on spending as the   consequences of sterling�s fall showed up in the shops and squeezed their real incomes. Consumer   confidence remains well below its pre-referendum levels (Chart 10).

I would also like to thank Will Abel, Andy Haldane, Carsten Jung, Rana Sajedi and Greg Thwaites for   the background research and analysis they conducted.                                                                                                           1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches   It is a pleasure to deliver this lecture in honour of TK Whitaker.    Whitaker�s career in public policy spanned a period of profound structural change in the Irish economy. In   1956, when he became Secretary of the Department for Finance, the Irish economy was isolated and   uncompetitive. Growth in output per capita was lagging the rest of Europe and the steady tide of emigration   was gradually shrinking the population. By the time Whitaker�s career drew to a close, the Celtic Tiger was   roaring: Ireland had caught up with even the most prosperous nations in the EU, GDP growth was averaging   over 5%, and the population had increased by two-thirds as emigration switched to immigration.    The catalyst for this transformation was opening up to foreign trade and investment. Beginning with the 1958   report Economic Development, Whitaker strongly advocated replacing the old strategy of self-sufficiency with   a new one of export-led growth, which led in time to Ireland joining the EU. For many, this is the greatest   long-term consequence of his work.    But as students of economic history know (and policymakers learn at their cost), without the right institutions,   structural changes � whether large changes to trading relationships or technological revolutions � can be   painful.    Whitaker recognised that �Readiness to adapt to changing conditions is a sine qua non for economic              1   success� and that adaptability required a series of changes to Ireland�s institutions. Major reforms to   education were essential to match the skills of the Irish workforce to the potential jobs that increased inward   investment could bring. A 1964 report on Manpower Policy, which Whitaker oversaw as chair, advocated                                                                                                                2   greater investment in the STEM subjects, readying a generation for the IT revolution. More broadly, Ireland   repeatedly increased standards of education, beginning with the introduction of universal secondary                                                                                                                                     3   schooling in 1967, resulting in levels of educational attainment today that exceed the OECD average.    Whitaker also advocated reforms of labour market institutions � to tackle restrictive work practices and                                                                    4   ensure pay was more closely linked to productivity.    Emphasis was also placed on a competitive environment for business to help attract foreign capital, in part   through the overhaul of the corporate tax regime. And improvements were made to infrastructure, such as   power supplies and transport services.      1     Taken from �Economic Development�, a report on the Irish Economy overseen by Whitaker and published in 1958.   2     Whitaker played a central role in improving education in the public sector. His concern �that the variety and difficulty of administrative   problems have so increased, and the tools and techniques for solving them have so developed, as to render administration more than   ever a science� resulted in the creation of the Institute of Public Administration in 1957. To this day, the Institute continues to provide   education, training and research to the public sector, enabling better policy making through a better understanding of the Irish economy.   In addition, Whitaker was instrumental in setting up the Economic and Social Research Institute � the first institution to provide   independent research and analysis of the Irish economy.   3     For example, nine Regional Technical Colleges were established during the 1970s to provide vocational tertiary level training. The   Industrial Development Authority ensured that government funding of higher education adapted to meet businesses� increasing   demands for skilled labour in areas such as engineering and computer sciences, helping to ensure people could develop the skills   necessary to work in the expanding sectors.   4     Whitaker, TK (1955/1956) 'Capital formation, saving and economic progress', Dublin: Journal of the Statistical and Social Inquiry   Society of Ireland, Vol. XVIX, pp. 184-209.                                                                                                                                            2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                            2   The Irish experience over the past half century reinforces the lessons learnt in the UK from the three   profound technological revolutions � institutions are essential to smooth the major transitions and to ensure   their promise is realised by as many as possible.    Getting institutions right is critical not just for core economic outcomes but for broader well-being.    The fundamental challenge is that alongside the great benefits they ultimately bring, every technological   revolution mercilessly destroys jobs and livelihoods � and therefore identities � well before the new ones   emerge.    This was true of the eclipse of agriculture and cottage industry by the industrial revolution, the development                                                                                                       5   of the production line, the displacement of manufacturing by the service economy.    We are on the cusp of a Fourth Industrial Revolution, which has the potential to transform fundamentally the   nature of both work and commerce through advances in AI, automation and interconnectedness.    Our economies are reorganising into a series of distributed peer-to-peer connections across powerful   networks � revolutionising how people consume, work and communicate. The nature of commerce is   changing. Sales are increasingly taking place online and over platforms, rather than on the high street.                                                                              6   Intangible capital is now more important than physical capital. We are entering an age when anyone will be   able to produce anything anywhere through 3-D printing, where anyone can broadcast their performance   globally via YouTube or sell to China whatever the size of their business via Tmall.    Today, I want to discuss how we can apply the lessons from the history of the first three industrial revolutions   to the fourth to secure a future that benefits all.    Crisis? What Crisis?    Some economists wonder what all the fuss is about. They argue that there has been little evidence, over the   long term, of technological unemployment. After all, average employment and unemployment rates today                                     th   are similar to those in the 18 century.       5     The First Industrial Revolution (1760 � 1840) saw the mechanisation of (mainly the textile) industry with the introduction of steam   power, moving people from home-based to factory-based production in urban areas. The Second Industrial Revolution (1860 � 1914)   was driven by the introduction of electricity to manufacturing, extending mechanised, assembly-line mass production to broader   industries. The Third Industrial Revolution (1970 � 2000) was defined by the move from mechanical/analogue to digital, with wide-   spread adoption of electronics from both the home and work environment. The Fourth Industrial Revolution (2000 � current) anticipates   the dawn of true Artificial Intelligence in light of advances in robotics, nanotechnology and quantum computing.   6     In the UK, intangible investment rose above tangible investment in the early 2000s, and stood at 11% as a share of output in 2014   compared with 10% for tangible investment. Investment in intangibles also exceeded that in tangibles in the US, Sweden and Finland   [on average over 1999-2003], but not in other European countries including German, Italy and Spain.

Workers generally cannot move seamlessly to new jobs in which they can                                                                                                                                th   be productive. The benefits of the First Industrial Revolution, which began in the latter half of the 18                                                                                                            th 7   century, were not felt fully in productivity and wages until the second half of the 19 .                                       th   Indeed, at the start of the 19 century in the UK, despite a sharp pickup in productivity, wage growth stalled   and the labour share fell � a period dubbed �Engels� pause�.    A Framework for Examining Technical Change and the Labour Market                                                                                                         8   To understand such dynamics it helps to have a common conceptual framework. The impact of   technological change on employment and wages can be depicted as the sum of three major effects:   destruction, productivity and creation.    The destruction effect is the focus of most alarmist accounts: the replacement of labour by technology, with   an associated reduction in labour demand, wages and employment.    Less commonly acknowledged are the positive effects on aggregate demand of new technologies, what can   be termed the productivity effect.    This effect is analogous to the classic Say�s law in which supply creates its own demand. Technology makes   those in work more productive, in time boosting wages and increasing the returns to those who own capital.   This greater income boosts aggregate demand and leans against the destruction effect.    When technological change is disruptive and widespread, the productivity effect is generally insufficient to   counteract completely the destruction effect, partly because of the time it takes for the full potential of new   technologies to be realised, and partly because of the phenomenon of greater job polarisation � to which I   will turn to in a moment.    As a consequence, over the medium term, technological change tends to reduce labour�s share of income.    Historically, however, technological progress has not led to permanent declines in the labour share because                                                                     9   of a third effect � the creation of new tasks for labour. When combined with the productivity effect, this   ultimately has counterbalanced the displacement effects of technology, boosting productivity and wages   while leaving employment unaffected.       7     Partly there is a lag in reorganising enough of the economy to the advantage of the new general purpose technology for aggregate   productivity growth to increase.   8     The following is based on Acemoglu, D and Restrepo, P (2018), �Artificial Intelligence, Automation and Work�, NBER Working Paper   No. 24196.   9     This creation effect need not be fully exogenous to the technological change, for example because the new technologies allow new   jobs to emerge that wouldn�t otherwise be possible � though of course factors like education and skills are important in determining how   quickly and smoothly these gains come about.                                                                                                                                        4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                        4   Could this time be different?    The Fourth Industrial Revolution could differ from its three predecessors in terms of scope, scale and speed.    Scope    Thus far, each wave of technological change has increased the importance of cognitive tasks relative to non-   cognitive ones. In other words, machines have largely substituted for human hands not heads. Workers   have been able to improve their skills and take on newly created sets of cognitive, higher value tasks � tasks   beyond the cognitive limits of machines.    Rapid improvements in computing power, the increased availability of big data and advances in artificial   intelligence and machine learning mean smarter machines are already replacing a broader range of human   activities than before, reaching well into the range of �heads�. New technologies may increasingly provide   intelligence, sensory perception, and reasoning which previously only labour could provide. Technological               10   optimists        believe future automation will move beyond substituting for the �routine-manual� human tasks                                                th                                                          11   technology performed in the late 20 century to almost the entire spectrum of work.    It may be left to people to provide �hearts� � that is, tasks that require emotional intelligence, originality or   social skills such as persuasion or caring for others. And if new forms of bespoke mass creativity are made   possible by the new global economy, human �hands� may once again take over (a form of cottage industry                         12   going full circle).        One thing that could be different is the effects of demographics. An ageing population                                                                                                    13   will lead to greater demand for care and a straight decrease in labour supply.    Scale    The greater scope of the Fourth Industrial Revolution could mean its scale is larger too. Unlike in previous                                                                                                                              14   episodes, the jobs most at risk of automation are likely to lie across the entire spectrum of wages.                                                         15                                                                            16   At one extreme, Frey and Osborne (2017)                   estimate that around half of US employment is at �high risk� of   automation, over an unspecified period of time.       10      For example, Brynjolfsson, E and McAfee, A (2014), �The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant   Technologies�. The most extreme view of this is put forward by Daniel Susskind, who highlights the possibility that in the future   machines can perform all tasks leading to technological unemployment (Susskind, D (2017), �A model of technological unemployment�,   University of Oxford, Department of Economics Series Working Papers, No. 819).   11      The question at the heart of this debate is whether we can overcome �Polanyi�s Paradox� - that �we can know more than we can tell�   (Polanyi 1966). Our inability to detail these tasks (such as social interactions) in a formulaic manner currently makes them difficult to   encode and automate.   12      McKinsey (2017) also suggest demand for creative and social skills will increase.   13      I am grateful to my colleague Silvana Tenreyro for suggesting this point.   14      Brynjolfsson, E, Mitchell, T and Rock,D (2018), �What Can Machines Learn and What Does It Mean for Occupations and the   Economy�, AEA Papers and Proceedings, Vol. 108, pp. 43-47.   15      Frey, C B and Osborne, M (2017), �The future of employment: How susceptible are jobs to computerisation?�, Technological   Forecasting and Social Change, Vol. 114, pp. 254-280.   16      Defined as roles with over 70% chance of automation.                                                                                                                                           5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                         5   However, this estimate does not take into account the heterogeneity of tasks within jobs, focusing instead on   just the key tasks within each occupation. Each job usually has some components which cannot be   automated, even if many of its central components can be.    Indeed, evidence increasingly suggests that while large parts of many jobs will be subject to automation,                                                                     17                                            18   relatively few jobs will be completely automated.                      Felten, Raj and Seamans (2017)                show that recent   advances in technology can be used to predict future changes in the task structure of occupations, lending   further support to the argument that technological advancement will likely change the nature of many jobs   rather than eliminate them completely.    The more extreme estimates are often based purely on technical feasibility of automation with limited   consideration of economic feasibility. For example, it may be possible to automate the pouring of drinks in   bars, but doing so may not present a cost saving over hiring bar staff to do the job let alone the ancillary   benefit of being able to tell them your troubles.    Taking these additional considerations into account reduces the share of jobs at high risk of automation to                                                            19   some 10% in the UK and 15% in Ireland.                        That appears comparable with the three previous episodes of   technological revolution, which saw the share of aggregate employment accounted for by the most exposed   industries fall by between 10 to 20% over long periods.    Some argue that the greater scope and scale of tasks (as opposed to jobs) at risk of replacement by   technology means that new job creation might no longer increase overall employment. That is, the   destruction effect may outweigh the combined impact of the productivity and creation effects.    At the same time, the range of tasks at risk could substantially increase the impact on inequality for several   reasons. Most fundamentally, the more new technology substitutes for labour rather than complements it,   the more the gains would accrue to capital rather than labour. An unequal distribution of capital means that   increasing automation will push up inequality by construction. In the transition, what economists                                                                                                                                             20   euphemistically call frictions can lead to depressed local or national labour markets, boosting inequality.    And if education is unable to keep pace with the changing demand for skills, those who already have the                                                                                      21   skills to use new technologies will earn even higher premiums.                          Job polarisation will increase the supply of                                                       22   labour competing for lower skilled jobs.                  Greater global interconnectedness will reinforce these dynamics.       17      For example, McKinsey Global Institute (2017), �A Future that Works: Automation, Employment and Productivity� suggest that 60% of   occupations could see over 30% of their tasks replaced by technology, based on O*NET analysis.   18      Felten, E W, Raj, M and Seamans, R (2018), �A Method to Link Advances in Artificial Intelligence to Occupational Abilities, AEA   Papers and Proceedings, Vol. 108, pp. 54-57.   19      Nedelkoska, L and Quintini, G (2018), �Automation, skills use and training�, OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers   No. 202. Similarly, McKinsey argue that across advanced economies 15% of the workforce in total will need to shift occupational   categories because of digitisation, automation, and AI.   20      This process has been well documented for the China Shock in the US (Autor, Dorn and Hanson 2015) and the collapse of local   housing markets (Mian and Sufi 2015).   21      If those who understand technology less well are less willing to trust it and work with it, this could further increase its polarising effects.                                                                                                                                                  6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                                  6   Speed    Could the Fourth Industrial Revolution happen faster? Certainly, the time taken for new technologies to be   adopted has shortened dramatically since the dawn of the First Industrial Revolution.    The Story Thus Far    Current empirical work suggests on balance that, thus far, increased automation has been positive for   employment in aggregate even though it has led to substantial compositional changes. Importantly, while   technology has reduced middle-skilled employment, its effects on aggregate employment appear to have   been more than offset by increased product demand and local demand spillovers. After all, the employment   share in the UK is near all-time highs.    There are, however, signs that recent technological advances have increased inequality. Globally, labour   has seen its share of income fall over the past twenty years and the IMF (2017) finds that technological                              rd   progress during the 3 Industrial Revolution has been the biggest contributor to this decline. The UK and             23   Ireland        are outliers: in both countries, the labour share has been flat, and income inequality stable � if high                                24   � since the late 1980s.    Moreover, there is strong evidence that advanced economy labour markets have been polarising since the   1980s � a structural shift that have generally been attributed to technological displacement of mid-skilled jobs   resulting from the early stages of automation and digitisation of tasks. Employment growth has been   strongest at the high and low skilled ends of the jobs spectrum, resulting in a hollowing out of mid-skilled   employment. The polarisation of the labour market has also been evident in the returns to skilled labour,   with earnings growth for those with higher levels of education far outstripping those with less schooling.    So in summary thus far, if the Fourth Industrial Revolution is similar to past technological revolutions, the   overall effect will eventually be labour augmenting � boosting productivity and wages, while creating new   jobs to maintain or even increase overall employment.    But that is in the long run. In the interim, if it is similar to previous industrial revolutions, it seems likely there   will be a period of technological unemployment, dislocation and rising inequality.    Given that it could happen more rapidly, the challenge of workforce adjustment could be more difficult. The   shifts required in employment from jobs involving heads to those with hearts and hands could be far greater   each year than seen in previous episodes. Moreover, unlike in the previous industrial revolutions, the more   rapid pace of adjustment and longer working lives means workers may not have the option of retiring. This   22      Analysis by the IMF indicates that the extent of job polarisation depends far more on the ease of substitution between labour and   technology than it does on the relative price of technology.   23      Calculating the labour share using gross national income and removing distortions that stem from how multinational corporations   account for their global operations by excluding retained earnings of firms that have re-domiciled to Ireland, the depreciation of foreign-   owned intellectual property assets located in Ireland, and the depreciation of aircraft owned by aircraft-leasing companies.   24      The low level of automation in the UK � which Hal Varian has suggested could be linked to the size of the automobile and electronics   sectors � may be one reason why the UK labour share has remained resilient.                                                                                                                                           7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                           7   raises risks of substantial skills mismatch, leading to increased structural unemployment and adverse   macroeconomic outcomes.    What could we do to shorten the lags? What does history teach us about building Whitaker�s adaptability   today?    Institutions to Cushion the Blow and Speed the Transformation    In past industrial revolutions, the actions of public, private and third party institutions have helped shrink the   duration, impact and cost of the transition. It is worth reflecting on these interventions as we think about how                                                                                 25   to manage the transition to the Fourth Industrial Revolution.    The skills bases of workers were fundamentally transformed by a series of reforms to enabling institutions                                                                       26   including primary, secondary and tertiary education.                     New insurance institutions were created to support                                                                                                                                27   those left behind in the transition, including unemployment insurance and universal health care.                                  And   labour market institutions � cooperatives, trades unions, and the introduction of a minimum wage and private                                                                   28,29   company pensions � plugged gaps in provisions.    Throughout these periods, many employers helped create an environment in which employees could thrive.   From charitable support in the First Industrial Revolution; to the Ford era of self-interested paternalism in   between, and the GooglePlex, self-contained communities of today, business has shaped the welfare of   many.       25      My colleague Andy Haldane has also discussed these issues. See �Ideas and Institutions � A Growth Story�, speech given at The   Guild Society, Oxford, 23 May 2018.   26      In the UK in the late 18th and early 19th century, a mix of public, private and religious institutions � largely driven by charitable motives   � brought education to children working in mills. In the second and third revolutions, the state established formal primary, secondary   and tertiary education.   27      For example, in the First Industrial Revolution, with no welfare state and only the (dire) prospect of a Victorian workhouse, employees   set up Friendly Societies and Co-operatives to support colleagues falling on hard times. With trade unions outlawed until the end of the   period, it fell to the will of charitable industrialists, the likes of Robert Owen and Sir Titus Salt to improve conditions inside mills.   By the end of the Second Industrial Revolution, spurred by a more organised labour force, the Government provided welfare for its   population through workplace injury compensations, basic pensions and unemployment provisions. The interwar years ushered in   universal healthcare, unemployment insurance and pensions.   By the dawn of the 3rd Revolution, individual enterprise and privatisation were ascendant. Reform of social services � to help create a   society of equal opportunity � followed, supported by increased public spending for maternity and child benefits, early years education,   and provisions for pensioners.   28      The number of Friendly Societies rose to 27,000 by the end of the 1800s and Trade Union membership quadrupled from 2 million in   1889 to 8.3 million by 1920. Spurred by industrial unrest, the state introduced the precursor to the minimum wage in the first decade of   the 1900s. Unionism has been in decline since the 1970s, with membership dipping below six million in 2012 for the first time since the   1940s.   29      Recent work indicates that trade unions in the US played an important role in supporting the wages of lower-skilled workers during the   years of the 3rd Industrial Revolution, thereby helping to limit increases in inequality over this period. See Farber, H S , Herbst, D,   Kuziemko, I and Naidu, S (2018), �Unions and Inequality over the Twentieth Century: New Evidence from Survey Data�, NBER Working   Paper No. 24587.                                                                                                                                               8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                                8   So building on the past, what could be done this time?    First, everyone can contribute to a better understanding of the new skills that will be required. That includes   granular reviews by firms of the mismatches between their current talent pool and future needs; estimates   by the creators of general purpose technologies of the breadth of their potential applications; and reporting   by public institutions on the aggregate pace of automation and trends in the labour market.    The rate-limiting factor of technology adoption is often the skill-set of existing employees. For that reason   alone, business has an enormous interest in effective workforce training. And the providers of general-   purpose technologies have a responsibility to explore how they can develop their products in ways that   maximise job-creation or broader social benefits. For example, DeepMind established an Ethics and Society   Research Unit to help technologists put ethics into practice, and to help society anticipate and direct the   impact of AI so that it works for the many.    New labour market institutions will need to balance facilitating labour mobility and encouraging appropriate   protections of workers in non-standard forms of employment that emerge in industries, as considered in the                                                                      30   UK by the Taylor review of modern working practices.    Other issues range from technology solutions to improve matching to news frameworks data portability   (including reputational histories).    Each industrial revolution has eventually been accompanied by major innovations in enabling or educational   institutions.    The biggest issue may be how to institutionalise re-training in mid-career and to integrate it with the social   welfare system.    The time for a quaternary system of education, founded on the same principle of universality as primary,   secondary and tertiary education may eventually arrive.                                                                                                              31   There are also roles for retraining schemes, such as the UK�s Flexible Learning Fund                           and the Singapore   SkillsFuture programme, which offers all its citizens aged 25 and over �250 credit to pay for approved work-   skills related courses. Generous subsidies, of up to 90% for Singaporeans aged 40 and over, are available   on top of this credit. According to SkillsFuture�s Chief Executive, the returns on t"

INTRO    Last week, global financial policymakers gathered in Bali for the Annual Meetings of the IMF and World   Bank.    These meetings came a decade after the global financial crisis, two decades after the Asian crisis, and three   decades after the Latin American debt crisis. Anyone spot a pattern?    Despite the past decade of financial reform, many are asking whether anything has really changed.    I am going to argue today that such weary fatalism is at odds with reality. That the radical programme of   G20 reforms has made the global financial system safer, simpler and fairer. That these measures are   creating a system that can serve households and businesses in bad times as well as good. That true   change is creating true finance, a system that can deepen financial inclusion, better meet the needs of   ageing populations and help fund the transition to a low carbon economy.    But I will also caution that we will forfeit these gains if we once again fall under the spell of the three lies of   finance that helped cause the global financial crisis. To resist their siren calls, we must maintain the new   institutional frameworks created in its wake.    Globally, the most important of these is the Financial Stability Board (FSB). Having agreed all the major   international reforms to address the causes of the crisis, the FSB is now pivoting to focus on their timely,   effective and consistent implementation. Mindful of history, the FSB is also scanning the horizon to identify   and address new vulnerabilities that emerge as the structure of our economies and financial systems   change.    We know we cannot rest on our laurels. Financial history rhymes all too frequently, with enormous costs to   our citizens. We must remain vigilant, resist the three lies of finance, and reinforce some core financial   truths.    II. THE THREE LIES OF FINANCE                                                          �This Time Is Different�    The first lie of finance is the four most expensive words in the English language: �This Time Is Different.�1    This misconception is usually the product of an initial success, with early progress gradually building into a   blind faith in a new era of effortless prosperity.    It took a revolution in macroeconomic policy to help win the battles against the high and unstable inflation,   rising unemployment and volatile growth of the 1970s and 1980s.    1    For an extensive survey, see Reinhart, C and Rogoff, R, (2009), This time is different: eight centuries of financial folly, Princeton   University Press.                                                                                                                                            2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                          2   Stagflationary threats were tamed by new regimes for monetary stability that were both democratically   accountable and highly effective.    Clear remits. Parliamentary accountability. Sound governance. Independent, transparent and effective   policy-making. These were the great successes of that time and their value endures today.    But these innovations did not deliver lasting macroeconomic stability. Far from it.    Price stability was no guarantee of financial stability. An initially healthy focus would become a dangerous   distraction. Against the serene backdrop of the so-called Great Moderation (Chart 1), a storm was brewing   as total non-financial debt in the G7 rose by the size of its GDP (Chart 2).    Several factors drove this debt super-cycle including demographics and the stagnation of middle-class real   wages (itself the product of technology and globalisation). In the US, households had to borrow to increase   consumption. �Let them eat cake� became �let them eat credit�.2    Financial innovation made it easier to do so. And the ready supply of foreign capital made it cheaper.    Most importantly � and this is the lie � complacency among individuals and institutions, fed by a long period   of macroeconomic stability and rising asset prices, made this remorseless borrowing seem sensible.3    When the crisis broke, policymakers quickly dropped the received wisdoms of the Great Moderation and   scrambled to re-learn the lessons of the Great Depression.4 Minsky became mainstream.5                                                    Lie II: �Markets Always Clear�    A deep-seated faith in markets lay beneath the new era thinking of the Great Moderation. Captured by the   myth that finance can regulate and correct itself spontaneously, authorities retreated from their regulatory   and supervisory responsibilities.6    The second lie, the belief that �markets always clear,� has two dangerous consequences.7    First, if markets always clear, they can be assumed to be in equilibrium� or said differently �to be always   right�. If markets are efficient, then bubbles can neither be identified nor can their potential causes be       2      Raghuram Rajan (2010), �Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy�.   3      This emphasis on the endogenous tendency of financial systems to become unstable is reminiscent of Hyman Minsky�s �financial   instability hypothesis� (Minsky (1992)).   4      See for example, Krugman, P, (1999, updated and reissued 2008), The Return of Depression Economics and the crisis of 2008,   Penguin.   5      Indeed, in a July 2016 article, The Economist noted that Minksy had been referred to only once in their publication during his working   life from the 1950s through to 1996 when he died, but that he had been mentioned around 30 times since the crisis broke in 2007.   6      For a review of this broader phenomenon, see Padoa-Schioppa, T (2010), �Markets and government before, during and after the 2007-   20xx crisis�, The Per Jacobsson Lecture, June.   7      See also Turner, A (2010), �Market efficiency and rationality: why financial markets are different�, Lionel Robbins Memorial Lectures,   London School of Economics.                                                                                                                                        3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                         3   addressed. Such thinking dominated the practical indifference to the housing and credit booms before the   crisis.8    Second, if markets always clear, they should possess a natural stability. Evidence to the contrary must be   the product of either market distortions or incomplete markets.    Much of financial innovation springs from the logic that the solution to market failures is to build new markets   on old ones.9 Progress through infinite regress.    During the Great Moderation, this view became an organising principle for financiers and policymakers. The   latter pursued a light touch regulatory agenda in quest for a perfect real world of complete markets first   described as abstract theory by Arrow and Debreu.10    Of course, markets only clear in textbooks. In reality, people are irrational, economies are imperfect, and   nature itself is unknowable.    When such imperfections exist, adding markets can sometimes make things worse.    Take synthetic credit derivatives, which were supposed to complete a market in default risk and thereby   improve the pricing and allocation of capital.    Financial alchemy appeared to have distributed risk, parcelling it up and allocating it to those who wanted   most to bear it.11    However, the pre-crisis system had only spread risk, contingently and opaquely, in ways that ended up   increasing it. Once the crisis began, risk quickly concentrated on the balance sheets of intermediaries that   were themselves capital constrained. And with the fates of borrowers and lenders tied together via hyper-   globalised banks and markets, problems at the core spread violently to the periphery.    A truth of finance is that the riskiness of an asset depends on who owns it. When markets don�t clear,   agents may be surprised to find what they own and for how long. When those surprises are � or are thought   to be � widespread, panic ensues (Chart 3).     8     Such na�vet� is striking given that evidence of disequilibria abounds in markets for goods and labour. In goods markets, there is   �sluggishness everywhere�. Left to themselves, economies can go for sustained periods operating above or below potential, resulting,   ultimately, in excessive or deficient inflation. Yet efficient market forces �should� bring about changes in prices sufficient to equate   demand with potential, leaving inflation as a purely monetary phenomenon. In labour markets, there is �rigidity everywhere�. Rather than   fluidly adjusting to equate the demand for labour with its supply, periods of deficient labour demand can persist, sustaining mass   unemployment and joblessness. Yet efficient market forces �should� eliminate these disequilibria by having wages adjust to ensure full   employment always and forever. Monetary Policy is not only a response to these rigidities; it is made effective by them.   9     But economists of a more nuanced persuasion pointed out as far back as the 1950s that this logic is flawed. See Lipsey, R and   Lancaster, K (1956), �The general theory of the second best�, Review of Economic Studies, 24(1).   10      Their world imagines self-interested, atomistic agents, coolly calculating odds over all future possible states of the world, writing and   trading contracts with each other, all frictionlessly enforced, all achieving mutually beneficial � indeed socially optimal � outcomes.   Arrow, K and Debreu, (1954), �Existence of an equilibrium for a competitive economy�, Econometrica, 22 (3).   11      The bankers who played a leading role in developing the credit derivatives market declared �Credit derivatives are a mechanism for   transferring risk efficiently around the system� and that defaulted loans that would have knocked a hole in a bank�s balance sheet ten   years ago were �now hits that we have spread around the system, and represent tiny blips on the balance sheet of hundreds of financial   institutions�, see p99, Tett, G., �Fool�s Gold�, (2009).                                                                                                                                            4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                            4   The impossibility of completing markets was not the only practical problem with the pre-crisis approach.   Even if markets could be perfected, nature itself is unknowable.12    That is genuine uncertainty, as opposed to risk, the distinction made by Frank Knight in the 1920s.13 And it   means that market outcomes reflect individual choices made under a pretence of knowledge.14    The swings in sentiment that result � pessimism one moment, exuberance the next � do not reflect nature�s   odds, but our own assessments of them, inevitably distorted by Keynes� optimistic �animal spirits� and his   cynical �beauty contests�.15    These are dynamics that can afflict not just sophisticated investors, but mortgage lenders and homebuyers,   especially during a �new era�.    If house prices can only go up, it is possible to borrow large multiples and pay off future obligations with the   capital gains that will follow.    Such �rational� behaviour fuelled the credit binge that ultimately led to the global crisis.    In the end, belief that �markets are always right� meant that policymakers didn�t play their proper roles   moderating those tendencies in pursuit of the collective good.                                                      Lie III: �Markets Are Moral�    The third lie, that markets are always moral, takes for granted the social capital that markets need to fulfil   their promise.16    The crisis showed that if left unattended, markets can be prone to excess and abuse.    In financial markets, means and ends can be conflated too easily. Value can become abstract and relative.   And the pull of the crowd can overwhelm the integrity of the individual.    Consider the example of fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) markets, which have historically   relied heavily on informal codes and understandings.17     12      Recall that the Arrow-Debreu world relies on people being able to calculate the odds of each and every possible scenario. Then they   can trade contracts and insure each other against risks they are unwilling to bear. Even a moment of introspection reveals the absurdity   of these assumptions as a description of the actual world. More often than not, even describing the universe of possible outcomes is   beyond the means of mere mortals, let alone ascribing subjective probabilities to those outcomes.   13      Knight, F (1921), Risk, uncertainty and profit, Signalman Publishing.   14      FA Hayek Nobel prize speech 1974 �The pretence of knowledge�.   15      In Keynes (1936), Chapter 12, he wrote: �Even apart from the instability due to speculation, there is the instability due to the   characteristic of human nature that a large proportion of our positive activities depend on spontaneous optimism rather than on a   mathematical expectation, whether moral or hedonistic or economic. Most, probably, of our decisions to do something positive, the full   consequences of which will be drawn out over many days to come, can only be taken as a result of animal spirits � of a spontaneous   urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative   probabilities.� Keynes, J M (1936), The General Theory of Interest, Employment and Money, Palgrave Macmillan.   16      Carney (2014), Inclusive capitalism: creating a sense of the systemic.   17      They have also, over the centuries, been beset by poor behaviour, as shown by the FMSB�s comprehensive review of misconduct   over the past two centuries. The history of financial fraud has rhymed all too frequently. See FMSB Annual Report (2017).                                                                                                                                       5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                        5   Repeated episodes of misconduct � such as the Libor and FX scandals � called into question the social   licence that markets need to innovate and grow.18    Rather than being professional and open, markets became informal and clubby. Rather than competing on   merit, participants colluded online. Rather than everyone taking responsibility for their actions, few were held   to account.    The crisis reminded us that real markets don�t just happen; they depend on the quality of market   infrastructure for their effectiveness, resilience and fairness.    Robust market infrastructure is a public good in constant danger of under-provision, not least because the   best markets innovate continually. This risk can only be overcome if all market actors, public and private,   recognise their responsibilities for the system as a whole.    III. TRUE FINANCE    So this time is no different. Markets don�t always clear. And we can suffer from their amorality.    What to do with such knowledge? And how to retain it?    To resist the siren calls of the three lies of finance, policymakers and market participants must bind   themselves to the mast. That means building institutional frameworks that make it easier to resist as the lies   regain their seductive power. If we can, we will build True Finance, an enduring platform for strong,   sustainable and balanced growth.    Over the past decade, great strides have been made.    Let me begin with the global reforms that have addressed the third lie that �markets are moral�.    In the cycle of scandal, response, integrity, drift, and new scandal, potential solutions have oscillated   between the extremes of Light Touch Regulation and Total Regulation.    There are problems with each.    By undervaluing the importance of hard and soft infrastructure to the functioning of real markets, light touch   regulation led directly to the financial crisis.19       18      The scale of misconduct impaired banks� ability to function fairly and effectively. Global banks� misconduct costs have exceeded $320   billion, capital that could otherwise have supported around $5 trillion of lending to households and businesses. More worrying still, in a   system where trust is fundamental, it ought to be of grave concern that only 20% of UK citizens now think that banks are well run,   compared to 90% in the 1980s.    19      �Hard infrastructure� refers to the way in which markets are organised. �Soft infrastructure� refers to the standards and norms,   including regulation, market standards and codes, by which markets operate.                                                                                                                                         6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                          6   Market standards were poorly understood, often ignored and always lacked teeth. Too many participants   neither felt responsible for the system nor recognised the full impact of their actions. Bad behaviour went   unchecked, proliferated and eventually became the norm.    Yet a system reliant on total regulation and large ex post sanctions is similarly bound to fail because it   promotes a culture of complying with the letter of the law, not its spirit, and because authorities will inevitably   lag developments in fast-changing markets.    A more comprehensive and lasting solution combines public regulation with private standards and then   buttresses both with incentives to increase materially the understanding and accountability of individuals.    In the UK, new laws and regulations are doing just that.20 Compensation rules now align risk and reward,   with a significant proportion of variable compensation deferred for up to seven years across the banking   industry. Regulatory references mean that the histories of those with a record of misconduct will be known to   anyone considering hiring them.21    Authorities have also used their convening powers to encourage market participants to develop standards of   market practice, such as the new Global FX Code and the FMSB standards for FICC markets.22 23    The UK Senior Managers' Regime (SMR) gives teeth to voluntary codes by incentivising firms to embed   them and by re-establishing the link between seniority and accountability.24 Under the SMR, the most senior   decision-makers of banks, insurers and major investment firms can now be held individually accountable if   they fail to take reasonable steps (including training or proper oversight) to prevent regulatory breaches in   their areas of responsibility.    The FSB has identified a similar menu of tools under its Misconduct Action Plan, which its members can   draw from. Thus far, however, action to promote good conduct has varied widely across the G20.25    The FSB�s compensation standards have been written into G20 regulatory rules, but not yet fully deployed.26   Although adjusting in-year pay is common, clawing back bonuses later on is not, even though it typically   takes several years for evidence of misconduct to emerge. And few jurisdictions have put in place either   formal mechanisms to ensure that boards and senior managers are explicitly responsible and accountable   for what happens at their regulated firms or regulatory references to stop those with poor conduct records   moving from firm to firm.       20      Fair and Effective Markets Review Final Report, HM Treasury, Bank of England and FCA (June 2015).   21      PRA Supervisory Statement | SS28/15 Strengthening individual accountability in banking, May 2017.   22      FX Global Code (2018).   23      FMSB stands for Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities Markets Standards Board.

A decade ago, OTC derivative trades were largely unregulated, unreported and bilaterally settled. When   Lehman fell, uncertainty about such exposures sparked panic.    Since then, the FSB has designed a series of reforms to make these markets safer and more transparent,   including by requiring trade reporting and by encouraging central clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) trades.    These reforms are having their desired effects. Supervisory authorities and market participants can now   readily monitor activity and exposures. 90% of new OTC single-currency interest rate derivatives are now   centrally cleared in the US. And an additional $1 trillion of collateral is now held globally against all derivative   trades.    Central counterparties (CCPs) reduce systemic risk, provided they meet the highest standards of resilience,   recoverability and resolvability. That is why G20 reforms have significantly increased the standards to which   CCPs are held, ranging from higher margins and liquidity to better operational and cyber resilience.28 To   finalise its policy work, the FSB will report to G20 Leaders next month on the need for guidance on CCP   financial resources in resolution.29    Now is the time for FSB members to address any gaps in their supervisory and resolution frameworks for   CCPs. For example, some authorities do not yet have all of the resolution powers expected under FSB   standards. And it�s time for the FSB (in conjunction with CPMI-IOSCO) to assess whether, when taken   together, reforms to resilience, recoverability and resolvability are sufficient and are working as intended.    A decade on from the financial crisis, a series of measures are eliminating the fragile forms of shadow   banking while reinforcing the best of resilient non-bank financial intermediation. The toxic forms of shadow   banking at the heart of the crisis � with their large funding mismatches, high leverage and opaque, off-   balance-sheet arrangements � no longer represent a global stability risk (Chart 4).    And other, more constructive forms of non-bank finance, including money market funds and repo markets,   are subject to new policy measures that reduce their risks and reinforce their benefits.    27      See FMSB Annual Report (2017) for examples of misconduct over two centuries.   28      See CMPI-IOSCO�s Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure (PFMI).   29      FSB Chair�s Letter to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, March 2018.                                                                                                                    8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                    8   However, as the old fault lines close in advanced economies, they are widening in some emerging market   economies.    For example, while China�s economic miracle over the past three decades has been extraordinary, its post-   crisis performance has increasingly relied on a large build-up of debt and an associated explosion of shadow   banking (Chart 5).    The non-bank finance sector has increased from around 10% of GDP a decade ago to over 100% now, with   developments echoing those in the pre-crisis US such as off-balance sheet vehicles with large maturity   mismatches, sharp increases in repo financing, and large contingent liabilities of borrowers and banks.    The Chinese authorities recognise that �this time may not be different� and have begun taking measures to   manage the risks.30    More broadly, a potentially major new vulnerability has emerged across the G20.    This risk starts, as is often the case, with a positive development. Global assets under management have   grown from around $50 trillion a decade ago to $80 trillion in 2017,31 and have accounted for all the increase   in foreign lending to EMEs since the crisis.    This is bringing welcome diversity to the financial system.    At present, however, asset management�s growing importance could increase the risks of sudden stops and   feed more intense capital flow reversals from emerging markets. That is because more than $30 trillion of   assets are held in funds that promise daily liquidity to investors despite investing in potentially illiquid   underlying assets.32    In other words, they are built on the lie that markets always clear.    To assess the risks of fire sales and contagion across emerging and credit markets, authorities need to   gather and share data on asset management. In this context, the FSB expects that consistent and decision-   useful measures of leverage will be developed to support an effective global risk assessment. I would   encourage industry to engage with the upcoming IOSCO consultation on this issue.    The FSB is also refining its Systemic Stress Initiative to explore how funds and other non-bank financial   institutions might collectively act in ways that amplify shocks.33       30      IMF Article IV Consultation for the People�s Republic of China (2018).   31      See Boston Consulting Group estimate of global AUM in Global Asset Management 2018.   32      See FSB Global Shadow Banking Monitoring Report (2017).   33      The Bank of England is working to better understand such dynamics as well. See Baranova, Y., Coen, J., Lowe, P., Noss, J., and   Silvestri, L. �Simulating stress across the financial system: the resilience of corporate bond markets and the role of investment funds�,   Bank of England Financial Stability Paper, (2017).                                                                                                                                           9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                         9   Data and analysis are only the first steps in honouring the FSB�s commitment to G20 Leaders to address the   structural vulnerabilities associated with asset management.34 Authorities and firms must implement the   FSB�s recommendations for greater consistency between funds� redemption terms and their assets and   investment strategies. Funds should have the liquidity management tools to deal with stressed conditions.   And these tools must be able to dampen the impact of first mover advantage on systemic risk.    Given the scale and proximity of the potential risks, in the Bank of England�s view, authorities should review   the adequacy both of its recommendations and their implementation sooner rather than later.35    Policymakers must be alert situations where market innovation once again introduces complexity and   opacity, and excessive reliance on markets always clearing.    For example, global leveraged lending is growing at rates � and has reached a scale � comparable to the   subprime on the eve of the crisis.36 Underwriting criteria have loosened as rapidly,37 the requirement that   managers retain a portion of their securitisations has been overturned by U.S. courts, and there is limited   information on the ability of the ultimate holders of the debt to absorb losses.    To be clear, there are important differences between leveraged lending and sub-prime. In particular, the   banks at core of the system are significantly more resilient and have limited direct or indirect exposures.    But recall that the last two vintages of subprime pre-crisis were twice as likely to default as their   predecessors, and that the leveraged loan market shows few signs of slowing.                                                           ********************    Turning finally to the lie that �This Time is Different�.    If the experience of the financial crisis teaches us anything, it�s humility. We cannot anticipate every risk or   plan for every contingency. But we can, and must, plan for failure. That is how we can create an anti-fragile   system that is robust to both the intensification of known risks and the crystallisation of Rumsfeldian   unknowns.    An anti-fragile system requires resilient banks.    A decade ago, major banks were woefully undercapitalised, with complex business models that relied on the   goodwill of markets and, ultimately, taxpayers.    Large global banks can now stand on their own.      34      See FSB Policy Recommendations to Address Structural Vulnerabilities from Asset Management Activities (2017).   35      FPC record (Q3 2018).   36      Over the past year, leveraged lending has grown by around 15% (or 10% of total advanced economy credit to corporates) as   compared with an estimated 13% growth (or 13% of the total share of US mortgages), for the sub-prime market to 2007.   37      With maintenance covenants falling from close to 100% in 2010 to around 20% now.                                                                                                                                 10     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                10   Their common equity requirements and buffers are now ten times higher than the pre-crisis standard. And to   protect the system from risks we think are low but prove not, banks are subject to a simple, minimum   leverage ratio, which is robust to model risk.    Regulation has made banks less complex and more focused. Business strategies that relied on high   leverage, risky trading activities and wholesale funding are disappearing, as intended. Trading assets have   been cut in half, and interbank lending is down by one-third.38    Not least due to new global liquidity standards, banks have changed their funding models and now hold   substantially more liquid assets relative to the liabilities that can readily run. In the UK, such contingent   liquidity has increased tenfold since the crisis.    An anti-fragile system requires ending Too Big to Fail.    But higher capital and liquidity requirements are necessary but not sufficient. Banks must also be able to fail   without systemic consequences.    A decade ago, large complex banks operated in a �heads I win tails you lose� bubble. They privatised profits   in the run-up to the crisis before socialising the losses when the music stopped.    The complete loss of confidence in private finance that crystallised in the autumn of 2008 could only be   arrested by public support over the following year that t"
2018-11-05	"�50 character selection and Future Forum launch     Remarks given by    Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England       Science Museum, London    Friday 2 November 2018       I am grateful to Clare Macallan and Jennifer Nemeth for their assistance in drafting these remarks and   to Lizzie Levett, Emma Sinclair and Toby Davies for providing background information.                                                                                                             1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx   It is always a pleasure to visit the Science Museum. Its galleries and exhibitions showcase the rich history of   human ingenuity in the sciences, technology, and medicine.    You might think that the Bank of England has little in common with such lofty endeavours, but science spans   all aspects of life, extending even to central banking.    Within this Mathematics Gallery alone, there are multiple examples of where the worlds of central banking   and science converge.    Take the Moniac machine, which illustrates the circular flow of income around the economy using an   assortment of pipes and coloured water.    Or Babbage�s Analytical Engine, developed in collaboration with mathematician Ada Lovelace. This   precursor to modern computers helped estimate mortality rates, techniques that are still central to   underwriting life insurance policies today. The same life insurers that we regulate at the Bank of England.    Among those who are supervising, modelling and policymaking, are the Bank�s very own scientists. Almost   10% of colleagues across the Bank have a science or maths degree and 1 in 10 of our graduates starting   this year studied chemistry, biology or physics at university.    We very much value the skills and diversity they bring to our efforts, so in a short recruitment pitch, when you   �Think Science�, think too of central banking. After all, science starts with curiosity and asking the right   questions. Science teaches people to conduct dedicated research and disciplined analysis. These skills   and talents make a good supervisor, policymaker or senior leader, and they are the reason that the Bank   increasingly recruits from beyond the field of economics.    Not least because scientific advances in Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are reshaping our world,   transforming the nature of both work and commerce. This revolution will impact all aspects of the Bank�s   work, from the future of work, through its effects on employment, productivity and wages, to the future of   finance, as the nature of customer service, trading and risk management transforms.    These advances in science and technology are also transforming our focus today � money. They are making   digital money more like its physical counterpart � instant, anonymous and direct.    And scientific advances are modernising physical currency, cash, which still has a hugely important role in   society.    We use a host of technologies to protect our physical banknotes against counterfeiting. The switch to   polymer has allowed us to introduce new security features, including see-through panels, coloured foils and   detailed metallic images. Polymer also makes our banknotes stronger, with a lifespan two and a half times   that of paper notes, and greener, because they will be recycled when they reach the end of their useful lives.   Science means that the costs of producing notes � both economic and environmental � are lower.                                                                                                                   2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                2   This is good for the society; the society that the Bank of England serves; and the society that is reflected on   our banknotes. The Bank is committed to ensuring that the nation�s money is as inclusive as possible.   Being inclusive means:        -   ensuring our notes are accessible to everyone. That�s why we have increased the range of features           that help the blind and visually impaired distinguish between different denominations, adding tactile           dots in the upper left-hand corner. These dots join existing features, such as differing colour           palettes, raised print, tiered sizing and bold numerals; and        -   being inclusive means an open and transparent approach to decide the characters that feature on           our banknotes, by seeking nominations from the public, which can then be considered by an           Advisory Panel.    Today, I�m here to deliver on that second objective. Following the success of the polymer fiver and tenner,   and the forthcoming �20, last month the Bank confirmed that it will issue a new �50 note.    And this new �50 will need a new character to feature on its design.    I am delighted to announce today that the field from which nominations will be sought for the new �50 note is   � if you hadn�t guessed by now � science.    Our Advisory Panel chose science in recognition of the United Kingdom�s extraordinary scientific heritage.    In the pre-industrial era, the laws of motion and discovery of hydrogen were foundational achievements by   UK scientists. They paved the way for future scientific progress � from autos to aerospace � so that present   day heroes like Lewis Hamilton and astronauts Tim Peake and Helen Sharman truly �stand on the shoulders   of giants� [Newton, 1675] and continue the legacy of UK-led innovation.    The invention in the UK of the steam engine, electric motor and telegraph powered the first two industrial   revolutions, bringing our world closer together and bringing prosperity to many.    In medicine and biology, the discoveries of penicillin, x-rays and the double helix by UK scientists afforded   people healthier and longer lives.    Meanwhile, the creation of the world wide web by Tim Berners Lee brought the sum of human knowledge to   the masses in the third industrial revolution. The UK is expanding this frontier in the fourth industrial   revolution through the development of Artificial Intelligence with the likes of Demis Hassabis.    Scientific terms like black holes in vitro and Higgs Boson particles are now part of our vocabulary thanks to   pioneering UK scientists who have popularised science and brought it into the mainstream. This high regard   of the sciences shows up in polls and currency alike. From Darwin to Newton, eminent UK scientists are   regulars on top 100 Britons lists and have featured on some of our historic banknotes.                                                                                                                     3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                 3   It is this glorious history of innovation and impact that the Bank seeks to celebrate on the new �50.    The new fifty will complement the celebration of literature on the Austen tenner, statecraft on the Churchill   fiver, and the arts on the Turner Twenty coming in 2020. With the introduction of the new �50, the nation�s   banknotes will honour a wide range of UK achievement.    In selecting characters for the nation�s banknotes, we are looking for someone from Great Britain or Northern   Ireland who has made an invaluable contribution to UK society � be it through pioneering innovation,   exceptional leadership, shaping this diverse society and forging its common values. As has always been the   case, the Bank will not represent living people or fictional characters on our banknotes. I�m afraid that   means Time Lords, of whatever gender, are sadly ineligible, despite their enduring popularity.    In submitting nominations, we are encouraging the public to think creatively and widely about what �science�   means. The Advisory Panel will consider individuals from the multitude of disciplines that fall within the   general umbrella of science, from astronomy, biology and civil engineering through to zoology, and   everything in between.    For further inspiration, the Bank has prepared a short video.    You can submit nominations anytime from today until the nominations period closes six weeks from now on   14 December. The Bank expects to announce a final decision in the summer next year.                                                            ***********************    We look to history when we chose a new character, but money has a future not just a past.    The selection of the new �50 note character is not my only announcement today� because as I alluded to   earlier, money is evolving. Today, it is much more than polymer.    While cash remains invaluable to many, it is now the second most frequent transaction method after debit   card payments.1 And innovation is expected to make other electronic forms of payment easier to make and   faster to settle.    The technological revolution in finance will bring more tailored products, keener pricing, and more diverse   sources of credit for households and SMEs.    The Bank is embracing fintech and ensuring that it develops in ways that maximise the opportunities and   minimise the risks for society.    We aim to enable, empower and ensure.       1       Cash transactions made up 37% of all transactions in 2017.                                                                                                                   4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                 4   Enable new technology by developing the right environment for fintech to thrive, such as by upgrading the   Bank�s hard infrastructure on which finance relies � such as our large value payments system, RTGS. The   Bank is one of the first to allow non-bank payment service providers to directly access its system, something   that is lowering the costs of payments across borders.    Enabling also means having the right soft infrastructure, such as rules and regulations, to help fintech thrive.   This includes improving how we capture data from our hard infrastructure in a consistent and usable form   while ensuring privacy.    We must also empower new providers to promote competition by lowering barriers to entry through   proportionate supervision and assuring a level playing field in access to our hard infrastructure.    Finally, we continue to ensure these new technologies add diversity and resilience to the financial system.    How we enable, empower and ensure is the focus of the Bank�s Future of Finance work. Just as with the   �50, we are soliciting the UK public�s contributions to �decide the future of money� through Bank�s Future   Forum.    We want to know how you make payments now and in the future (with cash, by card or through a QR code?)   What do you expect from finance and the financial system? And we want to discuss how your central bank   can make this happen.    This is the Bank�s third Future Forum, following events in Liverpool last year and Birmingham the year   before.    We are taking a digital approach this year, hosting it on-line so that we can reach a wider audience,   engaging with people from all backgrounds across the UK.    Throughout the Forum, you can log on to the website to ask questions, post ideas and challenge us. We will   be hosting live on-line Q&A sessions with each of the Bank�s Governors, starting with Dave Ramsden,   Deputy Governor for Markets and Banking, on 5 November. We�re launching a payments challenge � limit   payments to either cash or card for a week and tell us about your experience and the challenges faced. And   school children will have the opportunity to win a guest blog slot on Bank Underground and enter the Bank   Camera Action Competition.    The Forum will run until 16 January 2019, culminating in a roundtable discussion between the Governors and   members of the public drawn from the most engaged users of the platform. This will be live streamed to all.   People can find out more, register their interest, and join the conversations on the Bank of England�s   website.2       2       To register please visit www.bankfoenglandfutureforum.co.uk or email futureforum@bankofengland.co.uk.                                                                                                                 5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                5   To conclude, let me go back to the future, returning to the character field for the �50 note. To sift through the   public nominations and help decide the final character, the Banknote Advisory Panel will be joined by four   new scientists, Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock MBE, Dr Emily Grossman, Dr Simon Singh MBE, Professor Simon   Schaffer.    I�m pleased to welcome one of these scientists here today. Maggie Aderin Pocock, space scientist and   familiar voice from the BBC�s Sky at Night, has been a long-term advocate of engaging the public in science,   having presented to a quarter of a million people throughout her career (with science it�s all about numbers).    Thank you Maggie for donating your time to this important task. We will benefit greatly from your expertise   on the Banknote Advisory Panel. So without further delay, let me hand over to Maggie to give you a   scientist�s perspective on the importance of�science.                                                                                                                     6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                 6"
2018-11-22	"Remarks at the Accounting for Sustainability Summit 2018     Remarks given by   Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England       Accounting for Sustainability Forum, St. James�s Palace   London     21 November 2018       I am grateful to Alice Carr, Emma Dalhuijsen, Edd Denbee, Vishal Desai, Sini Matikainen and Jennifer   Nemeth for their assistance in preparing these remarks.                                                                                                           1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx   I would like to thank His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and Accounting for Sustainability for inviting me   today. It is an honour to be able to mark his 70th birthday in this way.    We are gathered at St James� Palace, but not for a lavish celebration. It is to HRH�s credit that this happy   occasion is marked by a serious discussion of the risks and opportunities posed by climate change and the   transition to a low carbon economy.    His Royal Highness has provided inspirational leadership on these critical issues for decades. Indeed if we   had heeded his advice when it was first offered, we might have already solved the Tragedy of the Horizon!   Examples of HRH�s leadership range:           ?    From domestic initiatives within The Prince's Responsible Business Network to help ensure UK               businesses and communities are resilient to the effects of climate change;           ?    To launching the ClimateWise Principles and encouraging the insurance industry to take a leading               role in addressing risks posed by climate change;           ?    To support for our hosts Accounting for Sustainability, who have for many years given practical               guidance to firms on how to embed sustainability considerations into business decision-making.    I have had the great pleasure of engaging with HRH on a number of occasions, and I can think of few people   more knowledgeable about the sustainability agenda or as committed to it. Four years ago, he rightly put me   on the spot, highlighting that climate-related risks will have serious financial impacts, and asking what   regulators were doing about them.    HRH�s challenges are even more germane today as the impacts of climate change continue to mount and   the time to act continues to shorten.    This year has seen blistering heatwaves in North America and Europe, hurricanes in North America and   typhoons in South East Asia; droughts in Southern Africa and Australia; unprecedented rainfall causing   deadly landslides in Japan; and now the devastating wildfires in California. The human costs of these events   are immeasurable.    And the financial losses are significant. Last year set a record for weather-related insurance losses at   around $140bn.1 Losses in 2018 may again be among the worst in history. This is an extension of a   worrying pattern that has seen the number of extreme weather events more than triple and inflation-adjusted   insured losses rise five-fold in the past three decades.2       1       See Munich Reinsurance Company (2018), �A stormy year: Natural catastrophes 2017,� Geo Risks Research, NatCatSERVICE   2       Ibid.                                                                                                                              2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                            2   The outlook is even more concerning. As noted by HRH, last month�s IPCC report shows that many land   and ocean ecosystems have already changed due to global warming.3 It concludes that the physical risks   of climate change will intensify even under 1.5 degrees of warming, including increased heatwaves,   droughts, heavy rain, flooding, melting of sea ice, and species loss. In turn, this will have a marked impact on   human health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth.    And that is very much the IPCC�s best case scenario. The impacts will be significantly worse under 2   degrees, and the Paris commitments � even if fully implemented � are consistent with more than 2.7 degrees   of warming.4    The longer meaningful adjustment is delayed, the more transition risks will rise. To deliver on the Paris   Agreement commitments and limit temperatures to 1.5�C, carbon emissions would have to decline by about   45% from 2010 levels to 2030 to reach net zero around 2050.5 Even if this happens smoothly, it will have   major implications for most sectors of our economies.    If the transition is delayed and then happens abruptly, financial stability risks will rise considerably.    Given this combination of immediate physical risks and prospective transition risks, the Bank of England has   become increasingly active consistent with our financial stability and prudential mandates.    In 2015, we examined the impact of climate change on the UK insurance industry.6 General insurers and   reinsurers are on the front line of managing the physical risks from climate change, and they have responded   by developing their modelling and forecasting capabilities, improving exposure management, and then   adapting coverage and pricing accordingly. One of the lessons they have taken on board is that yesterday�s   tail risk is closer to today�s central scenario.    Sadly, with respect to climate, history repeats not as farce but as tragedy, with growing frequency.    Despite the sophistication of insurers, there are some gaps in their risk management. The Bank is   increasingly focused on cognitive dissonance in some insurers whose careful management of climate risks   on the liability side of their balance sheets is not always matched by similar considerations on the asset side.   With that in mind, we expect firms to consider stress testing and scenario analysis as part of their   assessment of the impact of climate risk on their balance sheet and broader business strategy. This will also   be reflected in our own market-wide insurance stress test exercises.    For banks, the financial risks from climate change have tended to be beyond their planning horizons. The   PRA�s recent survey of 90% of the UK banking sector found that these horizons averaged four years � in    3     See IPCC (2018), �Global Warming of 1.5 �C,� http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/   4     As estimated at the time of the Paris Accord. According to the UN Emissions Gap Report (2017), full implementation of the   unconditional pledges of the Paris Agreement is consistent with a temperature increase of 3.2� by 2100, relative to pre-industrial levels.   Implementation of the conditional NDCs would lower the projected warming by 0.2�.   5     IPCC (2018).   6     See PRA (2015), �The Impact of Climate Change on the UK Insurance Sector�, September 2015.                                                                                                                                          3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                          3   other words, before risks would be expected to be fully realised and prior to ambitious climate policies taking   effect.7    Our latest report finds that the majority of banks are starting to treat the risks from climate change like other   financial risks � rather than viewing them simply as a corporate social responsibility issue. For some firms,   oversight of the financial risks from climate change and overall responsibility for setting the strategy, targets   and risk appetite relating to these risks is beginning to be considered at the board level.    Banks have begun considering the most immediate physical risks to their business models � from the   exposure of mortgage books to flood risk, to the impact of extreme weather events on sovereign risk. And   they have started to assess exposures to transition risks where government policy is already pulling forward   the adjustment. This includes exposures to carbon-intensive sectors, consumer loans secured on diesel   vehicles, and buy-to-let lending given new energy efficiency requirements.    But many banks have some way to go to identify and measure the financial risks from climate change   comprehensively. This requires strategic board oversight and more dynamic scenario analysis so actions   today can be considered in light of future impacts.    Informed by these findings, the PRA published in October a draft supervisory statement for banks, insurers   and investments firms which sets out expectations regarding firms� approaches to managing the financial   risks from climate change.8 The supervisory statement gives guidance in four key areas: governance, risk   management, scenario analysis, and disclosure.    Recognising the need to build capacity and to develop best practice, the PRA is establishing a Climate   Financial Risk Forum, jointly with the FCA, to work with firms from across the financial system to advance   approaches to managing climate-related financial risks.    And the Bank of England is working in close collaboration with central banks and supervisors from around   the world as one of the founding members of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS).   The NGFS brings together authorities from jurisdictions responsible for almost half the world�s emissions to   share analysis and develop policies to climate-related risks and green finance.    A4S    A4S has long recognised that the business community needs to consider the risks and opportunities   presented by climate change. The private sector will drive the transition to a low carbon economy and   contribute to countries meeting the commitments made in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Reducing emissions   will require significant investments in new technologies and infrastructures.     7    See PRA (2018), �Transition in thinking: The impact of climate change on the UK banking sector,� September 2018.   8    See PRA (2018), �Enhancing banks� and insurers� approaches to managing the financial risks from climate change,� Consultation   Paper 23/18, October 2018.                                                                                                                                    4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                  4   A4S� Financing our Future report highlights the need for everyone in the investment chain to act: from   individuals managing their savings, to financial intermediaries investing in the real economy, to regulators   and policymakers creating the frameworks for action, to real economy firms investing in new processes,   products and services.    TCFD    Doing so requires the right information. That�s why in 2015, in response to a call from G20 leaders, the   Financial Stability Board (FSB) established the private sector Task Force on Climate-related Financial   Disclosure (TCFD) under the leadership of Michael Bloomberg.    The TCFD delivered � to the Hamburg G20 Leaders� Summit last year � final recommendations for voluntary   disclosures of material, decision-useful climate-related financial risks.9 Suitable for use by all companies that   raise capital, the recommendations:           ?    Include disclosure of governance, strategy and risk management;           ?    Establish consistent and comparable metrics and targets applicable across all sectors, as well as               specific metrics for the most carbon-intense industries;           ?    Encourage use of scenario analysis in order to assess the potential impact of the risks and               opportunities of the transition to a low carbon economy on strategy and financial planning.    The combination of the Paris Accord and the TCFD has led a clear transition in thinking and action about   climate-related financial risks.    Consider the changes in demand, supply and impact of climate disclosure.    The demand for climate-related financial disclosure from the providers of capital has increased significantly.   Current supporters of the TCFD include three-quarters of the world�s globally systemic banks, 8 of the top 10   global asset managers, the world�s leading pension funds and insurers, major credit rating agencies, the Big   Four accounting firms, and the two dominant shareholder advisory service companies.    These financial firms are responsible for managing nearly US$100 trillion in assets (or 20% more than global   GDP).    With climate-related shareholder resolutions tripling last year and litigation risks rising, the incentives for   companies to disclose and manage climate-related risks have increased dramatically.    Not surprisingly, the supply of climate disclosure is responding. Over 500 organisations have endorsed the   TCFD recommendations, with a total market capitalisation of US$8 trillion.    9       See TCFD (2017), �Final Report: Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures,� June 2017.                                                                                                                                 5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                               5   The implementation report issued by the Task Force in September 201810 � a year after the   recommendations were first published � assessed some 1800 companies (that made some reference to   climate in their reporting) using artificial intelligence, and analysed in more detail an additional 200 of the   largest companies, drawn from eight representative sectors.    Across both, it found that a majority of companies already disclose information in their 2017 filings that   aligned with one or more of the TCFD�s recommendations. Reporting by the largest companies appears to   have been more sophisticated � with a higher share of the firms reporting against more of the TCFD   recommendations.    This is remarkable given companies only had about six months to respond to the final TCFD   recommendations in their 2017 filings.    That said, compared to both the recommendations and user expectations, more progress is needed. In   particular,           ?    Financial implications are often not yet disclosed           ?    Disclosures are often in multiple reports making comparisons harder           ?    Disclosure varies by industry and region, with higher percentages of European firms, as well as               higher shares of those on the climate frontline � such as the energy sector � disclosing information               aligned with the recommendations; and           ?    Disclosure is weakest with respect to strategic resilience which is the topic of greatest interest to               most capital providers.    As they look to enhance their disclosures, TCFD members are supported by various TCFD Preparers�   Forums, which have been established to help firms prepare disclosures, for example the Oil and Gas   industry group convened by the World Business Council on Sustainable Development and the Institute of   International Finance for banks.    A4S� implementation workshops are exactly the sort of collaborative processes which will help ensure that   the TCFD recommendations are implemented in a consistent manner.    This is particularly important for more complex parts of the TCFD framework like scenario analysis and its   interpretation. As A4S has identified, managing climate-related risks will require firms to assess the   resilience of their business strategies: where they are now, where they are going and how they will get there.       10        See TCFD (2018), �2018 Status Report�, September 2018.                                                                                                                       6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                     6   Scenario analysis will be part of this over time (and there are already some good examples) but most   important at this stage will be for companies to demonstrate that they have the governance processes and   strategic flexibility to consider and manage the opportunities associated with different climate pathways.    Adoption can be expected to widen and improve as the private sector refines emerging good practice in   efficient, decision-useful climate-related disclosure. To continue the momentum behind the Task Force�s   recommendations, the TCFD will provide a major implementation report to the Japanese G20 Presidency.    Impact    The impacts of these developments could be enormous.    TCFD�s voluntary disclosure is creating a virtuous circle by encouraging learning by doing: as companies   apply the recommendations, investors are increasingly differentiating between firms based on the information   they receive. As good practice emerges, adoption will continue to spread, disclosure will become more   decision-useful and efficient, and its impact will grow.    As climate disclosure moves into the mainstream, it is increasingly seen as necessary in and of itself, and as   informative about which companies are focused on long-term value creation.    Moreover, as a �market� in the transition to a 2 degree world is built, it can pull forward adjustment by the   private sector � particularly if the policy responses of governments and the prospects for private sector   innovation are credible.    Finally, as stressed by HRH, the transition to a low-carbon economy will bring unparalleled opportunities for   companies minded to seize them.    For example, the IEA estimates that the transition could require $3.5trn in energy sector investments a year   for decades � twice the rate at present.11 By 2050 we will need nearly 95% of electricity supply to be low   carbon, 70% of new cars electric, retrofitting of the entire building stock, and an 80% fall in the CO2 intensity   of the building sector.12    With an estimated US$90 trillion of infrastructure investment expected between 2015 and 2030, smart   decisions now can make sure that investment is both financially sound and environmentally sustainable.13    Investing in more sustainable agriculture could deliver an estimated US$2 trillion in economic benefits per   year and generate millions of jobs, while also improving food security and reducing GHG emissions.14   Reducing air pollution could not only prevent millions of premature deaths per year, but avoid over       11      See IEA (2017), �Perspectives for the Energy Transition - Investment Needs for a Low-Carbon Energy System.�   12      Ibid.   13      New Climate Economy (2018), �The 2018 Report of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.�                                                                                                                    7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                  7   $350 billion in lost productivity and health impacts.15    Getting climate disclosure right will mean that investment flows to firms which are managing the risks and   seizing the opportunities. Ensuring our banks and insurers are resilient to climate-related risks will reinforce   this process while keeping the financial system open for UK households and businesses in all types of   weather.

It is a pleasure to meet in Frobisher Hall today. This hall is named after Sir Martin Frobisher, an English   navigator who explored Canada�s eastern arctic coast in the 16th century in search of new trade routes.    His connection to the Barbican is that most of him is buried in the St Giles-in-the-Fields churchyard. (His   heart and entrails are in St Andrew�s Church in Plymouth).    Martin Frobisher is perhaps more famous in Canada than in his native land. One of the great bays in the   eastern arctic is named after him. The capital of Nunavut, Iqaluit, lies at the innermost end of Frobisher Bay.    Nine years ago this month Iqaluit hosted the G7 meeting that marked the start of the euro crisis. Events that   still reverberate today including in the environs of the Barbican.    While the debate in the United Kingdom has been understandably dominated by Brexit, the world has been   otherwise engaged.    When the Referendum was being held, the global economy was emerging from a long period of financial   repair and lacklustre growth. Over the subsequent two years, a widespread and increasingly vigorous global   expansion took hold. For the first time since the financial crisis, business investment and foreign trade grew   strongly across all major regions. Economic uncertainty diminished, and consumer and business confidence   firmed. In economies close to full employment, real wages finally began to grow.    A new beginning seemed possible.    In the past few quarters, however, these trends have largely reversed. After peaking a year ago around 4%,   global momentum is now weakening in all major regions and downside risks have intensified. The proportion   of the global economy growing above trend has fallen from four-fifths to one-third. Trade growth has slowed   and the export outlook has dimmed. Capital goods orders are stagnating, investment growth has become   more tepid, and business confidence is diminished (Chart 1).

Last year, the returns on all major asset classes from equities to   credit to sovereign debt were negative. Cash once again was king.

The tightening of financial conditions globally partly reflected the usual � if somewhat delayed � reaction to   the tightening of monetary policy.1 Over the past year, the withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation   gathered pace. The Fed raised interest rates four times, and the Bank of England and ten other G20 central   banks also tightened policy. In addition, after five years in which there was no new net issuance of G7   government debt, new government borrowing outweighed central bank purchases by more than $1 trillion for   the first time since 2012.     Potentially more seriously, the slowing in global momentum may also be the product of rising trade tensions   and growing policy uncertainty. Global economic policy uncertainty is at record highs (Chart 3). And   protectionist rhetoric is becoming reality, with the United States raising tariffs on a range of imports from its   main trading partners, and some retaliating in kind (see Annex Table A1). If all measures contemplated are   implemented, average US tariffs will reach rates not seen in half a century.       1     Overall, financial conditions in the US have tightened by around half a standard deviation over the course the current   tightening cycle thus far (Chart 2). This is a similar cumulative increase as in the 2004-06 tightening cycle, though   somewhat less than in the cycle at the turn of the millennium � a pattern is broadly mirrored across advanced economies   more generally.                                                                                                                        3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                        3   Chart 3: Indices of global economic policy uncertainty are at record highs                                                                                                                       5                                                               Standard deviations from historical average                                                                                                                      4                                                                                                                       3                                                                                                                       2                                                                                                                       1                                                                                                                       0                                                                                                                       -1                                                                                                                       -2       1997   1999      2001      2003      2005        2007   2009     2011      2013      2015      2017    Sources: Bloom et al (2015)2 and Bank calculations      Given the confluence of the current broad-based slowdown and outstanding downside risks, some are   beginning to wonder whether the global expansion, begun in 2010, could be starting to end.     Recessions are notoriously difficult to predict. The IMF has anticipated only a sixth of the over 300   recessions in member countries since 1991. Financial markets are more likely to cry wolf, making Paul   Samuelson�s observation fifty years ago that �the stock market has predicted nine of the past five recessions�   as relevant today as it was then.3 For what it is worth, market-implied probabilities of a recession in the US   are around 20%, nearly three times higher relative to this time a year ago (Chart 4).     There are multiple definitions of what constitutes a global recession. Some have used a benchmark of global   GDP growth falling below 2�% or 3%, whilst the IMF uses a definition of a fall in global GDP per capita.4 On   the IMF�s definition, there have been four global recessions since WWII: in 1975, 1982, 1991 and 2009.       2     See: Baker, S, Bloom, N and Davis, S (2015) Measuring economic policy uncertainty, NBER Working Paper No.21633   3     From Samuelson�s 1966 column �Science and Stocks� in Newsweek.   4     This is equivalent to global GDP growth falling below the current rate of population growth of 1%.                                                                                                                 4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                 4   Chart 4: Market-implied probabilities of a US recession have risen                                                                                                    Per cent    100                                                                                                               90                                                                                                               80                                                                                                               70                                                                                                               60                                                                                                               50                                                                                                               40                                                                                                               30                                                                                                               20                                                                                                               10                                                                                                               0       1973    1978       1983       1988       1993       1998       2003       2008       2013        2018                                  NBER recessions                        Fed recession indicator    Sources: Federal Reserve Board; NBER.

To assess whether recent global developments represent a soft patch or herald renewed stagnation, it is   helpful to consider the position of the global economy with respect to three interrelated cycles: the business   cycle, the financial cycle and the cycle of globalisation.    In each cycle, imbalances can build that hasten their demise, so I will focus on a few of the most important   imbalances to assess global prospects.      The Business Cycle    The business cycle tracks fluctuations in demand about the supply potential of the economy. In the   expansion phase, growth in output exceeds that of the economy�s supply capacity. As a result, costs rise   more quickly as companies use resources more intensively, putting upward pressure on inflation. When   output growth falls below potential, the opposite occurs. Business cycles have historically lasted up to eight   years on average across advanced economies.5 Recent experience suggests the expansionary phase is   getting longer, and the downturn shorter, partly because of the greater credibility of monetary policy.6       5     In the UK and US, the average duration has been 5 � years, based respectively on Hills et al (2010) and the National   Bureau of Economic Research�s business cycle dating committee (http://www.nber.org/cycles.html).   6     See, for example, Miles, D, Panizza,U, Reis, R and Ubide, A (2017) �And Yet It Moves. Inflation and the Great   Moderation�, Geneva Reports on the World Economy 19.                                                                                                                        5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                      5   Business cycles can be first amplified and then imperilled by growing imbalances in the real economy, such   as over-investment in capital and housing, debt-fuelled consumption, or, particularly in emerging economies,   excess current account imbalances that can lead to sudden stops.7    And imbalances can manifest themselves in rising inflation. In those advanced economies closest to full   employment like the US and the UK, wage pressures have picked up as slack has been absorbed. A similar   pattern is observable in the euro area (Chart 5). In the UK, private sector wage growth has increased from   around 1% five years ago, to 2% 3 years ago; 2�% last year to 3 � % today as unemployment has fallen   below its natural rate.

Data frequency is   quarterly.      The recent Anglo Saxon experience suggests the wage Phillips Curve is alive and well, if not particularly   steeply sloped. The pick-up of wages is slowly feeding through to core inflation, which is now close to 2% in   both the US and UK.    Globally, inflation has moderated as commodity prices have fallen back, consistent with the slower pace of   global growth, and some evidence of slack emerging in a range of economies.      7    Such imbalances can themselves build up in an over-reaction to deeper phenomena such as an increase in total factor   productivity growth or a temporary surge in growth in the workforce resulting from technological change. Such   development can result in over-investment if firms and households are overoptimistic about their duration.                                                                                                                    6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                    6   Financial markets now expect more accommodative than previously monetary policies in all major economic   areas (Chart 6), and in China, the PBOC has taken a number of measures to provide stimulus.8    Chart 6: Financial markets expect more accommodative monetary policy than they did in 2018                                                                                                        Per cent                                                                                                                     3.5          Solid lines: February 2019 Inflation Report          Dashed lines: November 2018 Inflation Report                                                               3.0                                                      United States                                                   2.5                                                                                                                      2.0                                        Federal funds rate                                                                                  United Kingdom                     1.5                Bank Rate                                                                                             1.0                                                                          Euro area                                   0.5                                                                                                                      0.0                                                                                                                      -0.5            ECB main refinancing rate             ECB deposit rate                                                                                                                     -1.0     2014                      2016                      2018                      2020                      2022    Sources: Bank of England, Bloomberg Finance L.P., ECB, Federal Reserve, Eikon from Refinitiv and Bank calculations.     Provided the expansion continues, a modest tightening of monetary policy over time will likely be sufficient to   achieve inflation targets. Policy can remain limited and gradual, as well as data dependent.    Both these guides to monetary policy reflect the historically low level of the equilibrium interest rate, or r*.9   As the Bank of England has long emphasised, a number of forces have depressed r* 10 � a view that has   been validated by muted inflation over the past five years, despite a long period of historically low interest   rates.11 As the Federal Reserve has observed, incoming data will provide important information about the   evolution of the equilibrium rate.12      8     The PBOC have introduced several easing measures since April 2018 including cuts to the reserve requirement ratio,   relaxing capital requirements for banks, and introducing credit support for private businesses.   9     The equilibrium interest rate is the level of the real policy rate that, if allowed to prevail for several years, would place   economic activity at its potential and keep inflation low and stable.   10      A set of profound forces in the world economy, both secular and cyclical, has pushed down on the level of world real   interest rates over the past 30 years by as much as 450 basis points - see Carney, M (2013), �The spirit of the season�   and Rachel, L and Smith, T (2015), �Secular drivers of the global real interest rate�, Bank of England Working Paper No.   571). The global equilibrium interest rate is likely to rise in coming years as some of the shorter-term factors pushing it   down ease. For example, the process of private sector balance sheet repair is nearing an end and the global stance of   fiscal policy is shifting from contractionary to expansionary. Any rise in potential productivity growth would also boost the   equilibrium rate. The scope for the equilibrium rate to rise will also be greater if spare capacity is larger than currently   estimated.   11      See Carney, M (2018), �Guidance, Contingencies and Brexit�.   12      For example, as explained by Richard Clarida in his speech �Data Dependence and US Monetary Policy�, 27   November 2018.                                                                                                                               7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                               7   In the MPC�s projections published last week, the balance of headwinds to growth and more accommodative   policies are expected to return global growth to around potential rates by the end of the year (Table 1).

Notes: 2018-21 figures show annual average growth rates. Potential growth is calculated as an average from 2019-2021.     This is the most likely scenario unless there are shocks from the other two cycles.     The Financial Cycle    The global financial crisis was a painful reminder that the business cycle is not the only source of   imbalances. Indeed, imbalances at the heart of the financial cycle have been the best predictors of   downturns in recent decades.    The financial cycle tracks the rise and fall in leverage and financial conditions around their sustainable levels.   Compared to the business cycle, the financial cycle is greater in amplitude, slower moving and longer lasting,   sometimes taking up to 20 years between peaks.    As an economy expands, risk taking increases and lending constraints are relaxed. Debt and asset prices   rise, reinforcing each other. Towards the top of the cycle balance sheets appear strong but are increasingly   fragile. Equity and asset valuations are flattered by mark-to-market profits. Debt sustainability is vulnerable   to shocks.    At the very top irrationality sets in. Current conditions are assumed to continue forever. �House prices can   only go up.� �Financial innovation reduces risk.� �Markets always clear.� People fall for the old lies and   unknowingly take great risks secure in the belief that this time is different.    To find a silver lining in the storm clouds of the financial crisis, there has been an explosion of work into how   best to track the financial cycle and avoid its damaging extremes.                                                                                                                         8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                     8   A range of indicators are now monitored routinely by bodies, such as the Financial Policy Committee (FPC),   tasked with maintaining financial stability. And many countries, including the UK, now have a range of   macro-prudential tools to cut excesses off at source, before they affect wider economic prospects.    On the surface, global debt burdens are alarming. The outstanding stock of debt has almost doubled since   the crisis. Public debt burdens across advanced economies have risen above 90% of GDP for the first time   since WWII. Public sector debt is important for intergenerational equity, and high levels of public   indebtedness tend to result in lower growth over the long run.13 But history suggests that high public debt is   generally a chronic not an acute problem. Provided fiscal frameworks remain credible, public debt tends to   be less informative for predicting recessions.     Research at the Bank of England and elsewhere finds that private sector credit growth is amongst the best   early warning indicators of a downturn.14 Over half of recessions are preceded by private sector credit   booms. And within advanced economies, two-thirds of private credit booms have also ended in recessions.15     As borrowers take on more debt and devote a greater share of cash flows to servicing it, they become more   vulnerable to shocks. And there will always be shocks. Debt may not be the proximate cause of the crisis,   but it can be the vulnerability that turns shock into slump.     At present, aggregate private financial imbalances in advanced economies do not appear large enough, on   their own, to tip global activity from slowing to stalling. Private sector credit growth has averaged less than   3% in the UK, US and the euro area over the past decade, generally less than nominal GDP growth.   Aggregate debt servicing ratios are below historic averages, in part due to low equilibrium interest rates.     Although there are pockets of risk, heat maps that mechanically bring together several credit measures   remain relatively cool overall (Chart 7) � though aggregates can hide important pockets of risk that can   amplify negative shocks, and, as I�ll discuss, it is a different picture for China.       13      See Reinhart, C, Rogoff, K, (2010), Growth in a Time of Debt, American Economic Review.   14      For example, see Bridges, J, Jackson, C, McGregor, D (2017) Down in the slumps: the role of credit in five decades of   recessions, Bank of England Staff Working Paper N. 659; Borio, C, Drehmann, M, Xia, D (2018) The financial cycle and   recession risk, BIS quarterly review; Taylor, A, Schularick, M (2012) Credit Booms Gone Bust: Monetary Policy,   Leverage Cycles, and Financial Crises, 1870-2008, American Economic Review; Aikman, D, Bridges, J, Kashyap, A,   Siegart, C (2018) Would macroprudential regulation have prevented the last crisis?, Bank of England Staff Working   Paper N. 747.   15      There are various definitions of a credit boom in the empirical literature � for a brief summary see Gorton, G, Ordo�ez,   G (2019), Good Booms, Bad Booms, forthcoming in the Journal of the European Economic Association. The share of   recessions preceded by credit booms is fairly stable at around 55% under several definitions, for both advanced   economies and emerging markets. The share of credit booms which end in a recession varies from half to two-thirds.                                                                                                                           9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                           9   Chart 7: Heat-map of credit indicators are relatively cool       Sources: Bank of International Settlements (BIS) and Bank calculations.

Digging a little deeper, household balance sheets have generally improved. Whereas in the lead-up to the   global financial crisis, household debt in the US, UK and major euro-area economies16 rose by almost 40   percentage points relative to income, since then households have delevered by an average of 11 percentage   points.17 UK households have gone further, de-levering by about 20 per cent of income. The share of highly   indebted UK households has fallen to 1% from a pre-crisis peak of almost 3%. It would take a rise in interest   rates of 300bps to bring this share back up to its historical average.18    Corporate debt is more of a concern, particularly in the US.    Like households, companies repaired their balance sheets following the crisis but unlike households,   corporates then went back to the well. Relative to earnings, aggregate corporate debt in the US and UK is    16      Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands.   17      Household credit growth has been subdued, rising at an annual rate of less than 5% in each of the UK, US and euro   area for the past decade, compared to rates of over 12% in the US and UK pre-crisis.   18      Highly indebted households are defined as those with debt servicing ratios of more than 40%.                                                                                                                            10     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                           10   nearing pre-crisis peaks,19 and the distribution is worsening. In the UK, the share of highly levered   companies is above pre-crisis levels. This is despite the very modest growth in investment.    Globally, the average quality of corporate borrowers has deteriorated materially. The share of lower-rated   debt in global corporate bond markets has increased significantly over the last 10 years, with BBB-rated   bonds now about half of the market compared to just a quarter in 2007.    The global leveraged lending market grew by 21% in 2018, faster than the rate of growth in US subprime   mortgages in the run up to the crisis. At $2.3 trillion, the stock of outstanding leveraged loans is double that   of subprime in 2007. Leverage of the most indebted issuers has been increasing rapidly (Chart 8).    60% of leveraged loans are now covenant-light and most deals have substantial �add backs� of EBITDA.20   These are developments analogous to the �No Doc / No Income� heyday of US subprime.    To add to the sense of d�j� vu, growth in leveraged loans has been increasingly driven by securitisation.

2019-03-22	"A New Horizon      Speech given by    Mark Carney, Governor Bank of England       European Commission Conference: A global approach to sustainable finance    21 March 2019       I am grateful to Jennifer Nemeth for her assistance in drafting these remarks and to Ryan Barrett,   Sarah Breeden, Emma Dalhuijsen, Edd Denbee, Chris Faint, Ronan Hodge and Sini Matikainen for   their input.                                                                                                          1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx   A New Horizon?    A few years ago, I spoke of the Tragedy of the Horizon � how the catastrophic impacts of climate change will   be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most banks, investors and financial policymakers, imposing costs   on future generations that the current one has no direct incentives to fix.1 Once climate change becomes a   clear and present danger to financial stability it could already be too late to stabilise the atmosphere at two   degrees.    The paradox is that risks will ultimately be minimised if the transition to a low-carbon economy begins early   and follows a predictable path. But for markets to anticipate and smooth the transition to a 2-degree world,   they need the right information, proper risk management, and coherent, credible public policy frameworks.    Today, catalysed by the COP21 Paris Agreement, and national policies such as the UK Government�s Clean   Growth Strategy, some of these elements are coming into place, creating a potential path to break the   Tragedy of the Horizon. But the task is large, the window of opportunity is short, and the stakes are   existential.    In pursuit of that New Horizon, let me briefly discuss progress and prospects in three critical areas -   reporting, risk and return.    First, reporting    Three years ago in response to a call from G20 leaders, the FSB began addressing the financial stability   risks associated with climate change by ensuring the market had the right information to price climate risk   and reward climate innovation.    The FSB established the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) led by businesses   from a wide range of industries across the G20. Eighteen months later, the TCFD delivered to the Hamburg   G20 Leaders Summit its recommendations for voluntary disclosures of material climate-related financial   risks.    Since then there has been a step change in both demand and supply of climate reporting.    On the demand side, current supporters of the TCFD include three-quarters of the world�s globally systemic   banks, 8 of the top 10 global asset managers, the world�s leading pension funds and insurers, major credit   rating agencies and the Big Four accounting firms.2 In total, these financial firms manage almost US$110   trillion in assets.       1     Carney, M. (2015). Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon. Available: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2015/breaking-the-   tragedy-of-the-horizon-climate-change-and-financial-stability   2     Full list of current TCFD supporters available on: https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/tcfd-supporters/                                                                                                                                    2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                  2   As a consequence, the incentives for companies to disclose and manage climate-related risks have   increased dramatically. Moreover, climate change claimed its first S&P 500 bankruptcy last year,3 climate-   related shareholder resolutions spiked to 90 last year,4 investment managers controlling over 45% of global   assets under management now back shareholder actions on carbon disclosure, and companies representing   over 90% of all shareholder advisory services now support the TCFD.    Not surprisingly, the supply of disclosure is responding. Over 600 organisations, with a total market   capitalisation of US$9 trillion, have endorsed the TCFD recommendations since 2017.    The TCFD�s September 2018 Implementation Report assessed, using artificial intelligence, some 1800   companies, and analysed in detail an additional 200 of the largest companies, drawn from eight   representative sectors from across the G20.5    In both cohorts, the majority of companies were already disclosing information in their 2017 filings that   aligned with one or more of the TCFD�s recommendations. This is commendable given companies only had   six months to respond to the final TCFD recommendations, but more progress is needed. In particular:        ?   Financial implications are often not yet disclosed;        ?   Disclosures are often in multiple reports making comparisons harder; and        ?   Disclosure varies by industry and region, with higher percentages of European firms and higher           shares of those on the climate frontline � such as the energy sector � disclosing more information           aligned with the recommendations.    The next milestone will be the TCFD implementation report for the G20 Leaders Summit in Osaka, which   should set out:        ?   The growing momentum behind disclosure;        ?   The types of disclosures that are most decision-useful for investors; and        ?   Best practice examples, including examples of scenario analysis so that firms can test their strategic           resilience to different climate outcomes.       3 WSJ. (Jan 2019).

As companies apply the recommendations and investors increasingly differentiate between firms   based on this information, adoption will continue to spread, disclosure will become more decision-useful and   efficient, and its impact will grow.    As firms work to enhance their disclosures, they are being supported by various TCFD Preparers� Forums   from energy to finance.6 The TCFD will also continue to work with market participants to refine metrics so   that they are consistent, comparable and decision-useful; and it will share best practices on the disclosure of   risk management and governance.    In the future, disclosure will move into the mainstream, and it is reasonable to expect that more authorities   will mandate it. IOSCO could play a constructive role in coordinating such mandates and in any event, the   current iterative process of disclosure, reaction and adjustment will be critical to ensure that these eventual   market standards are as comparable, efficient and effective as possible.    Second, risk analysis    The second step on the path to a new horizon is better climate change risk management.    Climate change creates both physical and transition risks.7    Physical risks arise from the increased frequency and severity of climate- and weather-related events that   damage property and disrupt trade.    Transition risks result from the adjustment towards a lower-carbon economy. Changes in policies,   technologies and physical risks will prompt a reassessment of the value of a large range of assets as costs   and opportunities become apparent. The longer meaningful adjustment is delayed, the more transition risks   will rise.    Climate risks also have a number of distinctive elements, which, in combination, require a strategic   approach. These include their:         ?       Breadth, as climate risks affect multiple lines of business, sectors and geographies;         ?       Magnitude, as the full impacts of climate risks are large, potentially non-linear and irreversible;         ?       Foreseeable nature;       6     For example the Oil and Gas industry group convened by the World Business Council on Sustainable Development and the Institute of   International Finance for banks.   7     The other channel concerns liability risks. These stem from parties who have suffered loss from the effects of climate change seeking   compensation from those they hold responsible. Such claims could arise well into the future, as the science and evidence of climate   change hardens, though some are already taking action against companies on the grounds of failure to disclose the risks posed to their   business models by climate change.                                                                                                                                      4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                       4        ?    Dependency on short-term actions given that the size of future impacts will, at least in part, be             determined by the actions taken today; and         ?    Uncertain time horizon which may stretch beyond traditional business planning cycles.    The nature of these risks means that the biggest challenge in climate risk management is in assessing the   resilience of firms� strategies to transition risks.    Part of the genius of the private sector-led TCFD is its recognition that disclosure needs to go beyond the   static to the strategic. Markets need information to assess which companies can seize the opportunities in a   low carbon economy and which are strategically resilient to the physical and transition risks associated with   climate change.    The Bank of England has also become increasingly active in such assessments, consistent with our financial   stability and prudential mandates.    As the supervisor of the world�s fourth largest insurance industry, we know that general insurers and   reinsurers are on the front line of managing the physical risks from climate change. Insurers have responded   by developing their modelling and forecasting capabilities, improving exposure management, and adapting   coverage and pricing.8 In the process, insurers have learned that yesterday�s tail risk is closer to today�s   central scenario.    Sadly with climate, history repeats not as a farce but as tragedy and with growing frequency.    For banks, the financial risks from climate change have tended to be beyond their planning horizons. The   PRA�s survey of 90% of the UK banking sector, representing over $11trn of assets, found that these horizons   averaged four years � in other words, before risks would be expected to be fully realised and prior to   ambitious climate policies taking effect. 9    That notwithstanding, the PRA�s latest survey finds that almost three quarters of banks are starting to treat   the risks from climate change like other financial risks � rather than viewing them simply as a corporate   social responsibility issue.    Banks have begun considering the most immediate physical risks to their business models � from the   exposure of mortgage books to flood risk, to the impact of extreme weather events on sovereign risk. And   they have started to assess exposures to transition risks in anticipation of climate action. This includes   exposures to carbon-intensive sectors, consumer loans secured on diesel vehicles, and buy-to-let lending   given new energy efficiency requirements.    8     Prudential Regulation Authority.

Governance, where firms will be expected to embed fully the consideration of climate risks into             governance frameworks, including at board level, and assign responsibility for oversight of these             risks to specific senior role holders;         ?    Risk management, where firms will need to consider climate change in line with their board-             approved risk appetites;         ?    The regular use of scenario analysis to test strategic resilience; and         ?    Developing and maintaining an appropriate disclosure of climate risks.    Recognising the need for industry to build capacity and to develop best practices, the PRA has established a   Climate Financial Risk Forum, jointly with the FCA, to work with firms from across the financial system.11    The responses to our supervisory consultation reflect the urgency and significance of the issues. Perhaps for   the first time in financial regulation, firms are both thanking their supervisors for raising an issue and pushing   us to go further; with some asking for more prescriptive recommendations and others for mandatory   disclosures.12    Certainly, while climate risk management is improving, there is more to do particularly when assessing   strategic resilience.    For companies, that means conducting scenario analysis.    The TCFD 2018 Status Report found that non-financial industries (energy, transport, building and agriculture)   were the most advanced at measuring strategic resilience, including some examples of scenario   analysis.13,14    The TCFD review found that the financial sector is also moving toward enhanced strategic analysis. For   example half of all insurance companies reviewed used the 2�C scenario, and the majority of banks   described the potential impact of climate-related issues on their businesses.     10      Prudential Regulation Authority.

The materials and building sector also had the highest percentage of companies disclosing information about strategic   resilience and most provided some information on the climate-related scenarios they used to make these assessments.                                                                                                                                       6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                     6   However, the September TCFD report showed that while firms were starting to consider strategic resilience,   few systematically conducted scenario analysis.    Indeed, the PRA has found that despite the sophistication of insurers in modelling climate risks, there are still   gaps in their own risk management. The PRA is increasingly focused on cognitive dissonance in some   insurers whose careful management of climate risks on the liability side of their balance sheets is not always   matched by similar considerations on the asset side.    And the PRA�s banking survey last September found that, although almost three quarters of banks   recognised the risks of climate change, only one in ten were taking a long term, strategic approach to them.    With that in mind, we expect firms to consider scenario analysis as part of their assessments of the impact of   climate risks on their balance sheet and broader business strategy.    An important question is the form these scenarios should take. Climate scenarios aren�t forecasts, but data-   driven narratives that help companies think through different possible futures. The scenarios should be   comprehensive, rigorous and challenging. The assumptions and methodologies in the models � such as the   assumed global temperature rise, the energy mix, or whether the transition happens smoothly or abruptly �   should be sufficiently transparent to allow for comparisons and external challenge. And finally, scenarios   should be implemented consistently across the business, linking identification of risks and opportunities to   both strategy and disclosure.    To do this, firms will need either to develop their own transition scenarios or build on commonly available   models. The TCFD report signposts existing models that firms can use, and the PRA�s Climate Financial   Risk Forum will work with industry to review tools and metrics, with the view to publishing reference   scenarios and standard assumptions.15    For supervisors, assessing strategic resilience will require climate-related stress testing. This involves linking   high-level data-driven narratives on the evolution of physical and transition risks to quantitative metrics to   measure the impact on the financial system.    Next month, the PRA will ask UK insurers, as part of a market-wide insurance stress test, to consider how   their businesses would be affected in different physical and transition risks scenarios.    Testing the banks, and possibly other participants in the financial system, with climate-change scenario   stress tests would have two objectives:       15      The most widely used and well-known are the IEA transition scenarios, which model six different assumed pathways and associated   temperature increases. For modelling physical risks, the IPCC�s four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) fix greenhouse   emissions and analyse the resulting change to the climate.                                                                                                                                   7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                  7        1. To consider whether, across the financial system, financing flows are consistent with an orderly             transition to the climate outcome set out in the Paris agreement. These long-term scenarios can             facilitate discussions between firms and their clients about possible risks across different sectors and             geographies; and         2. To consider whether the financial system would be resilient to shorter-term shocks � including a             climate �Minsky moment� when climate risks materialise suddenly.    These long and short-term risks are, of course, linked � any overall misalignment with climate goals   increases the short-term risks from a disorderly transition, possibly caused by extreme weather events or   abrupt shifts in climate policy. A system-wide stress test can help supervisors and climate policymakers   judge the adequacy of the current transition and whether further actions could be expected.    As the Bank of England considers the timing and design of such a stress test, we are working with   colleagues in the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) to develop a small number of high-   level scenarios.16 And in our Climate Financial Risk Forum we will work with banks, insurers and asset   managers to ensure these scenarios are rolled out effectively within their organisations. Together with our   work on this year�s insurance survey, these initiatives will provide a basis for our future assessments of the   system-wide exposure to climate risks.    The third and final area is return    A new horizon brings new opportunities.    The IEA estimates that the low-carbon transition could require $3.5trn in energy sector investments every   year for decades � twice the rate at present. Under their scenario, in order for carbon to stabilise by 2050,   nearly 95% of electricity supply will need to be low carbon, 70% of new cars electric, and the CO2 intensity of   the building sector will need to fall by 80%.    With an estimated US$90 trillion of infrastructure investment expected between 2015 and 2030, smart   decisions now can make sure that investment is both financially rewarding and environmentally sustainable.       16      The voluntary network was set up by 8 central banks and supervisors in December 2017 at the One Planet Summit, and has since   grown to 29 members, representing countries accounting for nearly half of global emissions, and five observers. It is a voluntary,   consensus-based forum whose purpose is to share best practices, contribute to the development of climate- and environment-related   risk management in the financial sector and mobilize mainstream finance to support the transition toward a sustainable economy. The   analytical work is split into three work streams and the research will be published in April 2019: WS1 microprudential/supervisory; WS2   macrofinancial; and WS3 Scaling up green finance.                                                                                                                                        8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                       8   Regulators and market participants are collaborating to facilitate cross-border investments in green   infrastructure. The European Commission�s Sustainable Finance Action Plan is developing a classification   system for sustainable economic activities, a harmonised green bond standard and methodologies for low-   carbon indices.17 The three major credit rating agencies have all integrated environmental risk and green   certification into credit ratings. And international organisations such as the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) and   International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) have developed definitional frameworks, certification and   validation methods for green financing.18    This work is helping the green bond market to gather pace, with issuance quadrupling from $45bn in 2015 to   $168bn in 2018.19 Last year also saw inaugural sovereign green issues from five countries.20    For investors, green bond markets offer stable, rated and liquid investments with long duration. For issuers,   green bonds are a way to tap the huge US$100 trillion pool of patient private capital managed by global   institutional fixed-income investors. The shift to the capital markets from banks will also free up limited bank   balance sheet capacity for early-stage project financing and infrastructure lending.    Over the last two years, the City of London has been glowing green with sixteen renewable infrastructure   funds with a value of $7bn listed on the LSE. The City has been the centre of a series of landmark global   green bond issuances, from China�s first Green Covered Bond � the country�s first ever international   issuance of a green bond � to the first green Masala Bond worth INR 20bn. In our view, such local currency   green bonds will be particularly important to the climate transition in emerging market economies (EMEs).    However, while they are important catalysts, green bonds will not be sufficient to finance the transition to a   low carbon future. They accounted for only 3% of global bond issuance in 2018.    Achieving the transition will require mobilising mainstream finance.    Advances in reporting and risk analysis are paving the way for investors to realise the opportunities in   climate-friendly investment by re-orienting their focus to broader, more sustainable long-term value creation.    Such investment approaches are becoming increasingly common. There are now almost 2000 signatories,   with over $80 trillion in assets under management, to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UN   PRI), an international network of investors committed to considering ESG factors in their work.21    This swell of support is driven by the expectation that sustainable investment can generate excess returns in   three ways.     17      For more information on the Commission�s Sustainable Plan, see: https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-   finance/sustainable-finance_en   18      See: CBI https://www.climatebonds.net/about and ICMA https://www.icmagroup.org/green-social-and-sustainability-bonds/green-   bond-principles-gbp/   19      Climate Bonds Initiative.

This makes them more strategically resilient and therefore able to anticipate, and adapt to, the   risks and opportunities on the horizon, generating true alpha from ESG.    Second, strong ESG scores could signal that a firm is more naturally disposed to longer-term strategic   thinking and planning. Climate disclosure is increasingly seen not only as necessary in and of itself, but also   as informative about the extent to which companies are focused on long-term value creation.    And third, strong ESG firms may enjoy valuation premiums consistent with shifting investor preferences.   Millennials, keenly focused on company values and sustainability, are set to inherit $24trn of wealth in the   US alone over the next 15 years and will seek the investment opportunities to match.22 Already, assets are   moving to ESG strategies at 20 per cent annual growth.23    A review of over 200 sources on ESG performance by Oxford University and Arabesque showed that in the   overwhelming majority (88%) of companies that focused on sustainability, operational performance was   improved, translating to higher cash flows.24    And meta-analysis of over 2000 studies confirms that the responsible, as well as the economic case for ESG   investment is tangible. 90% of studies find that there is no penalty on return on ESG investment, and the   majority suggest that focusing on ESG criteria generates a positive return.25    The outperformance of strong ESG companies is uncorrelated with underlying factors such as return on   equity or capital employed, and reflects greater earnings stability and lower share price volatility. While   �screening� - excluding poor ESG performers - is still the most common tool among investors, some research   finds that a more proactive consideration of ESG factors may pay off. 26,27, 28    �Tilt� strategies, which overweight ESG stocks, and �momentum� strategies, which focus on companies that   have improved their ESG rating, have outperformed global benchmarks for close to a decade.29      22      Deloitte.

Given this growing track record, companies are developing ways to better score ESG performance and   invest accordingly. For example, Arabesque uses machine learning models to assess the performance and   sustainability of companies, and stock selection strategies to tailor portfolios to a wide range of investor ESG   preferences. This week BNY Mellon adopted such an approach motivated in part by the EU�s Directive on   Pensions (IORP II).30 Earlier this year UBS launched a pilot project that will allow investors to rate how much   weight they want to place on different ESG factors.31 And last month, BlackRock launched six new Exchange   Traded Funds (ETFs) that combine an ESG uplift and a 30% reduction in carbon emissions.32 These   sustainable building blocks can be substituted into many traditional portfolios, improving ESG scores and   reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity without sacrificing performance.    In the future, climate and ESG considerations will likely be at the heart of mainstream investing. Investors will   tailor their investments and fulfil their fiduciary duties through: better quality and more widely available data   on sustainability and performance; superior data analytics through the advent of AI and Machine Learning;   and more informed judgements of strategic resilience.

2019-03-28	"Investing in Ethnicity & Race    Speech given by   Mark Carney, Governor Bank of England     Investing in Ethnicity & Race Conference 2019, Bank of England   28 March 2019                                                                                                             1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx   Introduction     It�s a pleasure for the Bank of England to host this workshop on Investing in Ethnicity & Race.     To pursue its mission, Bank of England must reflect the diversity of the people it serves.     That hasn�t always been the case. Historically, central banks were run by the City for the City. The Bank�s   first female Court member, Frances Heaton, was appointed only in 1993, while our first Black, Asian and   Minority Ethnic (BAME) member, Lord Morris, followed five years later. I�m the 120th in a very long line of   male, white Governors of the Bank.     Over the last five years the Bank has implemented a concerted strategy to increase diversity and foster   inclusion. These initiatives have had a material impact on all aspects of diversity at the Bank. We are now   reinforcing them to further improve the retention and progression of BAME colleagues in particular, and to   deepen progress on inclusion more generally.     The Bank values diversity for at least three reasons.     First, it is the right thing to do: a public institution should reflect the public it serves.     Second, diversity helps to build the trust we need to fulfil our remits.     The decisions that the Bank takes impact every UK citizen, but not everyone wants to be steeped in fan   charts and stress testing.     The conventional central banker approach is to build trust through a track record. In recent decades this has   been supplemented by greater transparency. But trust is also grounded in familiarity. People trust   individuals, places and things that they know.     Better reflecting the diversity of the people we serve can reduce misperceptions that we are experts making   esoteric decisions in an ivory tower for the benefit of others. Broader outreach to all strata of society across   the country can reinforce these benefits.     Diversity can make our communication more effective. Homogenous organisations are more likely to fall   afoul of the �curse of knowledge�, where people assume that their audience has the same information and   base level of understanding as themselves. By drawing on alternative perspectives, we can craft our   messages so that they resonate with more people.                                                                                                                     2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                2   Third, greater diversity leads to better decision making.     Homogenous groups are vulnerable to over-optimism, bias and groupthink. They easily become rigid.   In contrast, diverse teams can adapt better to change. Such resilience is particularly important in a world   where information is super abundant and certainty is absent, and it is especially relevant in finance where   most decisions are taken under uncertainty.     But diversity alone is insufficient. For its benefits to be realised fully, diverse teams must be supported by   the right frameworks. Research on central bank committee design shows that diverse decision?making   bodies benefit from:       ?   Having a clearly defined policy objective;       ?   Having relatively small policy committees, with external members;       ?   Publishing policy decisions, and;       ?   Allowing for external scrutiny.     How the Bank of England is becoming more diverse     Five years ago we made Diverse and Talented one of four pillars of our strategic plan. Our aim was not just   to increase diversity; but also to choose inclusion.     Inclusion unlocks the true value of an organisation�s diversity. Only through inclusion can people realise their   full potential. That�s why the Bank is focussing on building a culture that values diverse ideas, encourages   open debate, and empowers people at all levels to take initiative.     Our strategy has three elements:       ?   Inclusive recruitment,       ?   Inclusive culture, and       ?   Inclusive communications.     First, inclusive recruitment    We are fishing from a larger pond. In recent years our graduates have come from 40 different universities, a   six-fold increase in the past decade. Of our 2019 intake, due to join us in September, 46% of graduates are   female and 39% are declared BAME students. This compares to a BAME share of 20% five years ago.     To support diverse recruitment at all levels our managers are now required to undertake unconscious bias   training. We use anonymous CVs for internal and external recruitment and strive for balanced shortlists and   interview panels.                                                                                                                       3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                  3   In 2016 we setup a formalised talent management process for all employees, to ensure everyone has equal   access to opportunities to discuss their careers.     To enable us to continue to hire graduates from a broader set of disciplines and train them as economists   and technical specialists we have introduced our Central Banking Qualification, in which new hires can earn   Masters Degrees in Central Banking. And now around half of our graduates study economics, with the   remainder plucked from the sciences, business and the humanities.     To help develop the next generation, we are working with schools and universities to encourage a more   diverse set of students to study economics and finance. We provide free classroom materials through our   econoME initiative, and by the end of 2018 one quarter of all state secondary schools had registered for the   programme, reaching an audience of 90,000 students. Over the past year we have made more than 300   school visits, of which 75 were by the Bank's committee members, including myself.     Second, fostering an inclusive culture     As we attract a more diverse workforce, we�re taking a number of initiatives to enable and encourage   participation.     Traditionally central banks have been notoriously hierarchical and deferential. To break down these barriers,   we have changed how we make decisions to ensure that everyone participating has the same information at   the same time, and can put forth their views. We have an �author in the room� policy so that expert staff can   always explain their papers in person and challenge conventional wisdom.     Our core values (which include being Inclusive and Collaborative) are embedded in everything that we do,   including feeding directly into the performance management and remuneration of all colleagues.     We are proud to have a number of thriving and influential employee network groups including Women in the   Bank, LGBT+ and Allies, Bank of England Ethnic Minority (BEEM), Mental Health, Disability, Carers,   Parents, and three Faith Networks. The Employee Network Groups help Bank colleagues bring their whole   selves to work. I will talk more in a moment about the important work our BEEM network does to support   BAME colleagues.     Third, inclusive communications     Inclusion also means engaging with all our stakeholders, internal and external, and being aware of the many   ways in which the economic situation affects different people. Active engagement with a range of expert and   non-expert stakeholders across the UK has always been important, but it is taking on new prominence in the   information age.                                                                                                                4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx             4   Our agents and Bank officials meet thousands of business contacts across the UK each year to take the   temperature of the UK economy.     Our new Open Forum and Future Forum events do this on a large scale by bringing together thousands of   people from the community to discuss the economy, the financial system and the Bank�s role in promoting   the good of the people of the United Kingdom. We listen to the views and concerns of local business   leaders, technology developers, representatives from the voluntary and education sectors, unions and the   wider public and explore how the Bank can maintain stability and reduce uncertainty.     Inclusive communications also requires more tailored content. Our visual summaries of our Inflation and the   Financial Stability Reports, explain how developments in the global economy and financial system affect the   outlook for inflation and financial stability without the need for dense text. Deploying social media, including   Facebook and YouTube, can make our messages available directly to a broader audience. New digital   products, such as KnowledgeBank, use accessible language and engaging visuals to help us tell a story   about what the Bank does.     Our strategy is working, with major progress over the past five years.     For example, female representation in senior roles at the Bank has increased from 17% in 2013 to 31%   today, and is on track for our target of 35% by the end of 2020.1     BAME representation below senior management is 19%, up from 13% in 2013.     In 2018 we were one of the first organisations to conduct a special Cognitive Diversity Survey. Our results   indicate colleagues are generally positive about inclusiveness at the Bank on every metric measured.     In 2018 we were one of the first organisations to conduct a special Cognitive Diversity Survey to gain a better   understanding of how our colleagues feel about working at the Bank. The survey measured seven inclusivity   metrics including interpersonal interactions, flexible working, communication with leaders as well as   recruitment and promotion, and results are cut across twelve different aspects of diversity. Our results   indicate colleagues are generally positive about inclusiveness at the Bank on every metric measured by the   survey.     And 80% of colleagues in our annual employee survey reported they think the Bank takes diversity seriously,   7 percentage points higher than the UK average. And 87% of Bank colleagues say they are treated with   respect as an individual, 6 percentage points higher than the UK average.     1       See also my letter to Nicky Morgan, Chair of the Treasury Select Committee, on 4 July 2018.                                                                                                                 5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                5   Let me now turn specifically to ethnic diversity at the Bank.     Investing in ethnicity2     Our diversity and inclusion strategy has had a positive impact on BAME diversity at the Bank of England.   Since we implemented name-blind recruitment processes in March 2018 around one quarter of all   recruitment offers (internal and external) have been to declared BAME candidates. But there is scope for   further improvement.     The turnover rate of declared BAME colleagues is higher than that for the Bank as a whole � 9.2% compared   with 7.5% as of January 2019. While BAME representation at senior levels has increased from 2% to 5%   since 2013, we still have some way to go to meet our ambitious target of 13% by 2022.     The Bank�s experience is consistent with that of other organisations as documented by �The Middle� (a   thorough, evidence-based research report on progressing BAME Talent in the Workplace commissioned by   the Black British Business Awards).3 This study concluded that across organisations the challenges were   greatest in retaining and promoting ethnic minority professionals from middle management to senior   executive roles. We�re pleased that the changes the Bank is already making are consistent with the report�s   recommendations.     To maintain momentum, the Bank recently created a BAME Diversity Taskforce, chaired by Deputy Governor   Sir Dave Ramsden and attended by members of both Court and our BEEM network. This Taskforce is now   focusing on:     First, supporting the progression of BAME colleagues to leadership roles by rolling out inclusive   leadership training for all colleagues and having all senior management including the Bank�s Governors   participate in our Sponsorship programmes and mentoring schemes.     Second, supporting our ethnic minorities network (BEEM), which has achieved much since its   foundation in 2012. This includes implementing reciprocal mentoring of 150 of our BAME colleagues each   year. BEEM has also set up, with HR, the Bank's African/ African-Caribbean scholarship programme.   Launched in 2015, we have awarded 10 scholarships and 8 bursaries to talented students studying a range   of subjects from Chemical Engineering to Politics and International Relations.       2    See also my letter to Nicky Morgan, Chair of the Treasury Select Committee, on 19 March 2019.   3    See �Progressing Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) talent in the workplace through collaborative action�, �The Middle� Report,   available online at: https://www.thebbbawards.com/middle-research/                                                                                                                                      6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                     6   We have recently decided to provide a seat at the table for our BEEM network at senior committees   whenever diversity issues are discussed. And we have launched �Let�s Talk About Race� workshops to help   senior leaders become more comfortable talking about these issues.     Third, we are ensuring greater accountability for BAME progression throughout the organisation.     The Bank has published a huge amount of diversity data externally and internally since we first set diversity   targets five years ago. We published our BAME pay gap for the first time in our 2018 Annual Report. We are   currently reviewing the metrics we report to make sure they identify hotspots in terms of BAME recruitment,   progression or retention.     All managers� participation in the inclusion agenda is assessed as part of annual performance reviews, and   Executive Directors have specific diversity performance objectives.     Finally, I am very pleased to announce today that the Bank is signing the Race at Work charter. This Charter   commits organisations to five initiatives to improve ethnic diversity in the workplace. The Bank now has all   five in place.4     Conclusion     Choosing inclusion means listening and learning from others. That�s why it is so valuable to have forums like   today.     We are fortunate to have with us this morning representatives of so many organisations who have   championed diversity and inclusion for many years.

2019-04-30	"A Platform for Innovation   Speech given by   Mark Carney, Governor Bank of England     Remarks at Innovate Finance Global Summit, London   Monday 29 April 2019       I am grateful to Eleanor Connolly and Jen Nemeth for their assistance in preparing these and to   John Jackson, Richard Lewis, Tom Mutton and Oliver Thew for background research and analysis.         1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx   Introduction     A century ago, John Maynard Keynes resigned as a delegate to the Paris Peace Conference over his   concerns about the scale of reparations in what would become the Treaty of Versailles.     He returned home to write The Economic Consequences of the Peace. In that seminal work, Keynes   marvelled that before the war:             �The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various           products of the whole earth� [or] adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises           of any quarter of the world that fancy or information might recommend.�     Such global trade and portfolio management were made possible by new technologies ranging from the   telegraph to the first transatlantic cable.     Replace �telephone� with �tablet� and �tea� with �turmeric latte� and you have not the start of the Twentieth   Century but of the Twenty First. The second great wave of globalisation is cresting. The Fourth Industrial   Revolution is just beginning. And a new economy is emerging driven by immense changes in technology,   the reordering of global economic power, and the growing pressures of climate change.     New Economy � New Finance     A new economy requires a new finance. A new finance to serve the digital economy, a new finance to   support the major transitions underway across the globe and a new finance to increase the sector�s   resilience.     A new finance with products that are more cost effective, better tailored, and more inclusive.     The UK�s FinTech companies are creating this new finance. We have just heard from Charlotte Crosswell of   Innovate Finance how the UK FinTech sector leads in talent, drive and investment.     But you cannot do it all on your own.     Your efforts will be even more effective if you have the right conditions in which to innovate and the level   playing fields on which to compete.     New Finance - New Bank     That�s why a new finance demands a new Bank of England.                                                                                                                    2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                 2   In this spirit, last year at Mansion House, I announced that Huw van Steenis would lead a review of the future   of the UK financial system, including recommendations for how the Bank should respond. In two months,   Huw will publish his conclusions and the Bank will announce a number of concrete steps to create an   environment for a more resilient, effective and efficient financial system.     To preview our general approach I want to highlight some recent measures the Bank has been taking.   The Bank�s strategy is to enable innovation and empower competition, while ensuring monetary and financial   stability.    Our levers are the hard and soft infrastructure we control:       ?      Hard infrastructure, such as the Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, which lies at the heart              of the UK payment system.       ?      And soft infrastructure, such as our rules, regulations and standards.     To illustrate what this means in practice, consider three examples of how the new Bank can provide a   platform for private innovation to serve the digital economy, to finance major transitions, and to increase the   resilience of the financial system.     Serving the Digital Economy     First, at the heart of the new economy, the very nature of commerce is changing. Last year, one fifth of all   sales in the UK were online. Next year, it will be one quarter. The new economy is more inclusive, offering   easier routes to market for firms both large and small, and greater access for consumers both near and far.   We are entering an age when anyone can produce anything, anywhere and sell everywhere through   platforms such as Tmall, Amazon, Shopify and YouTube.     This new digital economy is placing new demands on finance. Consumers and businesses increasingly   expect transactions to be settled in real time, checkout to become an historical anomaly, and payments   across borders to be indistinguishable from those across the street.     In parallel, big data is opening up new opportunities for more competitive, platform-based finance of SMEs.   Search and social media data are supplementing traditional metrics to unlock finance for smaller enterprises   whose assets are increasingly intangible.     This new finance demands a Bank of England that is as open to new providers as it has been to traditional   players.                                                                                                                      3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                3   Here�s one way we are changing our hard infrastructure in response. The Bank is in the midst of an   ambitious rebuild of RTGS1, which processes over �600 billion of payments every day. Until recently only   commercial banks had direct access to it, and alternative payment service providers (or PSPs) had to route   through them. That made sense in the old financial world arranged around a series of hubs and spokes but   it is increasingly anachronistic in the new, distributed finance that is emerging.     So we are now making it easier for a broad set of firms to plug in and compete with more traditional   providers. Responding to demands from FinTech providers, the rebuild will provide API access to read and   write payment data.     In July 2017, we became the first G20 central bank to open up access to our payment services to a new   generation of non-bank PSPs. Since then, five have become members and there is a growing pipeline of   around twenty firms exploring whether and how to join. Wider access will improve services to UK   households and businesses and it will bring financial stability benefits by increasing the proportion of   settlement in central bank money, diversifying the number of settlement firms, and driving innovation.     Financing Major Transitions     My second example of how the Bank is providing a platform for private innovation concerns the financing of   the major transitions shaping the new economy such as the rapid rise of emerging economic powers and the   evolving response to climate change.     The transition to a low carbon economy, in particular, will require enormous re-allocations of capital and   massive investments in infrastructure�on some estimates as much as $100 trillion globally over the next   decade. Firms that anticipate these developments will be rewarded handsomely; those that fail to adapt will   cease to exist. This will have enormous ramifications both the financial system and for financial stability.2     That�s why the Bank is transforming our soft infrastructure.     Recognising the need for adequate reporting of climate-related risks and opportunities, four years ago the   Bank helped catalyse the private sector-led Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).   The TCFD has now led to a step change in the demand and supply of climate reporting. With over $100   trillion in assets now demanding TCFD quality disclosures, a market in transition is now being built.       1     RTGS Renewal Programme: A blueprint for a new RTGS service for the United Kingdom.

Earlier this month we published a Supervisory   Statement and Policy Statement3 that together set out our expectations for banks and insurers regarding   their governance, risk management, strategic resilience and disclosure of climate-related financial risks.   To support the capacity building and the development of best practice, the PRA has just established the   Climate Financial Risk Forum to work with firms from across the financial system.     The Bank of England is also working with central bank and supervisory colleagues from around the world in   the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) to improve climate risk management in the core of   the global financial system. Our priorities include the development of a small number of high-level climate   scenarios that can be used in future system-wide stress tests.4 Next month, the PRA will require insurers, as   part of market-wide stress tests, to consider how their businesses would be affected in different climate risk   scenarios.     By adapting our soft infrastructure in these ways, the Bank will help ensure that the financial system is not   only resilient to climate-related risks but also can take full advantage of the enormous opportunities in a new   low carbon economy.     Applying New Technologies to Increase Resilience     My final example of how the Bank is building a platform for FinTech innovation, considers how general   purpose technologies, including advanced analytics such as AI, can increase the resilience of the financial   system.     As much of life moves online, a trail of data is created. Indeed, more data was created in the past two years   than in all the years that came before.5 And this data is creating enormous opportunities for the new finance   to serve customers better and to manage risks more effectively.     To those ends, the financial sector is investing heavily in the Cloud, Machine Learning and AI. Banking is   already the second biggest global spender on AI systems (after retail) and is expected to invest a further   $10bn on AI by 2020. AI-enabled solutions are increasingly important in fraud detection as well as   automated threat intelligence and prevention. As some in the audience are exploring, there is also   significant potential in credit assessments, wholesale loan underwriting and trading.     As my colleague James Proudman recently described, such advanced analytics are also likely to lead to   changes to the way the Bank conducts supervision.6     3     Supervisory Statement 3/19.

As a process, it   can be broken down into three simple steps:       1) rule-setting and reporting;       2) analysis and monitoring; and       3) setting and communicating a supervisory strategy to mitigate identified risks.     Each of these aspects of supervision is amenable to automation, machine learning or AI to some extent.   Consider rule setting and reporting.     At over 638,000 words, the PRA Rule Book is longer than War and Peace. It is also somewhat less   interesting and infinitely more complex.     We are currently using advanced analytics to understand the complexity and interconnectedness of the PRA   rulebook, to identify ways to simplify our rules, and to make compliance with them easier for firms.     And to explore ways to make reporting more efficient and effective, we are running a Digital Regulatory   Reporting pilot, with the FCA, on machine readable reporting requirements that firms� systems could interpret   and ultimately automate regulatory data collection.     These initiatives are goods in and of themselves, but they also create the potential to unlock the power of AI   in order to improve the quality of our supervision.    Conclusion     When Keynes marvelled at new possibilities, a decade of wealth creation would follow, but its gains gave rise   to imbalances in incomes and in trade. When combined with the Economic Consequences of the Peace,   disaster ensued.     Today, new technologies, the new economy and the new finance have the potential to unlock more   sustainable and inclusive growth. Consumers can have greater choice and better-targeted services; small   and medium sized businesses can access new credit to grow; banks themselves can become more   productive, and the financial system overall can become more resilient.     Most fundamentally, unlike in Keynes� time, the gains from new technologies will not be limited to men or   captured by denizens of the City.      6    Proudman, J (2018) Cyborg Supervision.

I would like to speak today about your raison d�etre: sustainable cross border  capital flows.   Capital flows can be an enormous force for good. For example, when my native Canada was an emerging  economy, net capital inflows averaged 10% of GDP every year for around three decades.   But the recent history of capital flows is more chequered.   After all, the IIF was founded 36 years ago in response to the Latin American debt crisis. That crisis was the  product of an initially well founded and productive � but ultimately over exuberant and destructive � recycling  of petro dollars by the banking system.   That period provided painful examples both of how capital flows can support development and how capital  flow volatility can undermine it.   The Asian crisis almost 15 years later underscored the risks of relying on inflows that look stable but prove  ephemeral. And subsequent crises in Latin America around the turn of the millennium and in advanced  economies (AEs) a decade ago reinforced the risks of taking capital flows for granted.   In theory, foreign capital inflows should support growth through greater allocative efficiency, better risk sharing  and increased technology transfer.   But in reality financial openness has proven a double-edged sword. The typical emerging market economy  (EME) receiving higher capital inflows will grow 0.3 percentage points faster, all else equal (Chart 1). But the  typical EME with higher capital flow volatility will grow 0.7 percentage points slower (Chart 2).1   Charts 1 and 2: Financial openness is a double-edged sword                                                                     9                                                                             9                                                                    8                                                                             8                                                                                                                                                      Real GDP growth (%)                                                                        Real GDP growth (%)                                                                        7                                                                             7                                                                    6                                                                             6                                                                    5                                                                             5                                                                    4                                                                             4                                                                    3                                                                             3                                                                    2                                                                             2                                                                    1                                                                             1                                                                    0                                                                             0    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15                                                     0.4   0.6   0.8    1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6      1.8   2.0            Capital flows as % GDP                                                                              Volatility of flows  Source: IMF.

And more generally,  financial openness has tended to amplify domestic imbalances and leave EMEs more vulnerable to foreign  shocks.2   As a consequence, a fifth of all surges in capital flows to EMEs have ended in financial crises. And EMEs are  at least three times more likely to experience a financial crisis after capital flow surges than in normal times. 3   Chart 3: Net private capital flows to emerging market economies and incidences of crises          % of GDP                               Number of EM crises (rhs)                                                       Number         6                                     Net private capital flows to Non-China EMEs (lhs)                                    6          5                         Crises tend to occur                                                                                                                                        5                                   when capital flows slow         4                                                                                                                                        4         3                                                                                                                                        3         2                                                                                                                                        2         1          0                                                                                                                              1         -1                                                                                                                              0              1980         1985           1990            1995           2000           2005            2010           2015   Source: IMF.

Surges are defined as a net capital   flow observation that lie in the top thirtieth percentile of both the country-specific and the full sample�s distribution of net capital flows,   expressed in percent of GDP.                                                                                                                                                3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                               3  Given the uncertainty over the sustainability of capital inflows, EMEs have defensively accumulated reserves  and limited the opening of their capital accounts, including by resorting to overt capital flow management in  some cases. Overall, EMEs have increased their financial openness by considerably less than advanced  economies (AEs) since 1980, leaving their external balance sheets only around a third the size of those in  AEs, despite much faster growth in external trade (Chart 4).   These responses, while understandable, carry significant opportunity costs. Excess precautionary savings in  EMEs are pushing down equilibrium interest rates, increasing the risks of a global liquidity trap. And  enormous cross border flows will be required to close EME infrastructure investment gaps and to finance the  essential transition to a low carbon economy.   Today, I want to examine what drives capital flow volatility and, in the process, sketch an agenda for  sustainable capital flows in the new world order.   Specifically, what should be the priorities to increase sustainable cross border capital flows? How many are  the responsibility of the receiving country? What about the advanced economies who set the tone for the  global financial cycle? And to what extent does the structure of the international monetary financial system  itself, including the global safety net, determine safe flows?   To begin to answer these questions, the Bank of England is developing a holistic �Capital Flows-at-Risk�  framework that assesses the relative contribution of the three drivers of Capital Flows-at-Risk:4   ?       �Pull factors� � domestic conditions and institutions that affect the relative attractiveness of investing in an          individual country.  ?       �Push factors� � that determine global risk appetite and financial conditions, particularly the level and          prospects for US monetary policy and financial stability.  ?       �The Pipes� � the structure of the global financial system itself, particularly the degree to which it dampens          or amplifies shocks.          4        This builds on early work by the IMF presented in the October 2018 Global Financial Stability Report relating to portfolio flows. More      details on the Bank of England work will be forthcoming in a Working Paper.                                                                                                                                              4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                           4  Chart 5: The distribution of capital flows to emerging market economies                 Unconditional distribution             Negative shock                                    Probability density                                                                                                                      0.10                                                                                                                          0.08                                                                                                                          0.06                                                                                                                          0.04                       B          A                                                                                                                        0.02                                                                                                                          0.00        -8        -6       -4    -2       0       2       4       6        8      10       12      14      16      18        Capital flows as a % of GDP    Sources: IMF and Bank of England staff calculations.  Notes: This chart shows the unconditional distribution of capital flows to EMEs over 2006-2018, and an estimated  distribution conditional on a one standard deviation negative shock to pull factors. The diamonds highlight the fifth  percentile, which is our preferred measure of Capital Flows-at-Risk. We estimate several quantiles of the distribution  through quantile regression and then fit a skewed-t distribution; hence, the distribution can both shift and change shape  in response to shocks - see annex for further details.    The grey line in Chart 5 shows the unconditional distribution of capital flows, and the purple line shows how  the distribution shifts in response to a negative shock. �Capital Flows-at-Risk� are defined as capital outflows  in a severe, low-probability event (that with 5% probability or less). The left tail �fattens� if bad outcomes  become more likely and/or the �5% probability event� becomes more severe � shown by the shift from A  (Capital Flows-at-Risk of 1.2% of GDP) to B (Capital Flows-at-Risk of 4.2% of GDP).   The Bank�s framework can be used to assess policy options and associated trade-offs, and to communicate  policy decisions.   Today, I will provide some tentative conclusions in order to spur further debate and analysis, including as part  of the IMF�s work on its �Integrated Policy Framework� and the G20 discussions on the future of the financial  architecture.   Our core finding is that the distribution of capital flows will shift and change shape when there is a change in  any of the three drivers � pull, push or pipes.5 In an interdependent world, everyone � advanced economies,     5 The Capital Flows-at-Risk model presented in chart 6 does not explicitly model �the pipes�. The impact of augmenting   the framework with pipes is shown later on in charts [15 and 16].                                                                                                                               5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                            5  emerging economies as well as the public and private sectors � is responsible for reducing capital flow  volatility and increasing sustainable capital flows in order to meet the challenges of our age.   Turning to the three drivers in more detail.   Pull factors   The conventional wisdom, prior to the financial crisis, was that the best contribution each country can do for  itself and others would be to �keep its own house in order�.6   The foundations of that house are:        ?   Credible inflation targeting regimes. Credible domestic frameworks for implementing monetary policy           � with an operationally independent and accountable central bank at their core � have generally           delivered inflation rates that are both lower and less variable. 7 This directly benefits all citizens in           good times. Moreover, greater monetary policy credibility gives a central bank more scope to respond           to shocks, and enables financial markets to anticipate better the path for monetary policy, thereby           providing a stabilising force during bad times. During the taper tantrum, those economies with better-           anchored inflation expectations were able to keep monetary policy relatively more accommodative. 8        ?   Flexible exchange rates. A flexible exchange rate acts as a valuable shock absorber for an economy           because domestic wages and prices are relatively �sticky� (in other words, slow to adjust). For           example, suppose there is a spike in global risk aversion. As capital flows are withdrawn flexible           exchange rates depreciate. In general, this boosts an economy�s competitiveness. However, where           economies borrow heavily in foreign currency, and this exposure is unhedged, depreciations can be           detrimental for the economy. 9        ?   Fiscal sustainability. A sustainable fiscal position provides governments with more room to respond to           adverse shocks to demand. Financial markets therefore reward more sustainable fiscal positions: the           IMF found that declines in inflows between 2010 and 2015 were 1 percentage points of GDP larger for           countries with above-average public debt ratios.10 Fiscal sustainability is also necessary for a credible           nominal anchor.       6      Fischer, S (1988), International Macroeconomic Policy Coordination, in International Economic Cooperation, ed. by Martin Feldstein,   Chicago: University of Chicago Press.   7     Rose (2007), A stable international monetary system emerges: Inflation targeting is Bretton Woods, reversed, Journal of International   Money and Finance, Elsevier, vol. 26(5), pages 663-681, September.   8      See Chapter 3 of the October 2018 IMF World Economic Outlook.   9     Cesa-Bianchi et al (2015), Global Liquidity, House Prices, and the Macroeconomy: Evidence from Advanced and Emerging Economies,   Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, show that for AEs flexible exchange rates dampen the impact of push shocks, whereas for EMs   they can amplify the impact of push shocks via a collateral valuation effect   10       See Chapter 2, IMF April 2016 World Economic Outlook.                                                                                                                                      6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                       6        ?   An effective macroprudential policy toolkit to curtail the damaging extremes of domestic financial            cycles. Macroprudential policy can guard against rapid credit growth, which is amongst the best early            warning indicators of an impending downturn. 11 And higher domestic bank capital ratios reduce the            sensitivity of capital inflows to changes in global volatility.12          ?   And deep domestic capital markets to reduce the reliance on foreign investors and the need to issue            in foreign currency, which dampens capital flow volatility (Chart 6).

Notes: The grey bars on this chart show the unconditional 5th percentile of the distribution of capital flows in a panel   of 13 EMEs since 1996. The purple bars build on the contribution of pull factors to the conditional 5th percentile of   capital flows in the current quarter and two quarters ahead. Pull factors are proxied by domestic financial condition   indices (DFCIs), which are mean-orthogonalised by a global financial conditions index (GFCI). The coefficient on the   DFCIs is estimated by panel quantile regressions. The chart shows PPP-weighted averages across the 13 EMEs in   our panel. See Annex for further details.    The Bank of England�s analysis finds that the conventional prescription to concentrate on putting one�s own  house in order had merit: pull factors were the main drivers of capital flow instability prior to the 2008 crisis  (Chart 7). Over the years, this advice has been taken to heart.13   80% of EMEs are now inflation-targeters, compared to none just prior to the Asian Financial Crisis. These  regimes have generally been successful: inflation has been low and stable across EMEs since the mid-2000s  at a median rate of 2.5%, close to the rate in AEs. In many respects, the exceptions such as Argentina and  Turkey prove the norm.   Fiscal policy is more of a mixed picture; debt ratios are lower than in advanced economies but fiscal deficits  have widened materially in recent years.   In general, the resilience of emerging economy banking systems has increased with implementation of most of  the FSB post-crisis reforms on track. EMEs are the most active users of macroprudential policy.     13     In the model pull factors are proxied by domestic financial conditions (mean-orthogonalised by global financial conditions), which   encompass market views about domestic institutional frameworks.                                                                                                                                                      8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                                                  8  However, while there has been progress in developing domestic capital markets � the depth of EME financial  markets has doubled since the turn of millennium � this has been insufficient to meet rising financing needs.  As a result, the share of FX-denominated debt has increased sharply (Chart 8).   And while domestic markets have deepened, the share of foreign ownership in EME local currency bond  markets has risen, up from 5% on average pre-crisis to around 25% today.

Despite these vulnerabilities, the Bank�s analysis finds that, for EMEs as a whole, reforms to domestic  institutional �pull factors� have substantially increased the sustainability of capital flows and so shifted the  distribution of capital flows to the right (Chart 9), all else equal.                                                                                                                         9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/speeches                                                   9  Chart 9: Pull factors have reduced Capital Flows-at-Risk for EMEs since the Asian Financial Crisis                                                                                                          Probabilty density                                                                                                                      0.12                                                                                                                       0.10                                                                                                                       0.08                                                                                                                       0.06                                     B                                                                                 0.04                        A                                                                                                                      0.02                                                                                                                       0.00         -8    -6     -4      -2       0       2       4       6       8       10      12      14      16      18        Capital flows as a % of GDP                                         2008-2018                                        Post-2008 crisis             Asian Financial Crisis  Sources: IMF and Bank staff calcluations.  Notes: Chart shows the contribution of pull factors to capital flows to EMEs during the Asian Financial Crisis (purple),  and since 2008 (green). In both distributions push factors are held at their sample average, so only pull factors are  changing. See chart 5 and annex for further details.   Push factors   Unfortunately for EMEs, all else has not been equal. The importance of �push factors� has increased over time  as monetary policy and financial stability shocks in advanced economies have become both more prevalent  and more potent.   And push factors are arguably becoming more important as the fundamental asymmetry at the heart of the  global economy deepens.   When the IIF was founded, EMEs made up a little more than 1/3 of global GDP. Since the last Fed tightening  cycle, their share of global activity has risen from around 45% to 60%. By 2030, it is projected to rise to  around three quarters.   But while the real global economy is being reordered, the international monetary financial system has barely  begun its transition. The dollar represents the currency of choice for at least half of international trade  invoices, two-thirds of global securities issuance, it denominates two-thirds of EME foreign currency external  debt and acts as the monetary anchor in countries accounting for 70% of global GDP.14       14    Gopinath, Gita, and Jeremy C.

Indeed, our research suggests that the influence of US financial conditions on foreign GDP has  increased by a third relative to its average from 1990 to 2005, despite the US�s rapidly declining share of  global GDP.

2019-06-17	"Finance by all, for all   Speech given by   Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England     Remarks at Women in Banking and Finance 22nd Annual Awards, London   Friday 14 June 2019       I am grateful to Jennifer Nemeth for her assistance in preparing these remarks, and to Jenny Pye,   Katie Williamson and Paul Wright for their help with background research and analysis.                                                                                                        1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches   It is an honour to join you today to celebrate this special occasion.    The Women In Banking and Finance (WIBF) network is a place to connect with colleagues, share knowledge   and like today, celebrate success.    In that spirit we have already connected at the reception and will conclude by celebrating your success, so   let me take up a bit of the middle to share some knowledge that the Bank has gained as it seeks to improve   diversity and inclusion at the heart of finance.    Let me start by reflecting on the state of the UK financial services industry. Over two million people across   the UK work in the sector. It makes up over 10% of the economy and runs a trade surplus of �72 billion,   greater than all other exporting industries combined. Financial services contribute enough taxes to fund the   NHS.1    Most fundamentally, finance serves households and businesses at home and abroad. Last year, the UK   financial system channelled �300 billion in finance to UK businesses and helped 700,000 households to   purchase homes. Finance insures the contents of 20 million homes and provides pensions to 21 million   people.    Finance offers so much, but it still doesn�t offer enough for women. Jayne-Anne Gadhia�s review of gender   diversity in finance shows that female representation on boards is less than a quarter and a mere 14% on   executive committees. And these executive roles tend to be in corporate and support functions, such as HR   and legal, as opposed to corporate leadership roles such as the CEO and CIO.2    This is especially striking as more women than men start out in financial services, only for their   representation to diminish steadily through the ranks.    The value of diversity    This is an enormous missed opportunity.    Research on the value of diversity is abundant. For example, McKinsey finds that companies in the top   quartile of gender diversity are 15% more likely to have financial returns above their industry median.3   According to Credit Suisse, companies with more diverse boards outperformed peers by 26% and had higher   return on equity, lower leverage, and higher average net income growth.4       1     The City UK, Key Facts about UK-based financial and related professional services (April 2017).

First, it is the right thing to do; a public institution   should reflect the people it serves. Second, diversity can build the trust required to deliver our remits, as   people are more likely to trust people they recognise, reducing misperceptions that we are experts making   esoteric decisions in ivory towers for the benefit of others.5 Third, diversity leads to better decision-making,   more creative thinking and reduces the risks of groupthink and bias.6    This last point is critical. Almost all decisions in finance are taken under uncertainty, making it especially   important that decision makers are exposed to a range of views, and engage in open debates with people   whose perspectives challenge the prevailing wisdom.    Articulating why diversity and inclusion are important has helped the Bank move the dial.    When I joined the Bank, only 17% of senior managers were women, so we set an ambitious target to reach   35% by 2020. The Bank is on track to achieve this: today, 32% of senior management are female,   considerably above the 14% industry average. Our pipeline of future leaders also looks healthy: 46% of   colleagues below senior management are women.    This didn�t just happen. Reaching this point has required a deliberate, concentrated effort throughout the   organisation. The power of organisations like the WIBF is that they help such approaches permeate through   the industry. I hope that sharing the Bank�s experience will reinforce the current initiatives you may have in   your organisations and perhaps even trigger some new ideas about what more we all can do to achieve   gender equality in the industry.    Lessons from the Bank�s diversity and inclusion initiatives    Diversity is not a one hit wonder: focus on the whole process from recruitment to development to promotion    The Bank recognises that how it recruits affects whom it recruits. From school leavers to career returners,   the Bank has programmes to attract diverse talent at each stage of life.    To help develop the next generation, the Bank is working with schools to encourage a more diverse set of   students to study economics and finance. We provide free classroom materials for students aged 11?16 to   equip them with the analytical skills to make informed financial decisions, using real?world examples,   captivating videos and accessible case studies.7    By the end of 2018 we had reached 90,000 students through our �EconoMe� programme, one quarter of all   state secondary schools in the country. In an attempt to inspire children into finance, over the past year we   have also made more than 300 school visits, of which 75 were by the Bank's policy committee members.     5     Farmer, H, McKay, R, Tsakiris, M, Trust in Me (2013): �Trust in Me: Trustworthy Others Are Seen as More Physically Similar to the   Self�, Psychological Science.   6     Kahneman, D (2012) �Thinking Fast and Slow�, London.

The Bank   offers on the job training for all ages to entice diverse talent.    Our Future Capability programme is aimed at pupils keen to get their careers started after leaving school.   Almost 90% of our 2018 Future Capability intake were from a state school and over half were female.    Historically, one impediment to improving diversity in central banking has been the lack of diversity among   economics graduates. Just under a third of students studying economics to A-level and undergraduate level   in British Universities are female.8,9 To enable the Bank to hire from a broader set of disciplines and train   them as economists and technical specialists we have introduced an in-house Central Banking Qualification   (CBQ), in which graduate hires can earn a Masters Degree in Central Banking. This means that only half of   our graduates study economics, with the remainder plucked from the sciences, business and the humanities.    In recent years, our graduates have come from 40 different universities, a six-fold increase in the past   decade. In the Bank�s September 2019 intake, we expect that almost half � 46% � of graduates will be   female. This is the most diverse outcome since we began recording the diversity of graduate intakes.    Last year, the Bank won the TARGETjobs 'Most Popular Graduate Recruiter in Banking, Insurance and   Financial Services� for the second year running. This year, Barclays pipped us to the post but in the spirit of   sharing knowledge, we look forward to learning about the initiatives that have worked for them.    The Bank is also focusing on mid-career recruitment and last year almost half of our experienced hires were   female. To attract diverse candidates we review all job adverts to ensure they use only gender-neutral   language to avoid alienating or discouraging prospective applicants.    During the selection process, CVs are anonymised of all personal data, fostering a more objective   assessment of a candidate�s skills. At the interview stage, we ensure that panels are diverse in order to   mitigate affinity effects and unconscious biases. To make these initiatives a success, all our managers are   required to undertake unconscious bias training before recruiting.    Of course, not all talent develops on a linear career path; some people choose to take career breaks and   may require support to return to the workplace. Recognising this pool of untapped talent, the Bank   successfully piloted a Career Returners programme last year. The Bank offered a six-month placement to 16   people, with coaching and training support and fifteen women went on to take up permanent positions.   Bolstered by this success, we are rolling out the programme across the institution.    Recruitment is only the first step. As Jayne-Anne Gadhia observed in her review of gender diversity in   finance, a layer of �permafrost� sets in at middle management, where women get either stuck or leave the   sector.     8     Joint Council for Qualifications, 2017 GCSE and A-Level results, available at:   https://www.jcq.org.uk/examinationresults/gcses/2017/gcse-full-course-results-summer-2017/gcse-full-course-results-summer-2017.   9     HE student enrolments by subject of study 2016/17 available at: https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/students/table-9.                                                                                                                                     4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                              4   Once the right people are through the door they need to be developed and the culture needs to be   supportive. For the Bank that means identifying a pipeline of future leaders with a diverse and broad set of   experiences and pushing them in order to prepare themselves for bigger roles.    Last year for internal appointments, the Bank introduced pooled (or co-ordinated) recruitment for senior   appointments. Governors and Executive Directors come together to assess the roles available with the   candidates that have applied to try and find the best fit for each team, and for the institution as a whole.    This allows us to take a birds-eye view of diversity, rather than appointing in isolation, which risks reinforcing   homogeneity in our senior appointments. Pooling our appointments makes everyone realise how their   decision impacts the diversity of the whole organisation and helps to highlight the characteristics and skills   that may be missing or overrepresented in the senior leadership. And it provides real time feedback if   someone�s career is being held back by gaps in their experience or training. Pooled recruitment catalyses   the creation of essential development plans that prepare colleagues for future roles.    Since its inception, over half of the 15 promotions to Head of Division level between May 2018 and February   2019 using this pooled recruitment were women.    An important aspect of successful job applications and interviews is being able to demonstrate personal   development. For too long at the Bank, the opportunities to broaden skills and experience were granted on   an informal basis to those who either knew about the opportunity or were recommended by a colleague. This   tended to further reinforce homogeneity in senior leadership. In 2017, to level the playing field we launched   an internal �opportunities� board. This connects people who need help with a short-term project to those   able to offer it. Since we launched the site two years ago, 700 opportunities, from speech research to   short-term holiday cover have been advertised across the organisation.    The Bank has also created a �high potential� talent pipeline, which has 50% female representation, and   coupled this with new approaches to development support. Our new sponsorship programme connects a   high potential candidate and senior colleague to help sponsees identify assignments and opportunities to   hone their skills and increase their experience. The pilot consisted of 19 colleagues, 84% of whom were   female at the scale just below senior management. Building on this success, we have extended the   programme and 80% of colleagues in the second phase are female.    As well as sponsorship the Bank recognises that mentoring (both formal and informal) can have a positive   impact on an individual�s confidence to progress their careers. That�s why we launched our One Bank   Mentoring Scheme in 2017 and ensured it is open to all staff. Between June 2018 and February this year we   had 477 mentee applications, of whom 60% were women.                                                                                                                        5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                             5   Culture change takes time: align incentives and provide support at all layers to embed change    One of the problems that reviews such as the Treasury Committee�s Women in Finance Enquiry have   highlighted is the delta between a board�s progressive, longer-term thinking on diversity and the actions of   middle managers who often tend to recruit on a safe, short-term basis.    That is why executive leadership and communication on diversity is important. At the Bank, our Chief   Operating Officer, Joanna Place has the prescribed responsibility for diversity under the Senior Managers   Regime. She is accountable for organisation-wide progress against the Bank�s diversity targets and each   and every Deputy Governor is expected to get involved with diversity initiatives.    Changing culture requires both leadership and embedded structural change. When the most senior people in   the Bank demonstrate our core values - inclusive, collaborative, empowering, decisive and open - in their   everyday work, it becomes easier to make the required changes in all layers of the organisation. With our   senior leadership stepping up and both promoting and living the diversity agenda, we have been able to   embed these values directly into the performance assessments and pay of all colleagues.    As you may have experienced, one of the problems in finance can be bonus cultures based on self-   promotion rather than objective metrics, a culture of presenteeism over flexible working, and de facto   penalties imposed for maternity leave.    Let me explain how the Bank addresses each of these in turn.    First, the Bank has implemented a performance management process that promotes objectivity. Colleagues   are invited to have conversations with managers ahead of performance evaluation meetings. The Bank has   also disposed of fixed distribution curves for performance ratings, making the process less adversarial. We   also published clear guidelines internally on what is used to assess and reach a judgement on performance   and how pay is awarded against different measures.    Second, an inclusive culture recognises that work can be done in many ways; and that our best ideas can   occur at any time and in any place. 14% of our staff are employed on a formalised flexible working   arrangement, including remote working. And more men and senior management (almost one in five) than   ever before have taken up flexible working arrangements at the Bank. We have also recently completed a   technology update to enable more ad-hoc flexible working arrangements for all colleagues.    This approach has proved its worth as two thirds of colleagues at the Bank agreed in our survey last year   that there was a good balance between their work and personal life, five percentage points higher than the   national average. This is especially important as nearly two fifths of university graduate cite good work life   balance as the main thing they look for in an employer.    Third, the Bank encourages shared paternity leave and over the last year, 59 colleagues took up the offer,   compared to 187 people on maternity leave. We have a generous pay package of six months at full pay and                                                                                                                     6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                             6   three at statutory pay. Colleagues are given ten Keep In touch (KIT) days and are offered IT equipment to   take home during maternity leave to enable them to maintain contact with the Bank and ease their eventual   return to work. The Bank has been successful in retaining female talent, with the Bank�s maternity returner   rate at almost 90% over the past few years.    What gets measured gets managed: be transparent about progress    Building an inclusive culture is impossible without transparency.10    In recent years, important strides have been made on transparency around the gender pay gap.   Transparency delivers accountability and in making this information public, the sector must acknowledge the   work it has to do to close the gap. In the financial sector, the average mean pay gap at banks and building   societies is 35% and 31% in insurance companies.    For the Bank, the mean gender pay gap is better than the industry average at 20%. The gap is driven by the   difference between male and female representation at senior levels. This is not an excuse. As I hope I have   demonstrated, the Bank is making strides to close this gap in a fair and sustainable manner that empowers   all colleagues at the Bank. Nonetheless, the disclosure helps everyone to track progress and hold the Bank   to account.    To that end, HR publishes diversity metrics by division every quarter. The internal committee of Governors   as well as the Court of Directors (the equivalent of our Board) regularly review and discuss the Bank-wide   and divisional figures to identify areas for improvement.    In 2018 we were also one of the first organisations to conduct and publish a special Cognitive Diversity   Survey to gain a better understanding of how our colleagues feel about working at the Bank. The survey   measured seven inclusivity metrics including interpersonal interactions, flexible working, communication with   leaders as well as recruitment and promotion, and results are cut across twelve different aspects of diversity.    Our results indicate colleagues are generally positive about inclusiveness at the Bank on every metric   measured by the survey. 80% of colleagues in our annual employee survey reported that the Bank takes   diversity seriously, seven percentage points higher than the UK average. And 87% of Bank colleagues say   they are treated with respect as an individual, six percentage points higher than the UK average.    These survey results and the progress against our targets are encouraging, but there is always more to do.    And diversity is, of course, about more than gender, including ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation and   socio-economic background. The steps that we have taken to improve gender diversity and the lessons we   learn from the industry are supporting the Bank�s approach to increase diversity and inclusion more broadly.     10     Women in Finance, House of Commons Treasury Committee, Fifteenth Report of Session 2017 � 19.

Without delaying the awards any longer, let me leave you with three reflections that sum up what the Bank of   England has learned from its experience of promoting diversity and inclusion.    First, in a world of division, fusion will bring breakthroughs. Diversity delivers value, but it is also, quite simply   the right thing to do. So select your teams wisely and recognise that while diversity is a reality, inclusion is a   choice that we should all take.    Second, developing the right people requires a culture of inclusion that values diverse ideas, encourages   open debate, and empowers people at all levels to take initiative. These efforts must be purposeful and   coordinated.    Third, we�re all in this together. Share your experiences; if something has worked well in your organisation   afford others the opportunity to try it in theirs.    Finally, we should take opportunities to celebrate successful achievements of women in finance and of the   men and women who have given their time and effort as we strive to achieve equality. These are the role   models for the next generation.                                                                                                                          8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                 8"
2019-06-18	"Remarks to Open Policy Panel    Mark Carney, Governor Bank of England     ECB Forum on Central Banking � 20 Years of European Economic and Monetary Union   Sintra, Portugal    Tuesday 18 June 2019                                                                                                             1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx   Introduction    It is an honour to participate in such a distinguished panel on such a special occasion.    Before I begin, I should emphasise that the usual caveat of the past providing no guide to future performance   applies particularly to my remarks today. My reflections are on history alone. I am speaking in the MPC�s   blackout period, so my comments have no bearing whatsoever on the decision to be announced by the MPC   on Thursday.    There are no messages � coded or clarion � in what follows � about policy.    But there is one message that my presence here today is meant to convey. I want to pay homage to   President Draghi�s extraordinary leadership of the ECB, the ESRB, the FSB and, by example, of the G7 and   G20. The crisis years here have been extraordinarily challenging but these challenges have been met   because of his leadership, innovation and determination.    The theme for this year�s conference is �20 years of European Economic and Monetary Union�.    I will focus my remarks today on how monetary policy has evolved over that period, drawing on the   experiences of the ECB and Bank of England.    Economic performance    The global financial crisis divides the past twenty years.    In the decade prior to the crisis, in both the euro area and the UK, inflation was low, stable and predictable.   Inflation targets were achieved without causing undesirable volatility in output and employment, the so-called   �divine coincidence�.1 Both regions experienced continuous expansions in activity. It is not entirely   surprising that �end of history� declarations of the Great Moderation were increasingly commonplace.    But such nominal stability masked growing financial imbalances and increasing strains in competitiveness.    The financial crisis would expose how a healthy focus on price stability had become a dangerous distraction.   Central banks had won the war against inflation only to lose the peace.    When the music stopped, the consequences for the real economy were dire. In both the euro area and UK,   output fell by around 6% and unemployment rates rose initially by 2� percentage points. It took 7 years for   GDP per capita to recover to pre-crisis levels.    In response, the financial system and the institutional architecture have been fundamentally reformed. The   capital requirements of large global banks are ten times higher than the pre-crisis standard. Liquid assets �    1    See Blanchard, O., and J. Gal� (2007).

We are ending too   big to fail and transforming the resilience of financial market infrastructure. Macroprudential is no longer the   policy that dares not speak its name.    To safeguard these hard-won reforms, Europe now has a Single Supervisory Mechanism and European   Systemic Risk Board. The Bank of England now houses the Prudential Regulation Committee and the   Financial Policy Committee. The independence of these committees and their accountability to the people   they serve through their respective parliaments are essential bulwarks against the inevitable recidivism that   follows a financial crisis. The longer we go without disruption the more important it is to remember,   remember that when it comes to financial stability, success is an orphan.    Since the crisis, macroeconomic outcomes have been much less benign. Growth in both the euro area and   the UK has been, on average, a percentage point lower; and inflation has been twice as volatile. There has   been a persistent margin of spare capacity, with unemployment, on average, 1-1� percentage points higher.    But there have also been important differences. While the euro area has continued to experience �divine   coincidence� the UK has not (Chart 1). In the euro area, inflation has averaged half a point below target,   reflecting in part the drag from persistent slack in the labour market. In contrast, UK inflation has been above   target, averaging 2.3%, during a period where the economy was operating well below potential. That   reflects the inflationary impacts of two large exchange rate depreciations and weak productivity that have   offset a major positive shock to labour supply. This has created tensions between short-term output and   inflation stabilisation in the UK that have not been evident in other major economic regions.

It directs the MPC to   �promote understanding of the trade-offs inherent in setting monetary policy� including importantly �the   horizon over which the Committee judges it appropriate to return inflation to target�.    The MPC used this flexibility to support activity following the referendum in the wake of the large   depreciation.    In exceptional circumstances, like Brexit, when the economy is facing profound structural change, the MPC   can extend the horizon over which it returns inflation to target from above in order to balance the effects on   jobs and activity. After all, even though monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely   to accompany the transition to new trading arrangements with the EU, it can influence how this hit to   incomes is distributed between job losses and price rises.    This flexibility cannot be used without limit of course, and the MPC has set out its framework for managing   the trade-off including guidance for its tolerance of the overshoot of inflation.3    Developments in monetary policy    In response to the challenging post-crisis environment, the conduct of monetary policy has made important   advances that have helped to shape the expectations of both market participants and the public we serve.     2     The ECB also has flexibility to pursue its inflation target, but given the absence of trade-off inducing shocks has not yet had cause to   use it. The ECB General Council adopted a quantitative definition of price stability in 1998 as a year-on-year increase in the   Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%; and from 2003, they clarified that this objective was to   maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.   3     See Carney M (2017), Lambda, speech given at the London School of Economics, 16 January 2017.                                                                                                                                            4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                          4   To provide stimulus, central banks have taken policy rates to the effective lower bound and beyond by using   forward guidance, new lending facilities and asset purchase programmes.    In parallel, monetary policy communications have been transformed. Committee decisions are now   explained more fully, in a more timely and targeted way. Given greater supply uncertainty, more details are   provided about the assumptions underpinning forecasts. And in the face of large downside tail risks, more   facets of the reaction function are being spelt out.    While there have been many innovations, given the time available today, I will focus on two:   communications including forward guidance; and central bank facilities.    Communications including forward guidance    For both the euro area and UK, the past decade has been marked by increased transparency and more   focused communications.    The ECB has followed each monetary policy decision with a statement and press conference at each   meeting since its creation in 1999 and these were supplemented a year later with macroeconomic   projections. In 2015, it dropped the frequency of meetings from twelve to eight to allow for a fuller passage   of time between decisions, and supplemented the statement with a fuller account of its monetary policy   deliberations, published four weeks after policy announcements.    Twenty years ago, the Bank of England was publishing minutes of its monthly policy meetings and quarterly   economic forecasts in its Inflation Reports. It didn�t however always issue statements following decisions.    Following the Warsh Report in 2015, we overhauled our communications. For similar reasons to the ECB,   we moved from twelve to eight meetings per year, and we began publishing a statement every time we met   and releasing Minutes, Inflation Reports and Monetary Policy Summaries simultaneously on the logic that   one decision should merit only one news event.    The MPC now provides much more detailed information on the assumptions that underlie our forecasts and   regularly assesses them versus actual outturns. We release our key judgements for the global economy,   domestic demand and the pace of demand relative to supply capacity, and we publish paths for variables   that we and others can monitor to see whether the forecast is on track. We also now publish annual stock   takes of the supply side of the economy and of the forecast errors we have made over the past year.    Last year, the MPC introduced layered communication to reach the broadest possible audience. In addition   to the Inflation Report we now publish a visual summary, or top layer, which distils the document down to its   main messages with a few accompanying diagrams. It is intended for a non-technical audience. Following                                                                                                                     5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx               5   the changes, we have seen web traffic to Inflation Report pages increase by a third and research suggests   that public understanding has increased by a quarter.4    The biggest innovation in communication has been the introduction of forward guidance as a tool to influence   short-term interest rates once policy rates hit the effective lower bound. The objective has been the same for   both the ECB and the Bank of England � to clarify our reaction function in a highly uncertain world.    In a perfect world, guidance would be redundant. People would know how the Committee intends to set   rates over the future and how those intentions would adjust to economic developments in all eventualities �   the so-called reaction function. But the world is complex and people (outside this audience) don�t have   endless time to devote to understanding monetary policy. In practice, therefore, guidance can be useful in   providing people with information about how the Committee sets policy and, over time, in improving the   understanding of how monetary policy will adjust to news.    This can make monetary policy more effective by reducing unwarranted volatility in interest rate expectations   and the extent to which the central bank has to move the policy rate to meet the inflation target. The more   those expectations are aligned with the policy path necessary to achieve the inflation target, the higher the   probability that the policy objective will be achieved.    The ECB�s experience provides a classic example.    The ECB�s use of forward guidance has evolved over time with the first use in 2013. The previous year   President Draghi had skilfully given assurance that the ECB would do �whatever it takes to preserve the   euro�5 and the Governing Council followed through with a program of Outright Monetary Transactions which   restored sovereign bond spreads to more sustainable levels.    In the wake of spillovers from the US taper tantrum, guidance was used to anchor policy expectations in the   face of a still fragile euro-area recovery (Chart 2). The ECB stated that rates were expected to remain at   present or lower levels for �an extended period of time� based on �an overall subdued outlook for inflation   extending into the medium term and subdued monetary dynamics�.    In subsequent episodes, ECB guidance on interest rates has always been tied to the outlook for inflation,   with its time contingent nature becoming more specific, first with links to the duration of asset purchases and   more recently to specific calendar dates. In its most recent statement, the ECB indicated it expected interest   rates to �remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020�.       4     See Bholat, Broughton, Parker, Ter Meer and Walczak (2018), Enhancing central bank communications with behavioural insights,   Bank of England Staff Working Paper No. 750.   5     See verbatim of the remarks made at the Global Investment Conference in London, 26 July 2012.                                                                                                                                    6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                  6   Chart 2: ECB forward guidance has helped to anchor forward interest rates through the euro area   recovery        Introduced rates                          Linked forward                                                                                  Extended by 6 months                Per cent            guidance                            guidance to APP                                                                                       to end 2019                                                                                                                           0.6                        Euro Fwd 1y rate                             Date based guidance                Extended by                                                                       to summer 2019                   6 months to                        Euro Deposit Facility Rate                                                                         0.4                                                                                                         first half of                                                                                                             2020                                                                                                                           0.2                                                                                                                            0.0                                                                                                                            -0.2                                                                                                                            -0.4                                                                                                                            -0.6       2013         2014           2015            2016           2017           2018           2019           2020       The ECB has also innovated with guidance on its asset purchase programme. In the September 2014 press   conference the President said that the aim of policy was to steer the balance sheet towards its size at the   beginning of 2012. This guidance was important to dispel any doubts about the ECB�s ability to deliver.    The Bank of England introduced guidance in 2013 in order to secure the nascent recovery while granting the   MPC the flexibility to learn more about the rapidly changing supply capacity of the economy. When the long-   awaited UK recovery began to take hold, even though inflation had been persistently above target, there   remained a significant but highly uncertain margin of spare capacity in the economy and it was unclear   whether productivity growth would pick up.    We felt that guidance was essential to help clarify our reaction function so that stakeholders could learn   alongside the MPC.    During previous periods of accelerating growth and firming business confidence, the MPC had always   tightened policy significantly. Indeed, on the basis of this past behaviour in the great moderation, the MPC   would have raised interest rates by 2 to 3 percentage points between August 2013 and the end of 2014   (Charts 3 and 4).6       6     See Carney M (2018), �Guidance, Contingencies and Brexit�. For anyone who might suggest the MPC should have followed that   reaction function, note that, even on unchanged policy, CPI inflation by the summer of 2016 was running at only about �% and core CPI   inflation around 1�%.                                                                                                                                    7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                     7   Chart 3: Close correlation between output and monetary policy pre-crisis      3 month moving average, balance                                                  3 month moving average, bps     65                                                                                                      50                                                                Combined CIPS output survey     60                                                         (LHS)                                        25      55                                                                                                                     0      50                                                                                                                     -25      45                                                                                                                     -50      40                                                                                                                     -75      35                                                               Average MPC vote, including QE                        -100                                                                      (RHS)     30                                                                                                                     -125       1998      2000       2002      2004       2006      2008       2010      2012       2014      2016      2018    Sources: IHS Markit, ONS and Bank calculations.

Six years ago, the MPC recognised that past should not be prologue. The MPC was pretty certain there was   a large amount of slack, although it had questions over how much productive capacity had been destroyed   following the crisis; how quickly productivity growth would recover; and whether labour supply would change   in the wake of reforms and a heavy burden of household debt.    Such uncertainties about supply meant that knowing what was happening to demand was no longer   sufficient for gauging the appropriate policy response.    That is why the Committee provided forward guidance that explicitly linked any potential change in interest   rates to the unemployment rate � a clear and widely understood indicator of the degree of slack.    The message the Committee gave UK households and businesses was simple: the MPC would not even   think about tightening policy at least until the unemployment rate had fallen below 7%, consistent with the   creation of around three quarter of a million jobs.    What we � and others � learnt as the recovery progressed was that the UK economy had substantially more   spare capacity than previously thought. The MPC could be patient.    As a consequence, even as the recovery strengthened and survey indicators of output growth reached levels   previously associated with sharp policy tightenings (Chart 4), market expectations about the future path of   policy remained subdued (Chart 3). Participants understood the conditionality of guidance, as they and the   MPC learnt that there was still considerable spare capacity in the economy.                                                                                                                                     8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                  8   Chart 4: Forward market interest rates rose only modestly as unemployment fell towards 7%                                                         August 2013                  Data published showing Percent                                                      guidance issued               unemployment fell to 6.9%   4.0                                                                         February 2014                                                                                                                           3.5                                                                        guidance issued                                                                                                                           3.0                 Counterfactual path for Bank Rate                 based on historic correlation with                                                                        2.5                 survey indicators of output growth                                                                                                                           2.0                                                                                                                            1.5                  UK 1 year instantaneous                                                                                   1.0                 forward OIS rates                                                                                                                           0.5                                                                                                                            0.0       Jan. 12          Jul. 12           Jan. 13            Jul. 13           Jan. 14            Jul. 14     The MPC�s second use of guidance responded to another structural development: the sharp fall in the   equilibrium real interest rate, or r*. Out of that guidance came the phrase �limited and gradual�, so often   repeated it is now part of the monetary policy furniture. In fact, it recently celebrated its fifth birthday.    This guidance was grounded in an early exposition of why r* was low and not expected to recover soon.7   Secular drivers that had pushed down the equilibrium rate prior to the crisis � including slower potential   growth, demographic forces, changes in income distribution and excess saving in emerging markets � were   likely to persist. The MPC judged there is a further wedge pushing r* in the UK below global r* because of   fiscal drag and heightened uncertainty.8    The MPC clearly signalled that the policy path was likely to be very different from during past recoveries. It   observed that the appropriate path of interest rate increases to eliminate slack and keep inflation close to the   target was expected to be gradual and, even once spare capacity had been absorbed, the appropriate level   of Bank Rate was expected to be materially below the pre-crisis average of 5%.    This may be obvious now, but it wasn�t then when it mattered most.    Importantly, the interest rate expectations of UK households and businesses have remained well anchored   both as the recovery has progressed and even as policy was tightened in November 2017 and August 2018   (Chart 5).       7     See Carney, M (2013), �The spirit of the season� at The Economic Club of New York; and the box on page 42 of the August 2014   Inflation Report.   8     See the box on page 39 of the August 2018 Inflation Report.                                                                                                                                    9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx                                  9   Chart 5: Households and businesses have consistently expected increases in interest rates to be   gradual and limited                                                                                                                        Per cent          2014 Q1                                                                                                             6          2015 Q1                                         Pre-crisis average level of Bank Rate (5.2%)           2016 Q1                                                                                                                   5           2017 Q1                                                                                                                                    4          2018 Q1          2019 Q1                                                                                                                   3                                                                                                                                     2                                                                                                                                     1                                                                                                                                     0      0                  1                   2                 3                     4                   5                      6                                                        Years ahead     The experience in the euro area and UK demonstrates how guidance can be effective in managing   expectations as circumstances change.    As intended, �limited and gradual� guidance has dampened interest rate volatility (Chart 6) and reduced the   correlation between interest rate volatility and economic uncertainty (Chart 7). Both developments have   increased the degree of monetary policy stimulus, thereby reinforcing the recovery during turbulent times.

2019-06-27	"Enable, Empower, Ensure:   A New Finance for the New Economy   Speech given by   Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England     Speech at the Lord Mayor�s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London at   the Mansion House, London   20 June 2019       I am grateful to Jennifer Nemeth and James Benford for their assistance in preparing these remarks,   and to Julia Kowalski, Tom Mutton, Varun Paul, Simon Scorer, Oliver Thew and the Climate Hub   team for their help with background research and analysis.                                                                                                          1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches   New Economy � New Finance    There�s a new economy emerging driven by changes in technology, demographics and the environment.    This new economy requires a new finance.    A new finance to serve the digital economy.    A new finance with products that are more cost effective, better tailored, and more inclusive.    A new finance to support the transition to a sustainable economy.    A new finance that balances innovation with resilience.    With its leadership in fintech and green finance, the UK private sector is creating the new finance, but your   efforts will be more effective with the right conditions in which to innovate and the level playing fields on   which to compete.    New Finance - New Bank    That�s why a new finance demands a new Bank of England.    Our strategy is to enable innovation and to empower competition, while ensuring monetary and financial   stability. Our levers are the hard and soft infrastructure that we control:           ?   Our hard infrastructure, such as access to our balance sheet and access to our Real-Time Gross              Settlement (RTGS) system, the heart of the UK payments system.           ?   And our soft infrastructure, such as our rules, regulations and standards.    In this spirit, last year at Mansion House I announced that Huw van Steenis would lead a review of the future   of the UK financial system, including recommendations for how the Bank could best support innovation while   continuing to promote resilience.1    I would like to thank Huw and the Bank of England team, who over the past nine months have met 300   entrepreneurs, investors, consumer groups, charities, business leaders and policymakers across the country   and around the world to produce an excellent report.    Today, we published Huw�s recommendations and the Bank of England�s response.2 And tonight, I would   like to focus on a few of the actions that the Bank will take to enable the new economy; to ensure the   resilience of the financial system; and to support the UK�s transition to a carbon-neutral economy.     1       Carney, M (June 2018) �New Economy, New Finance, New Bank� speech given at Mansion House.                                                                                                                   2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                            2   First, to enable the digital economy    The very nature of commerce is changing. Last year, one fifth of all sales in the UK were online.3 Next year,   it will be one quarter. Over the past decade, the proportion of total payments made in cash has declined   from two thirds to one quarter.4    The digital economy is more inclusive, offering easier and more cost effective routes to market for firms both   large and small, and greater access for consumers both near and far.    This new economy is placing new demands on finance. Consumers and businesses increasingly expect   transactions to be settled in real time, checkout to become an historical anomaly, and payments across   borders to be indistinguishable from those across the street.    While there have been some notable successes, the UK system has a way to go before it meets these   expectations.    Thus far, most innovation has happened around payment initiation � the method used to instruct a payment   � such as credit or debit card, banking app or mobile wallet.    There have also been some advances in the networks � or rails � that underpin some of these apps. For   example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) launched a decade ago has made payments quicker (within two   hours) and more cost effective by encouraging direct bank-to-bank transfers.    While mobile app PayM uses FPS to facilitate direct bank-to-bank payments between individuals via text, it   requires both the sender and recipient to be signed up to the third party service. But few are.5 And FPS is   not yet used for in-store or online purchases as the infrastructure required at the point of sale does not   reliably exist in the UK.6    In these regards, the UK is still a long way behind countries such as Sweden, the Netherlands and India   where users can make direct, free and real time bank-to-bank payments in stores and online with a text or a   scan of a QR code.7    UK card payments are convenient and they are now the most popular means of payment, but they can cost   between 0.5% and 2% of the total transaction value, and it can take three days for the merchant to receive   their money.8      2     See: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/future-finance.   3     ONS: Comparing �bricks and mortar� store sales with online retail sales (August 2018).   4     UK Finance: UK Payment Markets Summary (2019).   5     See: https://paym.co.uk/how-it-works/.   6     Particularly the soft infrastructure � such as rules around use and consumer protection.   7     In Sweden, Swish launched in 2012 by the six largest Swedish banks and connects bank accounts to mobile numbers, allowing money   transfer in real time and eradicating the need for a card reader. In the Netherlands, iDEAL facilitates direct bank-to-bank payment for   online purchases. India uses GooglePay technology to enable direct bank transfers through its Unified Payments Interface, a central   platform which connects entities for real-time payment.   8     McKinsey research for Future of Finance Report; and UK Card Association Data.                                                                                                                                      3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                  3   And all these systems in the UK � whether card or bank payment � still depend on existing core   infrastructure meaning they either carry the associated costs and limitations on speed or they require the   right point of sale infrastructure for their full benefits to be realised.    The scope for improving cross border payments is bigger still. These can cost up to 10 times their domestic   equivalent.9 Anti-money laundering checks that are rightly required can be cumbersome, and settlement is   slow with money taking up to a week to reach the recipient.    Most fundamentally, the new payment system must end the inequity that the people with the least money   pay the most for financial services.    The revolution of payments may not be driven by the old bank-based systems but by a new architecture.   Major changes are on the horizon, bringing enormous advantages but also more than a few new challenges.   That�s why the Bank fully supports the Payments Strategy Review the Chancellor has launched this   evening.    To support private innovation and to empower competition, the Bank is levelling the playing field between old   and new. This means allowing competitors access to the same resources as incumbents while holding the   same risks to the same standards.    The Bank is in the midst of an ambitious rebuild of its Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, which   processes �650 billion of payments on average every day. Until recently, only commercial banks10 had   direct access to it, and alternative payment service providers (or PSPs) had to route through participating   banks. That made sense in the old financial world arranged around a series of hubs and spokes, but it is   increasingly anachronistic in the new, distributed finance that is emerging.    So we are now making it easier for a broad set of firms to plug in and compete with more traditional   providers. In July 2017, we became the first G7 central bank to open up access to our payment services to a   new generation of non-bank PSPs. Since then, six have become members, processing over four million   transactions over the past year. There is now a growing pipeline of twenty firms looking to join.11    Responding to demands from innovators, the RTGS rebuild will also now provide API access to users to   read and write payments data, as well as implementing a system whereby each payment will be tagged with   information in a standardised format across the world. This global messaging standard will speed up   settlement both domestically and across borders.    It is not a one-way street, however. As we extend access, we will safeguard resilience by holding settlement   account holders to the appropriate standards. Along with the FCA and HMRC, who together supervise these   institutions, we are committed to applying a strengthened supervisory regime for those who apply for an     9     McKinsey Global Payments (2016): strong fundamentals despite uncertain times.   10      As well as Financial Market Infrastructure providers such as Visa.   11      See: Bank of England: A Blueprint for a new RTGS service for the United Kingdom (May 2017).                                                                                                                 4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                          4   RTGS settlement account, to give assurance that non-bank PSPs can safely take their place at the heart of   the payment system.    We can go even further. Today, the Bank of England is announcing plans to consult on opening   access to our balance sheet to new payment providers.12    Historically, only commercial banks were able to hold interest-bearing deposits, or reserves, at the Bank.13   That reflected their role at the core of the payment system. As new payment providers and systems emerge,   access to the Bank�s core infrastructure should change and it makes sense to consider whether they too can   hold funds overnight on the Bank�s balance sheet.    From the Bank�s perspective, expanding access can improve the transmission of monetary policy and   increase competition. It can also support financial stability by allowing settlement in the ultimate risk free   asset, and reducing reliance on major banks. Users should benefit from the reduced costs and increased   certainty that comes with banking at the central bank.    From the perspectives of UK households and businesses, wider access can improve inclusion and services.    This access could empower a host of new innovation. In wholesale markets, consortia of broker dealers are   working to develop settlement systems using distributed ledger technology that could overhaul how markets   operate. These consortia, such as USC, propose to issue digital tokens that are fully backed by central bank   money, allowing instant settlement. This could also plug into �tokenised assets� � conventional securities   also represented on blockchain�and smart contracts. This can drive efficiency and resilience in operational   processes and reduce counterparty risks in the system, unlocking billions of pounds in capital and liquidity   that can be put to more productive uses.14    The potential transformation in retail payments is even more fundamental.    Earlier this week, a cooperative of technology companies proposed a new payments infrastructure based on   an international stablecoin � Libra. Libra would be backed by reserve assets in a basket of currencies   including sterling. It could be exchanged between users on messaging platforms and with participating       12      Currently, the criteria for access to our balance sheet, defined at the time of the Winters Review, are three-fold: firms should be   inherently exposed to overnight liquidity risk, they should be systemically important, and they should be regulated to the same standard   as UK banks. In practice, that means banks, CCPs and broker-dealers are eligible for access, but other firms are not. The Bank will   reach out to firms and to users of payments services to understand the needs of participants in this market and the barriers that still   exist to competition and innovation. This dialogue will allow us to consult on the appropriate level of access to the Bank�s infrastructure.   For more information, see the Bank of England�s response to the Future of Finance Review available at:   https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/future-finance.   13      In recent years we have expanded access to our balance sheet to central counterparties and broker-dealers to recognise the   important role played by these firms in the provision of critical financial services to the real economy. In providing these critical functions,   both broker-dealers and CCPs are exposed to liquidity risk. As the supplier of the economy�s most liquid asset, central bank money, the   Bank is able to be a �back-stop� provider of liquidity, and can therefore provide liquidity insurance to the financial system, promoting   financial stability.   14      Oliver Wyman: Fintech 2.0 Paper: rebooting financial services (June 2015) and McKinsey: Global Payments report (2016).                                                                                                                                               5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                           5   retailers. As designed, Libra may substantially improve financial inclusion and dramatically lower the costs of   domestic and cross border payments.15    The Bank of England approaches Libra with an open mind but not an open door. Unlike social media for   which standards and regulations are being debated well after they have been adopted by billions of users,   the terms of engagement for innovations such as Libra must be adopted in advance of any launch    Libra, if it achieves its ambitions, would be systemically important. As such it would have to meet the highest   standards of prudential regulation and consumer protection. It must address issues ranging from anti-money   laundering to data protection to operational resilience. Libra must also be a pro-competitive, open platform   that new users can join on equal terms. In addition, authorities will need to consider carefully the   implications of Libra for monetary and financial stability. Our citizens deserve no less.    Leveraging our position at the heart of the international financial system and one of the world�s largest   fintech hubs, the Bank of England will help lead the way on these issues at the G7, G20, the FSB, BIS and   IMF.    Whatever the fate of Libra, its creation underscores the imperative of transforming payments. The Bank�s   strategy to open access to a wide range of payment solutions combined with appropriate regulatory oversight   of them maximises the likelihood that the payments revolution will meet the demands of the new economy   and the needs of all our citizens.    Supporting more lending to SMEs through an open platform    Big data is opening up new opportunities for more competitive, platform-based finance of SMEs. Artificial   Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques are already mining fields of data generated by online   activity. This has the potential to yield enormous benefits for households and businesses by opening up new   lines of credit, providing greater choice, better-targeted products and keener pricing.    Putting data to work is critical to closing one of the biggest funding gaps in the country.    SMEs are the engine room of our economy, generating around 60% of all private sector employment and   accounting for over half of all private business turnover.16 And yet SMEs face a �22bn funding gap.17 Almost   half of all SMEs don�t plan to use external finance, citing the hassle or time associated with applying. Of   those that have approached their bank, two fifths have been rejected.18    Part of the problem is that the assets that SMEs are seeking to borrow against are increasingly intangible �   the value of a brand or user base � rather than physical assets, like building or machinery. SMEs that have   not borrowed lack the historic data required for credit scoring. And legal requirements to prevent money    15      See: https://libra.org/en-US/.   16      Federation of Small Business: https://www.fsb.org.uk/media-centre/small-business-statistics.   17      NAO report �improving access to finance for SMEs (Nov 2013).   18      Report by British Business Bank: Small Business Finance Markets (2019).                                                                                                                 6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                          6   laundering and �Know Your Customer� make the process especially burdensome for a small business with   limited resources.    This should not be the case in a data-rich world. Lenders should be able to access a broader set of   information on which to base credit decisions.    Already, search and social media data are supplementing traditional metrics to unlock finance for smaller   enterprises whose assets are increasingly intangible. In the UK, Iwoca has made over �900mn worth of   loans based on trading data, such as sales and customer reviews, to over 25,000 small businesses over the   past five years. Even the big banks are getting in on the action. Earlier this month, Santander announced   that it was partnering with eBay to offer small business loans, based on sales, cash flow and customer   review data to sellers on the eBay platform.    These initiatives are welcome but are still too small to plug the SME funding gap in the UK. To make real   inroads, SMEs must be able to identify the data relevant to their businesses, incorporate it into their   individual credit files, and easily share these files with potential providers of finance through a national SME   financing platform.    This would put into practice the recommendations from Professor Jason Furman�s Digital Competition Panel   report on how to extract value from data and promote competition. One of the most important   recommendations in this regard is to give consumers control of their data. This would allow consumers to   move their personal information from one platform to another and avoid lock-in effects, opening the door to   new services.19 To some extent, this is what Open Banking hopes to achieve. Although to make this a   success means establishing common off the-shelf API standards and operating platforms onto which   developers can build.    An open platform for SME lending would enable open banking and empower SMEs. It would help avoid   lock-in on existing platforms and enable providers of finance to compete for SME lending, helping to broaden   the products available to companies and offer more competitive rates, making access to finance quick, easy   and cost effective.20    It is not for the Bank of England to build this platform but we can help lay some of groundwork. The   messaging standards we are adopting in the new RTGS will also include tagging payments with a unique ID   called a Legal Entity Identifier (LEI).21 This will be mandated for financial institutions and as a next step we   are considering how to extend this to corporate payments. That could mean that the payment data sent via   CHAPS of non-financial firms could be made available for inclusion in a portable credit file. The LEI could     19     See: Furman, J �Unlocking digital competition� Report of the digital competition expert panel (March 2019).   20     See: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/future-finance.   21     The introduction of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) will enable consistent and accurate identification of legal entities on a global basis.   Their introduction was pioneered by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) following the financial crisis as a means of precisely identifying   counterparty risks and exposures. The LEI is linked to a publically available database about each registered entity. LEIs are not yet   widely used in payments or supply chains. Following a consultation, the Bank is making LEIs mandatory for all payments initiated   between financial entities.                                                                                                                                              7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                        7   also act as the unique identifier for a digital ID, which could help the two-step verification process required for   a secure system.    The Bank will submit a formal response on how to develop an open platform for competitive SME   finance to the Smart Data Review referenced by the Chancellor this evening.    Strengthen resilience in the face of new risks    The City of London has maintained its pre-eminence by innovating. This was as true in the First Industrial   Revolution when finance oiled the pistons of the steam engines, as it is today at the dawn of the Fourth   Industrial Revolution, with the advent of cloud computing and the robosapien fund manager.    Today the key competitive advantage in financial services is how firms � and supervisors�collect, store and   analyse the explosion of data. Just as the steam engine transformed manufacturing, AI, ML and cloud-   based technologies are transforming services.    Accordingly, the second focus of the Bank�s initial response is how new general purpose technologies, like   the Cloud and AI, can be used to strengthen the resilience of the system.    Embracing these technologies could herald leaner, faster and more tailored financial services. Banking is   already the second biggest global spender on AI systems (after retail) and the sector is expected to invest a   further $6 billion on AI this year.22    A quarter of major banks� activities and almost a third of all UK payments activity are already hosted on the   Cloud, and there are considerable opportunities for even more intensive usage.23 Cloud service providers   offer ready-made solutions that can speed up time to market, provide superior analytics, and enable   businesses to adjust quickly their business models. If deployed at scale, cloud technology could provide low-   cost, resilient computing power and easy access to AI capabilities, unlocking 30-50% unit cost savings.24    These savings can be passed onto customers and, if properly managed, improve the resilience of the overall   system. For these reasons, the Bank of England is open to greater adoption of the Cloud and usage of AI.   This means ensuring that these technologies are adopted in a safe manner, in ways that increase resilience.    Careful attention will have to be given to risks, including of those associated in the single point of failure and   market concentration. Two providers account for nearly half of revenues in cloud computing, bringing scale   and efficiency, but also concerns about dependence and a single point of failure in the case of a cyber-   attack. In AI and ML, there is a reliance on data, but when there are biases in data or algorithms, or the   situation isn�t captured by past experience prediction becomes difficult and judgement becomes more   important. These situations require robust governance at board level.    22      IDC: Wordlwide Semiannual AI Systems Spending Guide (March 2019).   23      See: https://www.bis.org/review/r180727a.pdf and Finastra, FTI Consuting Survey 2019.   24      McKinsey & Company research for the Future of Finance review.                                                                                                                     8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                              8   To ensure that the benefits of cloud computing are realised and the associated risks are well   managed, the PRA will issue a Supervisory Statement in the autumn that sets out its supervisory   approach. The Bank, together with the FCA, will also establish a forum to discuss the results of a   survey that it has conducted on AI use in finance and determine an appropriate supervisory   approach.    The Bank�s management and analysis of data is critical to our effectiveness as regulators and to the City�s   competitiveness.    The Bank now receives 65 billion data points each year of firm-related information. To put that into context,   reviewing it all would be the equivalent of each supervisor reading the complete works of Shakespeare twice   a week, every week of the year.    For firms, while the Cloud and AI have reduced the costs of storage and analysis, producing regulatory   submissions is still labour intensive and costs the industry an estimated �2-4.5 billion per year.25    This is the new frontier of regulatory efficiency and effectiveness. The PRA is exploring how new   technologies could streamline firms� compliance and regulatory processes while improving our ability to   analyse relevant data.    We see opportunities at each of the three stages of the supervisory process:    1.          Rule-setting and reporting;    2.          Analysis and monitoring; and    3.          Setting and communicating a supervisory strategy to mitigate identified risks.    Consider rule setting and reporting compliance. At over 638,000 words, the PRA Rule Book is longer than   War and Peace. It is also somewhat less interesting and infinitely more complex. We are currently using   advanced analytics to understand that complexity and to simplify our rules in order to make compliance with   them easier and less expensive.    An even bigger opportunity lies in the Bank re-thinking completely how we collect, store and analyse data.   We cannot do this in isolation but will engage with industry to explore a range of options.    Our vision is that the Bank could be able to �pull the data on demand� from firms rather than �sit back and   wait to receive data� from them. With the right API, Web Portal or Platform, manual interventions could   become obsolete, making the process quicker, more efficient and hugely less expensive. It would free up   resources for firms to focus on delivering a better service to their customers, and it could discipline us to take   only the data that we need to use and have the capacity to review.     25        �McKinsey & Company research for the Future of Finance review�.                                                                                                                  9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                             9   Equally important, utilising ML and AI to analyse the data could free up supervisors� time to add the greatest   value where humans excel over machines: judgement.    That is why the Bank is today launching a Review to explore a transformation of the hosting and use   of regulatory data over the next decade. This review will be conducted in close consultation with   banks, insurers and financial market infrastructures. We are also embarking on proofs of concepts,   in collaboration with firms and the tech sector, to test how we can automatically extract regulatory   firm data. And we will identify and implement near term improvements in how we use data, including   greater use of AI and ML to interpret the information.    Support the transition to a carbon-neutral economy    My final example of how the new finance can serve the new economy is the most fundamental.    Indeed, it is existential.    This year, the threats from climate change spurred demonstrations across the country and prompted   Parliament to declare a �climate emergency�. In response, last week, the Prime Minister announced   legislation that would make the UK the first G7 country to commit to net zero emissions by 2050.    The changes required to achieve this are enormous. Carbon emissions will have to decline by 45% from   2010 levels over the next decade.26 This will require a massive reallocation of capital creating   unprecedented risks and opportunities. As one example, it is estimated that annual investment in   sustainable infrastructure could top �20 billion for decades. 27    Firms that align their business models to the transition to a carbon-neutral world will be rewarded   handsomely; those that fail to adapt will cease to exist.    The new finance can smooth the transition to a carbon-neutral economy.    The City has been leading the way. UK underwriters, led by the former Lord Mayor Sir Roger Gifford, helped   create the green bond market which has doubled every year since 2012 to reach $500bn outstanding.28 UK-   based banks, like Barclays and HSBC, insurers, like Aviva, and asset managers, like Generation, helped   develop climate financial disclosure standards and were amongst the TCFD�s first adopters. Now a range of   firms at the heart of the City are beginning to reshape the management of climate-related risks and   opportunities.    But we must go much further if the UK is to reach net zero carbon emissions. Disclosure must become   comprehensive. Risk management must be transformed. Sustainable investing must go mainstream.    26      See: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/790626/2018-provisional-   emissions-statistics-report.pdf.   27      See: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/703816/green-finance-   taskforce-accelerating-green-finance-report.pdf.   28      Source: Climate Bonds Initiative Data.                                                                                                                                      10     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                10   Fortunately, the momentum is growing.    Four years ago in the run-up to the Paris Climate accord, the Bank called for improved financial disclosure of   climate-related financial risks in order to break the Tragedy of the Horizon.29 Just two years ago, the TCFD   led by Michael Bloomberg made its final recommendations to the G20 Leaders Summit in Hamburg.30 Since   then there has been a step change in climate reporting by the private sector.    On the demand side, current supporters of the TCFD control balance sheets totalling $120 trillion and include   the world�s top banks, asset managers, pension funds, insurers, credit rating agencies, accounting firms and   shareholder advisory services.31    On the supply side, the TCFD report published last week showed that four fifths of the 1100 G20 companies   surveyed were now disclosing climate-related financial risks and three quarters of users of the information   had seen a marked improvement in the quality of disclosures.32    In the future, to achieve a carbon-neutral economy, disclosure must become mandatory. Before it does, we   need to get it right. Over the next few years, the current iterative process of disclosure, reaction and   adjustment will be critical to ensure that these market standards are as comparable, efficient and decision-   useful as possible.    Disclosure is just the start. Analysis needs to go beyond the static to the strategic. The nature of climate   risks mean that the biggest challenge is in assessing the resilience of firms� strategies to transition risks.    Transition risks result from the huge adjustments required to create a low-carbon economy. Changes in   policies, technologies and physical risks will prompt a reassessment of the value of a large range of assets   as new costs and opportunities become apparent. The longer meaningful adjustment is delayed, the more   transition risks will rise.

The LGA supports councils   across the country as they deliver local solutions to national problems, helping them to build the skills they   need and ensuring the voice of local government is heard at the national level.    My only regret is not being able to enjoy the beaches for which Bournemouth is rightly famous. The closest I   will get is using a nautical analogy � a sea change.    A sea change is a profound transformation. The term was originally coined by Shakespeare in The Tempest,   of which there are five productions across Dorset this summer.1 These productions will mix tragedy and   comedy in a play whose themes range from magic and creation to betrayal and revenge.    My focus is more limited and prosaic � but also more immediately relevant to your work. In recent months,   there has been a sea change in financial markets driven by growing concerns over the global economic   outlook. I will assess these global developments before turning to what they may mean for the UK�s   economic prospects.    Global financial market developments    In recent months, the expected paths of policy interest rates in advanced economies have shifted sharply   lower, most notably in the US where an expectation of two further rate hikes over the next three years has   flipped to four rate cuts by the end of next year. In the euro area, markets have begun to price in further rate   reductions and asset purchases (Chart 1 and the charts in the annex).

It appears in a song sung by Ariel, to Ferdinand, a prince of   Naples, after Ferdinand's father's apparent death by drowning: Full fathom five thy father lies, / Of his bones are coral made, / Those   are pearls that were his eyes, / Nothing of him that doth fade, / but doth suffer a sea-change, / into something rich and strange, / Sea-   nymphs hourly ring his knell, / Ding-dong. / Hark! now I hear them, ding-dong, bell.                                                                                                                                           2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                     2   Long-term government bond yields have fallen sharply in tandem (Chart 2), with US 10-year yields their   lowest in two and a half years, 10 year gilt yields their lowest since the immediate aftermath of the   referendum, and German 10-year bund yields their lowest ever. $13 trillion of global investment-grade debt   is now trading at negative yields. Lower discount rates have provided substantial support to equity prices,   which are near all-time highs in the US despite an economic outlook that is becoming less robust and more   uncertain.

The global outlook    These market developments reflect a sea change driven by growing concerns over the impact of rising trade   tensions and policy uncertainty.    Certainly the portents are worrying. The storm that the modern Prospero has conjured is having an impact.    Over the past year, the global economy has shifted from a robust, broad-based expansion to a widespread   slowdown, with the proportion of the global economy growing above trend falling from four fifths to one sixth.    In its May Inflation Report, the MPC projected that global growth would soon stabilise before recovering to   around its potential rate by the middle of next year. This reflected:      i)     the relative absence of fundamental imbalances in the global economy that would by themselves be            expected to derail the expansion;     ii)    a considerable degree of expected policy support to the expansion; and     iii)   some positive momentum in trade discussions.                                                                                                                   3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                           3   On 5 May, with the ink on the MPC�s Report barely dry, President Trump announced further increases in   tariffs on imports from China and China retaliated. Later that month, the US additionally threatened new   tariffs on Mexico despite having only recently agreed a revised NAFTA accord. The US threat to increase   tariffs on auto imports from Europe remains.    The latest actions raise the possibility that trade tensions could be far more pervasive, persistent and   damaging than previously expected. The rationales for action are broadening. Initially motivated by   concerns over bilateral trade imbalances, trade measures are now being taken in response to issues ranging   from immigration to Intellectual Property protection to control of the technologies underpinning the Fourth   Industrial Revolution.2 It has even become fashionable for some to speak of a new Cold War.    That bears a moment�s reflection for a lot has changed. At the height of the Cold War, US-USSR trade was   worth $2 billion a year; today, US-Chinese trade clocks $2 billion a day. More broadly trade in intermediate   goods and services has doubled since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and production has become increasingly   integrated across borders.3    The longer current tensions persist, the greater the risk that protectionism becomes the norm. Once raised,   tariffs are usually slow to be lowered. Consider that half a century ago the US imposed tariffs on light trucks   due to a dispute over chicken exports to Europe. While the chickens were soon forgotten, the truck tariffs   remain in place.    Reflecting the more febrile atmosphere, a trade war has shot to the top of the risks most worrying investors   (Chart 3) and measures of global economic policy uncertainty have reached record highs (Chart 4).    Such concerns are contributing to sharp reductions in corporate earnings expectations (Chart 5), though for   the time being the falls in expected policy rates have cushioned the impact on equity prices. The markets�   faith in the power of monetary policy is notable.    Business confidence has fallen across the G7 to its lowest level in five years (Chart 6a) with sentiment   among manufacturers particularly weak. Households have also become gloomier about the general   economic outlook, though they remain relatively upbeat about their own financial situation (Chart 6b), likely   reflecting robust labour markets. This is a similar pattern to that which emerged in the UK following the   referendum.       2     In mid-May, the US placed Chinese company Huawei on its �entity list�, in effect banning US companies from selling to it without US   government. China retaliated, publishing its own list of unreliable entities at the end of that month.   3     Trade in intermediate goods and services doubled between 1989 and 2014 and the value added of imports as a share of exports rose   from 10% in 1990 to around 20% in 2015.

Notes: The chart shows the median across the G7 euro area countries (France, Germany and Italy) and the US.      Reconciling market moves with global developments    All in all, the risks to the global economy have shifted to the downside. But to what extent? Does the sea   change in financial markets presage a sea change in the global economic outlook? And what does the UK   experience suggest?    A lot will rest on the scale and breadth of the trade effects.    Traditional trade models suggest that the direct effects of the tariff measures implemented so far4 are likely   to be small. The Bank estimates that these measures will reduce global GDP by only around 0.1%, and the   further US-China tariffs that took effect in May and June will roughly double that effect (Table 1).5    But that may not be the end of the story. The additional tariffs threatened by the US on China and on auto   imports more generally would raise average US tariffs to rates not seen in half a century (Table 2). If   implemented, they could reduce global GDP by an additional 0.6% through direct trade channels alone   (Table 1).       4       US tariffs on steel and aluminium and the reciprocated 25% tariff on $50bn of US imports from China.   5       The hit to global GDP may be cushioned somewhat by trade diversion, which will likely benefit non-China Asian EMEs.                                                                                                                                    7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                             7   Table 1: Direct effects of tariff increases small but indirect effects potentially far greater                                                                              Change in level of GDP (%)                                                                                                                     World                                                            US          China       Euro area         UK         (PPP-weighted)   Measures taken in previous years                         -0.4         -0.3           -0.1          -0.1             -0.1   Additional US-China tariffs implemented                  -0.5         -0.4           -0.2          -0.1             -0.2   in May and June 2019   Additional marginal reduction in GDP in the event that�         US-China raise tariffs on all imports              -0.5         -0.5           -0.1          -0.1             -0.2         to 25%         US imposes 25% tariffs on all auto                 -1.2         -0.3           -0.3          -0.2             -0.4         imports and all countries reciprocate   Total if all measures are implemented                    -2.1         -1.2           -0.6          -0.4             -0.8    Sources: Bank calculations.

Notes: Measures already implemented are the US tariffs on steel and aluminium and the reciprocated 25% tariff on $250bn of US   imports from China. Contemplated measures are 25% US tariffs on all imports from China and retaliatory measures and the US tariffs   on EU motor vehicles and parts.     Moreover, these estimates may underestimate the non-linear effects of tariffs on tightly integrated global   supply chains.    In this regard, the early indications are not promising. The more hostile and uncertain trading environment is   coinciding with sharp slowdowns in global trade, manufacturing, industrial production and capital goods   orders (Chart 7).    As a consequence, the quality of global growth has deteriorated. Across the G7, the growth rate of business   investment has almost halved since its peak in late 2017, leaving the global expansion more reliant on   consumer spending (Chart 8) and reducing its resilience.6       6    BIS analysis finds that increasing shares of private consumption in GDP can be a leading indicator of future growth slowdowns. The   work suggests a number of possible mechanisms: consumption that is financed by debt could mean that subsequent spending is more   constrained; households may choose to consume from equity gains related to house price rises during expansions but may need to cut   spending if those rises reverse; and a lack of investment opportunities could also play a role, weak investment and associated weak   GDP growth could show up as consumption-led growth, not least because consumption is stickier.

Notes: Growth in real purchasing power parity (PPP)-weighted GDP.      As the experience of Brexit has shown, the indirect effects of trade tensions on business confidence and   investment can be much more material than the direct effects alone.    UK business investment has flat-lined since the referendum, underperforming both previous recoveries and   the international experience (Charts 9a and 9b). There is also evidence that these uncertainty effects are   holding back foreign direct investment in the UK.7    The UK�s experience can be used to assess the extent to which the deteriorating trade outlook can explain   the sea change in financial markets.       7     Data from the Department for International Trade indicate that the number of new FDI projects in the UK in 2018/19 fell to its lowest   level in five years.                                                                                                                                             10     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                       10   Chart 9a: UK business investment underperformed compared with previous recoveries�                                                                                             Indices: peak in GDP = 100                                                                                                                    180                                                                                                                           160                                                                                                                           140                  Range of previous recessions                                                                             120                                                                                                                           100                                                                                       EU                                                                                       Referendum                                                                                       Act                                80                  2008                                                                                                                          60     0            5           10         15         20         25        30                    35           40                                    Quarters since pre-recession peak in GDP   Sources: ONS and Bank calculations   Notes: Chained?volume measure.

These galleries testify to the UK�s   rich history of discovery in science, technology and industry.    A little more than eight months ago, the Bank sought to recognise the UK�s extraordinary scientific heritage   by asking people across the country to �Think Science� in order to help us choose the character to feature on   the new �50 note.    We were overwhelmed by the response. In six weeks, almost a quarter of a million nominations were   submitted, from which we distilled a very long list of nearly 1,000 unique characters.1    The hard work of narrowing down these names to a shortlist of twelve options required the incomparable   knowledge and tireless work of the Banknote Character Advisory Committee.2 On behalf of the Bank, I   would like to thank the external members of the Advisory Committee � Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, Dr Emily   Grossman, Professor Simon Schaffer, Dr Simon Singh, Professor Sir David Cannadine, Sandy Nairne and   Baroness Lola Young � for their invaluable expert advice and unbridled enthusiasm.    The characters that made it through to the final shortlist were:         ?     Mary Anning        ?     Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace        ?     Paul Dirac        ?     Rosalind Franklin        ?     Stephen Hawking        ?     Caroline Herschel and William Herschel        ?     Dorothy Hodgkin        ?     James Clerk Maxwell        ?     Srinivasa Ramanujan        ?     Ernest Rutherford        ?     Frederick Sanger        ?     Alan Turing    The shortlist epitomises the breadth and depth of scientific achievement in the UK. Their work covers both   the theoretical and the practical, and spans from the smallest building blocks of the universe to the nature of   life itself.       1     Characters must be non-fictional and deceased. We also need to ensure that a suitable, easy to recognise, portrait of the person is   available.   2     https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/people/banknote-character-advisory-committee.                                                                                                                                           2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                    2   Rosalind Franklin�s and Frederik Sanger�s revelations about DNA, for example, furthered our understanding   of the biology of life, and Dorothy Hodgkin�s discoveries about the structure of insulin and vitamins better   enabled us to preserve it. Mary Anning�s palaeontological discoveries helped us understand the history of   life on earth, while Caroline and William Herschel and Stephen Hawking opened up the heavens.    Srinivasa Ramanujan�s pioneering research transformed modern theoretical mathematics. More practicably,   the ground-breaking work of James Clerk Maxwell, Ernest Rutherford and Paul Dirac on electromagnetism,   radiation and quantum mechanics laid the foundations for telecommunications and nuclear physics.   Likewise, Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace have contributed to the origins of computing that underpins   virtually every aspect of modern life.    Each of the shortlisted scientists is worthy of celebration, so the Bank is delighted that this Museum is   honouring them with a special exhibition that showcases their many and diverse achievements.    Sadly, there is not adequate space to feature them all on the new �50 note. A choice had to be made.    And it is my pleasure to announce today that the scientist that will feature on the new �50 note is Alan   Turing.    Why Turing?    Alan Turing was an outstanding mathematician whose work has had an enormous impact on how we live   today. As the father of computer science and artificial intelligence, Alan Turing�s contributions were far   ranging and path breaking.    Turing was insatiably curious about the world around him. With his mind ranging widely and freely, he   approached a variety of seemingly intractable problems and found answers that passed others by. His   genius lay in his unique ability to link the philosophical and abstract with the practical and concrete.    All around us, his legacy continues to build. Turing is a giant on whose shoulders so many now stand.    Born in Paddington, London on 23 June 1912, Turing displayed prodigious talent and vibrant interest in the   sciences and mathematics as a schoolboy. This was reinforced by the untimely death of his close friend   Christopher Morcom. Writing to Morcom�s mother, he declared, �I know I must put as much energy if not as   much interest into my work as if he were alive, because that is what he would like me to do.�                                                                                                                      3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                           3   To many, Turing is renowned for his �indispensable�3 codebreaking contributions at Bletchley Park during the   Second World War.4 The advances Turing made in cryptanalysis then � including co-inventing the Bombe   computer for solving ciphers and applying statistical techniques to speed up rates of decryption � were   pivotal in cracking the hitherto unbreakable German Enigma code. Turing�s work gave the Allies a crucial   advantage in the battle for the Atlantic and is widely credited with hastening the end of the war by at least   two years, potentially saving millions of lives in the process.    That alone would be more than enough for one lifetime, but Turing�s contributions range far more broadly   than those that have been rightly celebrated in print and on screen.    One of Turing�s lesser-known interests was biology. In later life, Turing pioneered morphogenesis by   applying his knowledge of mathematics and computer science to understand how plants and microorganisms   develop their shapes and patterns. Turing used computers to simulate the results of hypothetical chemical   reactions to develop truly original insights in this field. The theoretical foundations he developed have since   been applied to solve puzzles such as why the leaflets on a pinecone follow the Fibonacci sequence and to   explain the pattern of animals� coats from cats to zebras. This work of a lifetime helped lay a cornerstone in   theoretical biology.    It was, however, the workings of the human mind that inspired Turing�s greatest contributions to human   knowledge and our lived experience. Turing answered a fundamental question: whether there is a definitive   method that could be applied by machine to solve all mathematical problems. Once again, Turing�s genius   lay in his ability to think across boundaries, applying mathematical logic to a problem others had viewed as   one of physics. The answer he supplied � captured in his 1936 paper On Computable Numbers5 � provides   the very foundations of computer science.    Turing envisaged a machine that could be turned to any well-defined task by supplying it with the appropriate   program. The eponymous Universal Turing Machine, fed instructions through symbols on an infinite piece of   tape, was an abstract concept in his time, but it�s something that recognisably embodies the core principles   of a modern computer and the logic of binary code. Moreover, his insight that only computable functions can   be calculated is vital to software design. In recognition of the importance of this work, Turing was elected a   Fellow of the Royal Society in 1951.    Enough for two lifetimes.       3     Cryptographic History of Work on the German Naval Enigma, by C H O'D Alexander, a colleague of Turing�s at Bletchley. See:   http://www.ellsbury.com/gne/gne-042.htm.   4     In 1946, King George VI appointed Turing an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his wartime services, although the details of   his work remained secret for many years.   5     Turing, A (1936), �On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem�, Proceedings of the London   Mathematical Society, Volume 42, Issue 1, pp. 230-265.                                                                                                                                          4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                     4   Having imagined the concept of a computer, Turing helped turn it into reality. He played a vital role in the   design and development of early electronic computers after the war, continuing to contribute key ideas such   as implementing functions by flexible programing rather than pre-set built-in electronic components. Working   first at the National Physical Laboratory in London and later at the Computing Machine Laboratory at   Manchester University, his insights led to the creation of the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) in 1950 and   the program for Ferranti Mark 1, the world�s first commercially available electronic computer.    A visionary as well as a revolutionary, Turing recognised that �This is only a foretaste of what is to come and   only the shadow of what is going to be�.    True to his nature, Turing himself began to suggest some possible directions.    His interests in neurology and physiology led him to ask whether computing machines could be capable of   mimicking the faculties of the human mind, including the ability to learn. His work prefigured the neural   networks that are used today in applications such as cancer diagnosis and self-driving cars and as yet   undiscovered new technologies of tomorrow. And the Turing Test, a method for determining whether a   computer can exhibit intelligent behaviour indistinguishable from a human being, remains the benchmark for   judging true artificial intelligence.    Turing also leaves a very different, though no less important, legacy. In March 1952, he was convicted of   Gross Indecency for his private relationship with a man, avoiding prison only by submitting to chemical   castration. His security clearance was revoked for no reason other than his homosexuality, bringing to an   end a promising post-war career as a consultant for GCHQ. He died shortly thereafter, on 7 June 1954, from   cyanide poisoning.    In 2009, the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official posthumous apology on behalf of the   �government and all those who live freely thanks to Turing�s work� for his �utterly unfair� treatment.6 Turing   received a royal pardon for his conviction in December 2013 and in 2017 the �Alan Turing Law� was passed,   pardoning the nearly 50,000 men cautioned or convicted under now-rescinded historical legislation that   outlawed homosexual acts.    In the UK today, we are fortunate to live in more inclusive times. Thanks to groups like the Sexual Law   Reform Society and Stonewall, and initiatives like Pride, there has been huge progress towards ending the   unfair treatment of people on the basis of sexual orientation and creating a society in which everyone can be   their true selves without fear or favour.7      6     See https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091005104048/   http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20571   7     The Bank of England aims to be an LGBT+ inclusive employer, taking part in the London Pride parade every year and flying the pride   flag atop its Threadneedle Street building. The Bank has a thriving LGBT+ & Allies Network which was launched in 2006 and now has   around 350 members and allies. In 2018, the Bank supported the rollout of rainbow lanyards in the spirit of creating a visibly inclusive   and supportive environment � these are now worn by more than 1,000 colleagues. We complete the Stonewall benchmarking exercise   each year and were pleased to have increased our ranking by over 100 places in 2018.                                                                                                                                         5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                   5   The Bank of England is committed to ensuring our banknotes are as inclusive as possible. That means   celebrating the breadth of human achievement in this great country from science to the arts to statecraft to   literature. And it means featuring a range of individuals who reflect the vibrant diversity of UK society.    The design of the note    Let me conclude by unveiling the image for the new Turing �50 note.    The design recognises the breadth and variety of Turing�s contributions to science. The table taken from his   seminal paper On Computable Numbers in the foreground is a succinct representation of a Turing Machine,   and the ticker tape records Turing�s birth date in binary code.    In the background are images of the ACE pilot machine and a section from the technical drawings of the   Bombe.    The portrait is by Elliott and Fry, and the quote is from an interview published in The Times, dated 11 June   1949.                                                         ********    The characters on our banknotes celebrate those who have advanced British thought, spurred innovation,   shown exceptional leadership, shaped this diverse society and forged our common values. Alan Turing will   join Winston Churchill on the �5 note and Jane Austen on the �10, and JMW Turner who will make his   appearance on the new �20 next year.    Although we look to history when we chose a new character, Turing�s work inspires us to look to the future   and imagine what is still to come as a result of his genius.    If anyone can see the future, it�s the next speaker. It is my pleasure to welcome Demis Hassabis � artificial   intelligence researcher, neuroscientist, video game designer, chess champion, co-founder of DeepMind and   one of the 225,000 who submitted a recommendation to this process � to celebrate Turing�s past   contributions to science and venture where they might take us tomorrow.                                                                                                                      6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                           6
2019-08-27	"The Growing Challenges for Monetary Policy in the current   International Monetary and Financial System   Speech given by   Mark Carney   Governor of the Bank of England     Jackson Hole Symposium 2019   23 August 2019       I am grateful to Clare Macallan, Daisy McGregor and James Benford for their assistance in preparing   these remarks, and to Nishat Anjum, Ambrogio Cesa-Bianchi, Alex Haberis, James O�Connor and   Carlos van Hombeeck for background research and analysis.                                                                                                          1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches   Introduction    Before turning to the focus of my remarks, I would like to begin with a few comments on the UK outlook.    A snapshot suggests the UK economy is currently close to equilibrium, operating just below   potential with inflation just above its target.    Both headline and core inflation are around 2%, and domestic price pressures have been picking up notably.   In particular, the labour market is tight. Growth in wages and unit wage costs have strengthened   considerably as slack has been absorbed, with both now running at their highest rates in over a decade.   The strength of the labour market is supporting consumer spending, which is rising broadly in line with real   incomes.    But pictures can deceive; two large, volatile forces could push the UK economy far from balance.    Until the start of this year, the UK economy had been growing around its trend rate. Since then, the   intensification of Brexit uncertainties and weaker global activity have weighed heavily on UK activity.    Global momentum remains soft, despite the broad-based easing in monetary policy expectations. In part this   reflects a significant spike in economic policy uncertainty and the related risk that protectionism could prove   more pervasive, persistent and damaging than previously expected. As I will discuss in a moment, these   headwinds are now restraining business investment globally and could push down on the global equilibrium   interest rate, exacerbating concerns about limited monetary policy space.    Long-term government bond yields have fallen sharply alongside the falls in expected policy rates. US 10-   year yields are near three-year lows, and 10-year gilt yields and German 10-year bund yields are their lowest   ever. Around $16 trillion of global debt is now trading at negative yields.    As material as these global developments are, the UK outlook hinges on the nature and timing of Brexit.    The UK economy contracted slightly last quarter and surveys point to stagnation in this one. Looking   through Brexit-related volatility, it is likely that underlying growth is positive but muted.    The biggest economic headwind is weak business investment, which has stagnated over the past few years,   despite limited spare capacity, robust balance sheets, supportive financial conditions and a highly   competitive exchange rate. There is overwhelming evidence that this is a direct result of uncertainties over   the UK�s future trading relationship with the EU, and it serves as a warning to others of the potential impact   of persistent trade tensions on global business confidence and activity.    The UK economy could follow multiple possible paths depending on how Brexit progresses with   material implications for the stance of monetary policy.    In recent weeks, the perceived likelihood of No Deal has risen sharply as evidenced by betting odds and   financial market asset pricing (the UK now has the highest FX implied volatility, the highest equity risk   premium and lowest real yields of any advanced economy).    In the event of a No Deal No Transition Brexit, sterling would probably fall, pushing up inflation, and demand   would weaken further, reflecting lost trade access, heightened uncertainty and tighter financial conditions.    Unusually for an advanced economy slowdown, there would also be a large, immediate hit to supply. The   Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would need to assess to what extent that reflects temporary disruption to                                                                                                               2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                          2   production, with limited implications for inflation in the medium term, or a fundamental destruction of supply   capacity because of the abrupt change in the UK�s economic relationship with the EU.    As the MPC has repeatedly emphasised, the monetary policy response to No Deal would not be automatic   but would depend on the balance of these effects � on demand, supply and the exchange rate � on medium   term inflationary pressures. In my view, the appropriate policy path would be more likely to ease than not,   using the flexibility in the MPC�s remit to lengthen the period over which inflation is returned to target. But   much would depend on the exact nature of No Deal and its impact. In the end, monetary policy can only   help smooth the adjustment to the major real shock that an abrupt No Deal Brexit would entail, but even its   ability to do that would be constrained by the limits to the MPC�s tolerance of above target inflation.    While the possibility of No Deal has increased, it is not a given. Along another path, it is possible that   domestic political events or negotiations with the EU could lead to a longer period of uncertainty over the   eventual future relationship, even in the event that an agreement is struck. On past performance, the longer   these uncertainties persist, the more likely it is that growth will remain below potential raising the prospect of   both softer domestically generated inflation and resurgent imported inflation if recent sterling weakness were   to endure. Once again, the MPC would need to weigh the opposing forces when setting policy.    Finally, some form of agreement remains possible. After all, that is the avowed preference of both the UK   and EU. In this event, consistent with the MPC�s most recent projections, as details of the future relationship   gradually emerge, business investment recovers and household spending picks up, resulting in excess   demand and inflationary pressures gradually building. In the Committee�s judgment, this path for the   economy would likely require limited and gradual interest rate increases.    The coming months could be decisive. If there are material Brexit developments, the MPC will transparently   assess their implications and set policy to achieve the 2% inflation target in a sustainable manner.    I. Challenges for Monetary Policy in the current IMFS    When Ben Bernanke was retiring from the Fed, his closing remarks to central bank governors at the BIS set   us the task of sorting out the deep flaws in the international monetary and financial system (�IMFS�). Six   years later, with my demise as governor on the horizon, I�m going to �pay it forward� by focusing on how the   nature of the IMFS challenges monetary policy.    For decades, the mainstream view has been that countries can achieve price stability and minimise   excessive output variability by adopting flexible inflation targeting and floating exchange rates. The gains   from policy coordination were thought to be modest at best, and the prescription was for countries to keep   their houses in order.1    This consensus is increasingly untenable for several reasons. Globalisation has steadily increased the   impact of international developments on all our economies. This in turn has made any deviations from the   core assumptions of the canonical view even more critical. In particular, growing dominant currency pricing   (DCP) is reducing the shock absorbing properties of flexible exchange rates and altering the inflation-output   volatility trade-off facing monetary policy makers. And most fundamentally, a destabilising asymmetry at the   heart of the IMFS is growing. While the world economy is being reordered, the US dollar remains as   important as when Bretton Woods collapsed (Figure 1).      1    This view is summarised in a speech by John Murray, �With a Little Help from Your Friends: The Virtues of Global Economic   Coordination�, 29 November 2011.                                                                                                                                3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                         3   The combination of these factors means that US developments have significant spillovers onto both the trade   performance and the financial conditions of countries even with relatively limited direct exposure to the US   economy.    These dynamics are now increasing the risks of a global liquidity trap. In particular, the IMFS is structurally   lowering the global equilibrium interest rate, r*, by:        -    feeding a global savings glut, as EMEs defensively accumulate reserves of safe US dollar assets            against the backdrop of an inadequate and fragmented global financial safety net;        -    reducing the scale of sustainable cross border flows, and as a result lowering the rate of global            potential growth; and        -    fattening of the left-hand tail and increasing the downside skew of likely economic outcomes.    In an increasingly integrated world, global r* exerts a greater influence on domestic r*.2 As the global   equilibrium rate falls, it becomes more difficult for domestic monetary policy makers everywhere to provide   the stimulus necessary to achieve their objectives.    These dynamics are directly relevant to the current risks of a global slowdown. At present, there are   relatively few fundamental imbalances in terms of capacity constraints or indebtedness that would of   themselves portend a recession.3 However, the combination of structural imbalances at the heart of the   IMFS itself and protectionism are threatening global momentum.    The amplification of spillovers by the IMFS matters less when the global expansions are relatively   synchronised or when the US economy is relatively weak. But when US conditions warrant tighter policy   there than elsewhere, the strains in the system become evident.    These conditions emerged last year. US fiscal policy had boosted growth at a time when the US economy   was near full employment. US monetary policy had to tighten consistent with the Fed�s dual mandate. The   resulting dollar strength and financial spillovers tightened financial conditions in most other economies by   more than was warranted by their domestic conditions (two thirds of the global economy was growing at   below potential rates at the start of 2019, and that proportion has since risen to five sixths). More recently,   the dramatic increase in trade tensions (Chart 1) has reinforced their effects by increasing risk premia.    Today, the combination of heightened economic policy uncertainty (Chart 2), outright protectionism and   concerns that further, negative shocks could not be adequately offset because of limited policy space is   exacerbating the disinflationary bias in the global economy.    What then must be done?    In the short term, central bankers must play the cards they have been dealt as best they can.    That means using the full flexibility in flexible inflation targeting. To retain the essential credibility of their   frameworks, this is best done transparently with central bankers explaining their reasons for targeting   specific trade-offs between price stability and output volatility.      2     See �[De]Globalisation and Inflation�, 2017 IMF Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture given by Mark Carney, 18 September   2017.   3     See �The Global Outlook�, speech by Mark Carney, 12 February 2019.                                                                                                                                   4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                            4   Those at the core of the IMFS need to incorporate spillovers and spill backs, as the Fed has been doing.   More broadly, central banks need to develop a better shared understanding of the scale of global risks and   their consequences for monetary policy.    We cannot all export our way out of these challenges. In a global liquidity trap, there are gains from   coordination, and other policies � particularly fiscal � have clear roles to play. And acting earlier and more   forcefully will increase their effectiveness.    In the medium term, policymakers need to reshuffle the deck.    That is, we need to improve the structure of the current IMFS. That requires ensuring that the institutions at   the heart of market-based finance, particularly open-ended funds, are resilient throughout the global financial   cycle. It requires better surveillance of cross border spillovers to guide macroprudential and, in extremis,   capital flow management measures. And it underscores the premium on re-building an adequate global   financial safety net.    In the longer term, we need to change the game. There should be no illusions that the IMFS can be   reformed overnight or that market forces are likely to force a rapid switch of reserve assets.4 But equally   blithe acceptance of the status quo is misguided. Risks are building, and they are structural. As Rudi   Dornbusch warned, �In economics, things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then they   happen faster than you thought they could�.    When change comes, it shouldn�t be to swap one currency hegemon for another. Any unipolar system is   unsuited to a multi-polar world. We would do well to think through every opportunity, including those   presented by new technologies, to create a more balanced and effective system.    II. Growing Challenges in the Current IMFS    The structure of the current international monetary financial system is making it increasingly difficult for   monetary policy makers to achieve their domestic mandates to stabilise inflation and maintain output at   potential.    According to the mainstream view, these objectives are best achieved through operationally independent   central banks adopting flexible inflation targeting and allowing their exchange rates to float.    That view rests on two pillars. The first is that floating exchange rates are effective absorbers of global   shocks, insulating domestic employment and output from developments abroad. If import prices are fully   flexible and international financial markets are complete, then changes in exchange rates pass through fully   to import prices, and the optimal monetary policy response is to accommodate the effect on inflation, keeping   output close to potential and the price of domestic output stable.5    That leads directly to the second pillar � that there are only modest gains from international policy   cooperation and coordination in such circumstances. This long-standing and widely held view reflects the   4     The analysis of Gita Gopinath, Emmanuel Farhi, Matteo Maggiori and Jeremy Stein, amongst others, emphasises the persistence in   the structure of the current IMFS.   5     See Corsetti, G, Dedola, L, and Leduc, S (2010), �Optimal Monetary Policy in Open Economies�, Handbook of Monetary Economics,   Vol. 3, Chapter 16, pp. 861-933; and Benigno, G and Benigno, P (2006), �Designing targeting rules for international monetary policy   cooperation�, Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol. 53(3), pp. 473-506. In the standard welfare-based analyses of optimal monetary   policy in an open economy, a key consideration is the extent to which sticky prices in different currencies lead to deviations from the law   of one price (LOOP) for different goods. The first-best (efficient) outcome is for goods to sell for the same price when converted into   different currencies. If this is not the case, demand is misaligned internationally, which in turn creates an inefficient allocation of factor   inputs. Under PCP, the full flexibility of import prices means the exchange rate can act as an efficient shock absorber, adjusting to   ensure that the LOOP holds.                                                                                                                                             5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                         5   beliefs that any externalities that might exist are almost trivially small and that trying to address them would   be fine-tuning to the nth degree.    The mainstream view is increasingly anachronistic for several reasons.    First and foremost, international linkages have risen dramatically over the past few decades, increasing the   importance of cross border spillovers.6    Growing cross border trade means external demand has greater effects on domestic resource allocation and   therefore inflation. The integration of low-cost producers into the global economy has imparted a steady   disinflationary bias through its direct effect on prices. The expansion in global value chains has increased   the synchronisation of producer prices across countries. Financial linkages have increased leading to a   faster and more powerful transmission of shocks across countries. And globalisation has increased the   contestability of markets, weakening the extent to which slack in domestic labour markets influences   domestic inflationary pressures.7    Second, the changing nature of trade invoicing is affecting import price pass through and changing the   inflation-output volatility trade-off facing monetary policy makers.    Dominant currency pricing is widespread (partly due to the growth of supply chains), leading to deviations   from the law of one price and misalignments in countries� terms of trade.8 The dollar represents the currency   of choice for at least half of international trade invoices, around five times greater than the US�s share in   world goods imports, and three times its share in world exports.9    The resulting stickiness of import prices in dollar terms means exchange rate pass-through for changes in   the dollar is high regardless of the country of export and import, while pass-through of non-dominant   currencies is negligible. As a result, import prices do not adjust efficiently to reflect changes in relative   demand between trading partners, in part because expenditure switching effects are curtailed,10 and global   trade volumes are heavily influenced by the strength of the US dollar.11    This is less of a problem when all boats are rising with the global tide of synchronised growth. But when the   tide is rising in America while receding elsewhere, those authorities face more difficult trade-offs between   price stability and output volatility � a situation that could create large potential gains from policy coordination   that independent policymakers would not address.    6     World trade as a share of global GDP has doubled since 1970. Over the past two decades, 80% of the increase in total trade has   come from intermediates goods trade, driving up the value added of imports as a share from 10% of exports in 1990 to around 20% in   2015. Cross-holding of countries� assets and liabilities increased almost fourfold since 1990, and measures of stock market integration   are at their highest ever (see Bastidon, C, Bordo, M, Parent, A, and Weidenmier, M (2019), �Towards an Unstable Hook: The Evolution   of Stock Market Integration Since 1913�, NBER Working Paper No. 26166.   7     For more detail on these changes, see �[De]Globalisation and Inflation�, ibid.   8     Dominant currency pricing refers to the widespread use of a single currency � the US dollar � in trade invoicing, in place of the   currency of either the producer or the importer. Import prices will therefore depend on changes in the bilateral exchange rate between   the local and the dominant currency, rather than that between the local and producer currency. For evidence, see Goldberg, L and Tille,   C (2009), �Macroeconomic interdependence and the international role of the dollar�, Journal of Monetary Economics, 56 (7), pp. 990-   1003; and Gopinath, G(2016). �The International Price System,� Jackson Hole Symposium Proceedings.   9     Gopinath (2016), ibid, and Ito, H, and Kawai, M (2016), �Trade Invoicing in Major Currencies in the 1970s-1990s: Lessons for   Renminbi Internationalization�, Journal of the Japanese and International Economies, Volume 42, pp. 123�145.   10      For a country with a large share of trade invoiced in dollars, a depreciation against the dollar raises the domestic price of imports,   causing domestic households and firms to switch their expenditure away from foreign goods. But it leaves the (dollar) price of exports in   the markets in which they are sold unchanged, albeit making them more profitable for domestic exporters in terms of home currency.   Because imports would fall straight away and it would take time for the export sector to expand to take advantage of the higher profits, it   is therefore likely that a rebalancing of the economy from imports to exports would be slower than if traded goods were priced in the   currencies of their production. In addition, other things equal, the rise in import prices would lead to a pick-up in imported inflationary   pressure.   11      Boz, Gopinath and Plagborg-Moller (2017) show that a 1% appreciation of the dollar leads, all else equal, to a 0.6% contraction in   trade volumes in the rest of the world.                                                                                                                                          6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                      6   Third, a growing asymmetry at the heart of the IMFS is putting the global economy under increasing strain.    Huge network effects mean the dollar has remained dominant in the IMFS despite the transformation of the   global economy. At the time of the Latin American debt crisis, EMEs made up a little more than one third of   global GDP. Since the last Fed tightening cycle, their share of global activity had risen from around 45% to   60%. By 2030, it is projected to rise to around three quarters.    As well as being the dominant currency for the invoicing and settling of international trade, the US dollar is   the currency of choice for securities issuance and holdings, and reserves of the official sector. Two-thirds of   both global securities issuance and official foreign-exchange reserves are denominated in dollars.12 The   same proportion of EME foreign currency external debt is denominated in dollars13 and the dollar serves as   the monetary anchor in countries accounting for two thirds of global GDP.14    The US dollar�s widespread use in trade invoicing and its increasing prominence in global banking and   finance are mutually reinforcing. With large volumes of trade being invoiced and paid for in dollars, it makes   sense to hold dollar-denominated assets. Increased demand for dollar assets lowers their return, creating an   incentive for firms to borrow in dollars. The liquidity and safety properties encourage this further.15 In turn,   companies with dollar-denominated liabilities have an incentive to invoice in dollars, to reduce the currency   mismatch between their revenues and liabilities. More dollar issuance by non-financial companies and more   dollar funding for local banks makes it wise for central banks to accumulate some dollar reserves.    Given the widespread dominance of the dollar in cross border claims, it is not surprising that developments in   the US economy, by affecting the dollar exchange rate, can have large spillover effects to the rest of the   world via asset markets. As H�l�ne Rey has put it,16 and as Arvind Krisnamurthy and Hanno Lustig echo in   their paper for this symposium, the global financial cycle is a dollar cycle.    In part, that arises because movements in the US dollar significantly affect the real burden of debt for those   companies (especially in EMEs) that have borrowed unhedged in dollars, and tend to reduce the dollar value   of companies� collateral.17 Both result in tighter credit conditions and, in the extreme, defaults.    Fluctuations in the dollar also significantly affect the risk appetite of global investors. As discussed by   ?ebnem Kalemli-�zcan earlier today, these risk spillovers can have a significant impact on receiving   economies, especially in EMEs where global risk perceptions interact with country-specific risks.    For EMEs, this manifests in volatile capital flows that amplify domestic imbalances and leave them more   vulnerable to foreign shocks (Charts 3 and 4). One fifth of all surges in capital flows to EMEs have ended in   financial crises, and EMEs are at least three times more likely to experience a financial crisis after capital   flow surges than in normal times.18 While the typical EME receiving higher capital inflows will grow 0.3      12      Gopinath, G and Stein, JC (2018), �Banking, Trade, and the Making of a Dominant Currency�, Working paper, Harvard University.

Bank analysis finds that, for EMEs as a whole, reforms to these domestic institutional �pull� factors have   substantially increased the sustainability of capital flows, all else equal (Chart 5).20    But unfortunately for EMEs, all else is not equal. Their efforts have not been sufficient because of the   consequences of the growing asymmetry between the importance of the US dollar in the global financial   system and the increasingly multi-polar nature of global economic activity.    Monetary policy and financial stability shocks in advanced economies have become more prevalent and   more potent, increasing the importance of �push� factors in driving capital flows. Bank research suggests   that the spillover from tightening in US monetary policy to foreign GDP is now twice its 1990-2004 average,   despite the US�s rapidly declining share of global GDP.    Financial instability in advanced economies also causes capital to retrench from EMEs to �safe havens�, as it   did during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2011 euro-area crisis (Chart 6). Connally�s dictum �our dollar,   your problem� has broadened to �any of our problems is your problem�.    Moreover, the structure of the global financial system � or the �pipes� � is increasingly amplifying capital   outflows from EMEs when these push shocks occur. For EMEs, market-based finance has accounted for all   the increase in foreign lending since the crisis, as bank lending has declined and FDI has stayed fairly   constant (Chart 7).21 While this shift has brought welcome diversity to the financial system, it also reduces   the sustainability of capital flows, as market-based flows are particularly sensitive to changes in global risk   appetite and financial conditions. Investment fund flows are particularly flighty (Chart 8), especially under   stress.    The increasing role of �push� factors and the �pipes� of the system means fast-reforming EMEs could soon   be running to stand still in their quest for more sustainable capital flows (Chart 9). Bank researchers   estimate that the growing shares of FX-denominated debt and market-based finance have increased the   sensitivity of �Capital Flows-at-Risk� to push factors by 50% since the crisis, largely using up the self-   insurance purchased by EMEs.    All told, this means that in the face of foreign shocks, EMEs are forced to compromise their monetary   sovereignty, temporarily diverting monetary policy away from targeting domestic output and inflation and   instead using it to try to stabilise capital flows.    While this strategy is the best EMEs can do given the current structure of the international monetary financial   system, outcomes for them are a distant second best when compared to those advanced economies that are   less exposed to international financial spillovers.      19      See �Pull, Push. Pipes�, speech by Mark Carney, Institute of International Finance Spring Membership Meeting, Tokyo, 6 June 2019.   20      Within the Bank�s Capital Flows-at-Risk framework, these actions are estimated to have Capital Flows-at-Risk (that is, capital outflows   as a percent of GDP in the fifth percentile of the distribution) by 3% of GDP.   21      Within this, investment funds are growing, accounting for the bulk of the growth in asset management over the last decade. In   parallel, investment fund flows to EMEs now account for around one third of total portfolio flows, compared to around one tenth pre-   crisis.                                                                                                                                         8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                     8                                                        -------------------------------    The deficiencies of the IMFS affect EMEs more directly than advanced economies, but their consequences   influence everyone because they reduce the global equilibrium interest rate.    Against the current backdrop of an inadequate and fragmented global financial safety net, EMEs have   chosen to self-insure against capital flow volatility by accumulating reserves of safe assets, contributing to   Ben Bernanke�s �global savings glut�. Given the importance of the US dollar in trade, debt issuance by the   non-financial corporate sector in EMEs, and funding for their domestic banks, most of these reserves are   dollar-denominated.    As well as coming at a domestic high cost to EMEs,22 this vast accumulation of safe assets has pushed   down the global equilibrium interest rate � the rate that central banks must deliver in order to balance   demand with supply and so achieve stable inflation.23    More fundamentally, by making the world a riskier place, the flaws inherent in the IMFS are reinforcing the   downward pressure on global r*.

A new, sustainable financial system is being built.    It is funding the initiatives and innovations of the private sector, it has the potential to amplify the   effectiveness of the climate policies of your governments and it could accelerate the transition to a low   carbon economy.    But the task is large, the window of opportunity is short, and the risks are existential.    And like virtually everything else in the response to climate change, the development of this new sustainable   finance is not moving fast enough for the world to reach net zero.    To bring climate risks and resilience into the heart of financial decision making, climate disclosure must   become comprehensive; climate risk management must be transformed, and sustainable investing must go   mainstream.    Here�s how.    First, on disclosure. Catalysed by the G20 and created by the private sector, the Task Force on   Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) is a comprehensive, practical and flexible framework for   corporate disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities.1    The demand for TCFD disclosure is now enormous. Current supporters control balance sheets totalling   $120 trillion and include the world�s top banks, asset managers, pension funds, insurers, credit rating   agencies, accounting firms and shareholder advisory services.2    The supply of disclosure is responding, with four fifths of over 1100 top G20 companies now disclosing   climate-related financial risks in line with some of the TCFD recommendations, and three quarters of users of   the information seeing a marked improvement in the quality of climate disclosures.3    The next step is to make these disclosures mandatory. The UK and EU have already signalled their intents.4    It�s time for every country to get involved because the world won�t get to net zero if the financial sector   doesn�t know how our companies are responding. In order to watch we must be able to see.      1     Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (June 2017) available at: https://www.fsb-   tcfd.org/wpcontent/uploads/2017/06/FINAL-2017-TCFD-Report-11052018.pdf.   2     Full list of current TCFD supporters available at: https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/tcfdsupporters/.   3     Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures: Status Report (June 2019) available at: https://www.fsb-   tcfd.org/wpcontent/uploads/2019/06/2019-TCFD-Status-Report-FINAL-053119.pdf.   4     The UK has already announced in its Green Finance Strategy published in July 2019 that it expects all listed companies and large asset owners to   report climate risks by 2022. A joint taskforce with UK regulators is considering the most appropriate path to mandatory disclosure. Details available   at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-finance-strategy.                                                                                                                                                     2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                                 2   Over the next two years, the current process of disclosure by the users of capital, reaction by the suppliers of   capital, and adjustment of these standards will be critical to ensure that the TCFD standards are as   comparable, efficient and as decision-useful as possible.    Second, risk management. The providers of capital � banks, insurers, asset managers and those who   supervise them � all need to improve their understanding and management of climate-related financial risks.    Changes in climate policies, new technologies and growing physical risks will prompt reassessments of the   values of virtually every financial asset. Firms that align their business models to the transition to a net zero   world will be rewarded handsomely. Those that fail to adapt will cease to exist. The longer meaningful   adjustment is delayed, the greater the disruption will be.    To develop the essential climate risk management skills and techniques, the Bank of England has just set   out its supervisory expectations for the governance, management and disclosure of these risks by the banks   and insurers in the world�s leading international financial centre.5    And the Bank will be the first regulator to stress test its financial system against different climate pathways,   including the catastrophic business as usual scenario and the ideal�but still challenging�transition to net   zero by 2050 consistent with the UK�s legislated objective.6    This test will mainstream cutting-edge risk management techniques, and it will make the heart of the global   financial system more responsive to changes to both the climate and to government climate policies.    As with climate disclosure, this new risk management needs to go global. That is one reason why the Bank is   developing its stress testing approach in consultation with industry, the credit rating agencies and the   Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) � a group of 29 central banks and supervisors   representing half of global emissions.    Finally, returns. Financial markets increasingly recognise that sustainable investment is the new horizon that   can bring enormous opportunities ranging from transforming energy to reinventing protein.    For sustainable investment to go truly mainstream, it needs to do more than exclude incorrigibly brown   industries and finance new, deep green technologies. Sustainable investing must catalyse and support all   companies that are working to transition from brown to green.       5     Available at: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/prudential-   regulation/supervisorystatement/2019/ss319.pdf?la=en&hash=7BA9824BAC5FB313F42C00889D4E3A6104881C44.   6     The Bank of England set out in its July 2019 FSR its intention to test the UK financial system�s resilience to the physical and transition risks of   climate change. It will gather views on the design of the exercise and, as a first step, will publish a discussion paper in autumn 2019.

At present, one of the biggest hurdles to doing so is the inconsistent measurement of ESG.    We need a common taxonomy to help financial markets rigorously identify environmental outperformance   and to direct investment accordingly.    The EU�s Green Taxonomy and the Green Bond Standard are good starts, but they are binary (dark green or   brown). Mainstreaming sustainable investing will require a richer taxonomy � 50 shades of green.    One promising option, highlighted in this week�s initiative of UN�s Climate Financial Leaders, is the   development of transition indices composed of corporations in high-carbon sectors that have adopted low-   carbon strategies.8    Such approaches are essential for our citizens to make sure their money is invested in line with their values.    To conclude, a financial market in the transition to a 1.5 degree world is being built, but we need to move   much faster. Now it�s time for a step change to bring the reporting, risk management and return optimisation   of sustainable finance into everyday mainstream, financial decision making.    Ultimately, the speed with which the new sustainable financial system develops will be decided by the   ambitions of your climate policies.    If more countries, like the UK, turn their Paris commitments into legislated objectives and concrete actions,   the financial system will amplify the impact of their efforts by pulling forward sustainable investments and   shutting down unsustainable activities.9    It is within our grasp to create a virtuous cycle of innovation and investment for the net zero world that our   citizens are demanding and that future generations deserve.

The COP 21 Agreement is catalysing national policies to limit the global rise in   temperatures to two degrees. 20 countries, which account for 17% of global GDP, have already committed to or legislated for a net-zero emissions   goal, with the UK becoming the first in the G7 to do so.                                                                                                                                                      4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                                4   Insurance, Risk Financing and Development event, 22 September 2019    I would like to speak briefly about the role of insurance in smoothing the transition to a 1.5 degree world. This   sector brings three things: expertise, money and perspective and those are all crucial in helping society   adjust to the reality of that transition.    My message is, whether it�s reducing the protection gap, financing resilient infrastructure or improving   reporting, risk management and return optimisation across the financial sector, your contributions could be   decisive. The insurance industry has a unique contribution of large capital (over $30 trillion), deep risk   management expertise and long-term perspective.    Insurers are well aware that the physical risks of climate change are being felt across the globe with a plague   of extreme weather events.    The human costs are immeasurable.    The financial losses however can be measured and they are significant. Insured losses in 2018 were $80   billion, double the inflation-adjusted average for the past 30 years.10    But protection gaps in low and middle income countries mean that even greater costs are being borne by the   uninsured. In 2017, the record $140 billion of insured losses were eclipsed by an additional $200 billion of   uninsured ones.11 In some of the countries most exposed to climate change - Bangladesh, India, Vietnam,   Philippines, Indonesia, Egypt and Nigeria - insurance penetration is under 1%.12    The potential economic benefits of closing the insurance gap are striking. Lloyd�s of London estimates that a   1% rise in insurance penetration can translate to a 13% reduction in uninsured losses and over 20%   reduction in disaster recover burden on taxpayers. Substantial macroeconomic benefits include increased   investment, higher output (potentially up to 2% of GDP) and greater climate resilience.13    Despite this prize, progress is proving stubbornly slow � over the past 30 years the gap has narrowed by   only from 78% to 70% globally, underscoring the importance of the IDF�s work.14    The role of insurance for adaptation and resilience    So what should be done?     10      Munich Re (2019), The natural disasters of 2018 in figures, See: https://www.munichre.com/topics-online/en/climate-change-and-natural-   disasters/natural-disasters/the-natural-disasters-of-2018-in-figures.html.   11      Swiss Re institute (2018).

On the liability side, the focus must be reducing the protection gap and supporting the resilience of   households and companies to growing climate risks.    Better understanding of past losses can obviously help. Projects like the open-source Oasis Loss Modelling   Framework of the IDF are leveraging the expertise of the private sector, the public sector and academia to   improve the data available for risk analysis in low and middle income countries.15    New products, such as insurance-linked securities based on parametric triggers, are vital to help reduce   macro protection gaps and increase resilience. These are generally cheaper to structure and administer and   more efficient to blend with commercial finance if required.    Of course, increasingly climate-related tail risks could prove uneconomic for private sector insurers to cover.   That is where development agencies and Multilateral Development Banks can step in. Disaster reinsurance   could be one of the most effective uses of development financing.    On the asset side, infrastructure investments will be essential. To transition to net zero, all countries need to   step up their investments in sustainable energy. The reality of climate change also means that all countries,   but particularly developing and emerging economies, will need to invest in new climate-resilient infrastructure   in order to adapt to the new realities of a hotter and more volatile climate.    There are various estimates � they are all enormous - ranging between US$70-90 trillion over the next   decade, three quarters of which are in emerging and developing economies.16    It�s imperative to act now to create practical tools and frameworks to support climate-resilient infrastructure   investments � ranging from broader use of catastrophe bonds to greater risk pooling for the most vulnerable   countries.    Climate-resilient infrastructure assets are well suited to life insurers that need reliable returns over long-term   investment horizons. This is even more compelling in a low-for-long interest rate world. However, as the IDF   has flagged at present only 2.5% of insurance assets managed are allocated to infrastructure17.    So the world needs much more investment in infrastructure, and greater risk sharing of climate risks.   Insurers have a unique ability to meet both needs.       15      See https://oasislmf.org/.   16      Global Commission on the Economy and Climate (2016), The Sustainable Infrastructure Imperative.

As World Bank studies have shown, there is evidence that infrastructure debt can be lower risk as it has   more predictable and stable long-term cash flows and has low correlation to other assets. The historical   default experience of infrastructure debt suggests a �hump-shaped� credit risk profile, which converges to   investment grade quality within a few years after financing has closed.    However, such robustness is not reflected in the standardised approaches for credit risk in most regulatory   frameworks. The World Bank study suggests that capital charges could decline significantly for a   differentiated regulatory treatment of infrastructure debt as a separate asset class. Now, the International   Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) is reviewing the data sources and gaps and considering the risk   case for a differentiated capital treatment for infrastructure under the global Insurance Capital Standard �   ICS 2.0.    We also need to develop the conditions to make infrastructure assets more readily investable and more   easily tradable. Under the Argentine G20 presidency last year, with support from the World Bank and   OECD, the G20 designed a roadmap to make infrastructure a more coherent asset class. The foundation is   greater standardisation through greater commonality in terms, conditions and financial frameworks. This   allows the assets to become easier to invest in, easier to insure, and project risks to be better managed.    Data on the input and impact of infrastructure projects can also be improved. For instance, data on project   phases would allow comparisons across construction phases of infrastructure versus non-infrastructure   assets. Information on the types of concessions and licenses offered in different regions are important as   they determine the kinds of revenue arrangements for infrastructure projects, which ultimately influence cash   flow stability � critical information for investors. The IAIS is developing a workplan to examine these data   gaps in the coming year.    Reporting, risk management and return    Turning to mainstream investing.    Changes in climate policies, technologies and physical risks in the transition to a net zero world will prompt   reassessments of the value of virtually every asset. The financial system will reward companies that adjust   and punish those who don�t.    Insurers can be highly influential in bringing the realities of climate change into mainstream financial   decision-making.    To do so, we need a step change in three areas: reporting, risk management and return.                                                                                                                     7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                           7   Reporting    Better corporate disclosure of climate-related financial risks is essential and the next few years will be   decisive.    On the demand side, current supporters of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)   are responsible for assets totalling $120 trillion and include the world�s globally systemic banks, top 10 global   asset managers, leading pension funds and insurers.    Not surprisingly, supply is responding. Users of capital are providing increasingly sophisticated decision-   useful information. Four-fifths of the top 1,100 G20 companies surveyed in a recent TCFD report are now   disclosing climate-related financial risks in line with the recommendations.    Now is the time to get involved. The IAIS and UN Sustainable Insurance Forum are monitoring developments   in disclosures closely: with a systematic survey of TCFD adoption by insurance firms and they will be   publishing a paper on this early next year, including recommendations for any changes. The Climate Change   Research Initiative (CCRI) will do the same.    The next step is to make these disclosures mandatory. The UK and EU have already signalled their intents.    But it�s time for every country to get involved because the world won�t get to net zero if the financial sector   doesn�t know how our companies are responding. To watch we must be able to see.    Over the next two years, the current process of disclosure by the users of capital, reaction by the suppliers of   capital, and adjustment of these standards will be critical to ensure that the TCFD standards are as   comparable, efficient and as decision-useful as possible.    Risk management    With better information, the frontier will be to upgrade risk management and optimise returns.    As the supervisor of the world�s fourth largest insurance industry, the Bank of England knows that general   insurers and reinsurers are on the front line of managing the physical risks from climate change. Insurers   have responded by developing their modelling and forecasting capabilities, improving exposure   management, and adapting coverage and pricing. In the process, insurers have learned that yesterday�s tail   risk is closer to today�s central scenario.    And leading insurers also understand that the breadth, magnitude, and foreseeable nature of climate risks�   mean the biggest challenge will be to assess the resilience of firms� strategies to transition risks.    That�s why, the Bank of England just set out our supervisory expectations for banks and insurers regarding   their governance, risk management, strategic resilience and disclosure of climate-related financial risks.                                                                                                                      8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                              8   And in June the Bank announced that we will be the first supervisor to stress test our financial system for   resilience against different climate transition pathways: ranging from early and orderly to late and disruptive.    The test will motivate banks, insurers and asset managers to address data gaps and to develop cutting-edge   risk management approaches consistent with a range of possible climate pathways.    The Bank will develop the approach in consultation with industry, including best practice insurers, and other   informed stakeholders including experts from the Network for Greening the Financial System and the PRA�s   Climate Financial Risk Forum.    Return    There is increasing evidence that sustainable investment can generate excess returns, particularly for   investors, like insurers, with longer term horizons.    One of the biggest hurdles to channelling mainstream finance to sustainable investment is the inconsistent   definition and measurement of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria.    An agreed taxonomy would allow markets to understand better where there is real outperformance and direct   investments accordingly.    The EU�s Green Taxonomy and the Green Bond Standard are good starts but they are binary (dark green or   brown) and don�t account for progress from brown to green � progress that could make a significant   contribution to our climate goals.    One possible solution, as recommended by the UN�s Climate Financial Leaders Initiative, could be the   development of transition indices which track companies in high-carbon sectors that adopt low-carbon   strategies.    Such approaches are essential for our citizens to make sure their money is being invested in line with their   values.    Conclusion    Ultimately, the speed with which the new sustainable finance develops will be decided by the coherence and   credibility of countries� climate policies. Finance will complement - and potentially amplify these initiatives�   but it will never substitute for climate policy action.    The policy frameworks with the greatest impact will be: time consistent; transparent; target-based; and   committed, through treaties, nationally determined contributions (NDCs), domestic legislation and   consensus. The 20 countries � including the UK � that have plans to legislate for net zero show what can be   done.                                                                                                                       9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                               9   If countries build their track records, their credibility will grow, and the market will allocate capital to deliver   the necessary innovation and growth and pull forward the adjustment to a low carbon future.    The more prolific the reporting, the more robust the risk management and the more widespread the return   optimisation, the more rapidly the insurance sector can build resilience while promoting the transition that our   citizens demand.                                                                                                                              10     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                    10"

There could be no better host than Japan.     Prime Minister Abe made climate change an important theme of the Japanese G20 presidency, calling on   nations to put �promises into practice�.     And Environment Minister Koizumi recently said Japan is �committed to realising a decarbonised society.�    Japanese companies are heeding these calls. In the past year, almost 200 Japanese firms have joined the   TCFD, bringing Japan to the top of the TCFD league table.1    This welcome progress, and that of the TCFD more generally, must be set against growing challenges. Over   the past five years, global carbon emissions have risen by 20% and sea levels by over 3.3mm per year.2   Global temperatures are on course to increase by 3.4�C by 2100.3    Chart 1: Global warming projections to 2100 under different policy pathways       The physical impact of these changes will not be evenly distributed. With ferocious typhoons, record-   breaking heatwaves and major landslides, Japan is already at the sharp end of a new pattern of devastating   extreme weather events.      1     Full list of current TCFD supporters available at: https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/tcfd-supporters/.   2     Climate.nasa.gov.

Changes in climate   policies, new technologies and growing physical risks will prompt reassessments of the values of virtually   every financial asset. Firms that align their business models to the transition to a net zero world will be   rewarded handsomely. Those that fail to adapt will cease to exist. The longer that meaningful adjustment is   delayed, the greater the disruption will be.    Like virtually everything else in the response to climate change, the development of a more sustainable   financial system is not moving fast enough for the world to reach net zero.    To bring climate risks and resilience into the heart of financial decision making, climate disclosure must   become comprehensive climate risk management must be transformed, and investing for a two degree world   must go mainstream. Today, I want to focus on how the TCFD can help achieve these goals.    TCFD: progress to date    Only two years after the final TCFD recommendations were published, support has sky-rocketed and   conversations about climate-related financial risks have moved from the fringes to the forefront.    The demand for TCFD disclosure is now enormous. Current supporters control balance sheets totalling   $120 trillion and include the world�s top banks, asset managers, pension funds, insurers, credit rating   agencies, accounting firms and shareholder advisory services.4    The supply of disclosure is responding, with four fifths of the top 1100 G20 companies now disclosing   climate-related financial risks in line with some of the TCFD recommendations.5 On every recommended   metric in TCFD, disclosures have been steadily increasing, rising from an average of 2.8 to 3.6 over the past   three years. Three quarters of investors are now using TCFD disclosures when investing and the same   percentage report a marked improvement in the quality of climate disclosures.6    Japanese TCFD supporters increased from 9 to 199 in just over a year and now have a market cap of almost   $2 trillion. Japanese government support through the Implementation Study Group and the TCFD   Consortium has catalysed action and created a blueprint for other countries in �how-to-TCFD�.       4     Full list of current TCFD supporters available at: https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/tcfd-supporters/.   5     The TCFD�s June 2019 Status Report assessed, using artificial intelligence, 1100 companies reports over three years from 2016 to   2018 inclusive.

Companies, financial firms and   policymakers increasingly recognise that disclosures must go beyond the static to the strategic. Climate   risks have a number of distinctive elements, which, in combination, require a strategic approach. These   include their:        ?    Breadth, as climate risks affect multiple lines of business, sectors and geographies;        ?    Magnitude, as the full impacts of climate risks are large, potentially non-linear and irreversible;        ?    Foreseeable nature;        ?    Dependency on short-term actions given that the size of future impacts will, at least in part, be            determined by the actions taken today; and        ?    Uncertain time horizon which may stretch beyond traditional business planning cycles.    The nature of these risks means that the biggest challenge in climate risk management is in assessing the   resilience of firms� strategies to transition risks.    Markets need information to assess which companies can seize the opportunities in a low carbon economy   and which are strategically resilient to the physical and transition risks associated with climate change.                                                                                                                     4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                           4   The good news is that half of the companies surveyed by the TCFD are using scenario analysis to assess   the resilience of their strategies. Financial firms are at the forefront of these assessments.    The Bank�s supervisory body - the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)� surveyed banks in the UK last   year and found that almost three quarters are starting to treat the risks from climate change like other   financial risks � rather than viewing them simply as a corporate social responsibility issue.7    Banks have begun considering the most immediate physical risks to their business models � from the   exposure of mortgage books to flood risk and the impact of extreme weather events on sovereign risk. And   banks have started to assess exposures to transition risks in anticipation of climate action. This includes   exposures to carbon-intensive sectors, consumer loans secured on diesel vehicles, and buy-to-let lending   given new energy efficiency requirements.    To embed essential climate risk management skills recommended by the TCFD in financial decision making,   the Bank of England has set out its supervisory expectations for institutions in the world�s leading   international financial centre with respect to:8         ?    Governance, where firms will be expected to embed fully the consideration of climate risks into             governance frameworks, including at board level, and assign responsibility for oversight of these             risks to specific senior role holders;        ?    Risk management, where firms will need to consider climate change in line with their board-             approved risk appetite;        ?    The regular use of scenario analysis to test strategic resilience; and        ?    Developing and maintain an appropriate disclosure of climate risks.    Recognising the need for industry to build capacity and develop best practices, the PRA has also established   a Climate Financial Risk Forum, jointly with the FCA, to work with firms from across the financial system.    TCFD: The path ahead    Although the private sector has made rapid progress on reporting and risk management, more is required.   Over the next few years, companies, their banks, insurers and investors must:         1. Increase the quantity and quality of disclosures;         2. Refine disclosure metrics to determine which ones are most decision-useful;         3. Spread knowledge on how to assess strategic resilience; and      7     Prudential Regulation Authority report on the impact of climate change on the UK banking sector: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-   /media/boe/files/prudential-regulation/report/transition-in-thinking-the-impact-of-climate-change-on-the-uk-banking-sector.pdf   8     Available at: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/prudential-   regulation/supervisorystatement/2019/ss319.pdf?la=en&hash=7BA9824BAC5FB313F42C00889D4E3A6104881C44.                                                                                                                                      5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                               5        4. Consider how to disclose the extent to which portfolios are ready for the transition to net zero.    Let me explain briefly what this means for the TCFD.    First, we must work to increase the quantity and quality of disclosures by sharing best practice.    Despite the increasing number of TCFD supporters, only a quarter of the companies surveyed disclosed   information aligned with a fuller set � that is six or more � of the TCFD�s recommended disclosures.9    Three quarters of users of climate disclosures said that more information is needed on the financial impact of   climate risks and the strategic resilience of firms.    Progress in both quantity and quality is uneven across sectors. While in 2017 the non-financial sectors   (energy, transport, building and agriculture) led the way, banking is now the most advanced sector in   disclosing information.

Better TCFD disclosure is an opportunity. Research by the Bank of England and PwC finds a positive   correlation between companies� stock price and the number of TCFD disclosures that firms make.10 This   could be because investors reward companies that are leaders in managing climate-related risks or simply       9     TCFD Status Report (2019)   10     On average each additional TCFD disclosure correlates with a 0.18% increase in stock price. While a positive correlation between   financial metric and TCFD disclosure does not indicate that TCFD disclosure caused an increase in stock price, it raises questions for   further analysis about the effect of climate-related disclosures.                                                                                                                                                         6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                                  6   because TCFD adoption identifies companies that are more naturally disposed to longer-term strategic   thinking and planning.    Chart 4: Relationship between stock price and number of TCFD disclosures made       And TCFD disclosure is increasingly a responsibility, as suggested by research from the Commonwealth   Climate and Law Initiative that concludes that non-disclosure is a bigger liability risk than disclosure.11    That is just one reason why jurisdictions like the UK and EU have signalled their intentions to make TCFD   disclosure mandatory.    Second, the TCFD disclosure recommendations should be refined to those that investors consider   most decision-useful.    The TCFD needs to reach a definitive view of what counts as a high quality disclosure before they become   mandatory. In my view the next two reporting periods should balance the urgency of the task and the   imperative of getting it right.    This is best delivered by the current process of disclosure by the users of capital, reaction by the suppliers of   capital, and adjustment of these standards to ensure that the TCFD metrics are as comparable, efficient and   as decision-useful as possible.       11      �Laggard companies that fail to disclose climate risk in line with the TCFD recommendations may be less attractive to investors and   struggle to secure loans or insurance. [F]ailure to disclose may suggest that a company has not considered climate risk, or that it has   something to hide in relation to its exposure � either way, silence can send a warning signal to the market. Conversely, companies that   embrace climate risk reporting will appear ahead of the curve and be well positioned to take full advantage of the commercial   opportunities presented by the transition to a low carbon economy.� For full report, see:   https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/research/sustainable-finance/publications/CCLI-TCFD-Concerns-Misplaced-Report-Final-Briefing.pdf                                                                                                                                         7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                  7   Supervisors of financial sector firms will also need to consider which metrics are most useful for different   levels of assessment:        -    Microprudential, to assess how individual firms are managing climate-related risks � for example the            impact of a physical or transition risk on a loan book.        -    Macroprudential, to consider how and whether individual exposures could scale up to systemic risk        -    Macroeconomic, to help understand how the financial system and economy interact in different            climate transition scenarios.    Quantitative assessments could help guide these judgements. Research by the Bank and PwC found that   some TCFD disclosures were positively correlated with stock price of firms that have disclosed to date, with   the disclosures about a firm�s targets; scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions; risk management, resilience and impacts   exhibiting the strongest correlations. Note that given the potential selection bias of companies with climate   strategies tend to be early adopters of the TCFD, these correlations were positive.

To this   end, the Bank will continue its research.    Third, we must spread knowledge on how to measure and use information on strategic resilience to   manage risks and realise opportunities.    Consistent with the Paris Accord�s objective to stabilise temperature increases to below two degrees, many   governments are now committing to reaching net zero carbon by 2050.    In convening this Summit, Prime Minister Abe has rightly highlighted the enormous investments that will be   necessary to deliver these objectives.                                                                                                                         8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                8   With an estimated US $90 trillion of infrastructure spending expected between 2015 and 2030, the right   decisions now can make sure those investments are both financially rewarding and environmentally   sustainable.    There has been a recent surge of environmentally focused investment funds. In Japan alone, ESG assets   quadrupled from 2016 to 2018 to reach $2 trillion.    As the transition gains traction, it is likely that both ESG and mainstream investors will increasingly focus on   companies� strategic resilience to climate change.12    95% of users found TCFD information on strategic resilience useful, but three quarters want more   information on the financial impacts.13 This year�s report to the Osaka G20 Summit found that, while firms   were starting to consider strategic resilience, only about 50% systematically conducted scenario analysis and   of those that did, two fifths did not disclose the information.14 Almost 80% considered the assessment of   strategic resilience somewhat or very difficult, identifying a lack of relevant and granular data, the difficulty in   determining scenarios to use, and the quantification of climate risks and opportunities as the biggest   hurdles.15    This is not surprising � scenario analysis is a new and complex practice. And most of the off-the-shelf   climate scenarios (such as the IEA and IPCC publications) are intended for policy or research, not business   analysis. Improvements will be best achieved with collective force.    For some companies, scenario analysis is already part of their business planning and risk management. The   TCFD report provides case studies � from Rio Tinto to Unilever to Citi � and finds common characteristics of   good scenario analysis:         ?    Using multiple climate-related scenarios to assess strategic resilience        ?    Describing assumptions and parameters specific to the company        ?    Identifying potential impacts of climate-related risks or opportunities        ?    Disclosing potential strategic resilience under different climate-related scenarios    To develop leading practices, the TCFD has created a Knowledge Hub which provides guidance, research,   tools, standards, frameworks and webinars.16      12      The Task Force encourages companies to describe the characteristics of their strategies that allow them to adapt to climate-related   changes materially affecting their business while maintaining operations and profitability and safeguarding people, assets, and overall   reputation. The TCFD report identifies that Investors are likely to need information on the range of scenarios considered by a company;   implications of each scenario for the business; strategic options considered; and the reasoning around the strategy adopted. Another   factor that may warrant disclosure is the company�s ability�and flexibility�to adjust its strategy in response to emerging climate   conditions, including alternative ways to use resources and the robustness and redundancy of business processes.   13      TCFD Status Report (2019) pg. 64   14      TCFD Status Report (2019) pg. 63   15      TCFD Status Report (2019) pg. 62   16      This includes several industry associations and non-governmental organizations that have brought companies together to work   through sector-specific approaches to climate change issues. For example, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development   (WBCSD) has convened or announced �preparer forums� for various sectors and industries: oil and gas; electric utilities; chemicals;                                                                                                                                       9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                  9   Looking ahead, the TCFD is currently considering how to:         ?    Provide additional guidance on how to conduct scenario analysis;        ?    Publish business-relevant scenario templates to lower implementation costs; improve understanding             and improve comparability; and        ?    Start a work stream on how to roll out these approaches to portfolio measurement to more asset             owners.    The Bank of England is doing our part by assessing the strategic resilience of the world�s leading financial   centre. The Bank will be the first regulator to stress test its financial system against different climate   pathways, including the catastrophic business as usual scenario and the ideal�but still challenging�   transition to net zero by 2050 consistent with the UK�s legislated objective.17    In response, banks will need to establish how their borrowers are managing current and future climate-   related risks and opportunities. Those assessments will reveal:         ?    Which firms have strategies for the transition to a net zero economy;         ?    Which are gambling on new technologies or government inaction; and         ?    Which haven�t yet thought through the risks and opportunities.    The test will help develop and mainstream cutting-edge risk management techniques, and it will make the   heart of the global financial system more responsive to changes in the climate and to government climate   policies.    As with climate disclosure, such strategic assessments will need to go global if the world is going to stabilise   temperatures below two degrees. That is one reason why the Bank is developing its stress testing approach   in consultation with industry, the Credit Rating Agencies and the Network for Greening the Financial System   (NGFS) � a group of 42 central banks and supervisors (including the JFSA) that represent half of global   emissions.    Fourth and finally, the TCFD should consider how asset owners could best disclose how well their   portfolios are positioned for the transition to net zero.       construction; automobiles; and food, agriculture, and forest products. The United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative   worked with 16 large global banks to pilot the TCFD recommendations and develop a scenario-based approach for assessing the   potential impact of climate change on the banks� lending portfolios.   17      The Bank of England set out in its July 2019 FSR its intention to test the UK financial system�s resilience to the physical and transition   risks of climate change. It will gather views on the design of the exercise and, as a first step, will publish a discussion paper in autumn   2019. More information available at: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/financial-stability-report/2019/july-2019.pdf.                                                                                                                                             10     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                        10   For sustainable investment to go truly mainstream, it needs to do more than exclude incorrigibly brown   industries and finance new, deep green technologies. Sustainable investing must catalyse and support all   companies that are working to transition from brown to green.    Such �tilt� investment strategies, which overweight high ESG stocks, and �momentum� investment strategies,   which focus on companies that have improved their ESG ratings, have outperformed global benchmarks for   close to a decade.    More widespread adoption of such strategies is essential. At present, one of the biggest hurdles to doing so   is the huge variation in the measurement of ESG.18    Common taxonomies to identify environmental outperformance, such as the EU�s Green Taxonomy and the   Green Bond Standard can help but they tend to be binary (either dark green or all brown).    Mainstreaming sustainable investing will require a richer taxonomy � 50 shades of green.    One promising option highlighted by the UN�s Climate Financial Leaders is the development of transition   indices composed of corporations in high-carbon sectors that have adopted low carbon strategies.    Consideration should also be given to the new assessments by leading asset owners of how well their   portfolios are positioned for a two degree target.    Once again, Japan is leading the way. GPIF, the world�s largest pension fund, calculates that its portfolio is   aligned to a 3.5 degree world. Allianz assesses that it is on 3.7 degree path and has committed to get to 1.5   degrees by 2050. AXA estimates that its assets are currently consistent with a 3.7 degree path, and it has   developed an innovative climate VaR model to measure the opportunities as well as risks from the climate-   related exposures of its investments.19    With our citizens�led by the young�demanding climate action, it is becoming essential for asset owners to   disclose the extent to which their clients� money is being invested in line with their values.    Conclusion    The TCFD provides the necessary foundation for the financial sector�s role in the transition to net zero that   our planet needs and our citizens demand.       18      With the growth of different ESG measurement approaches, scores have been shown to vary greatly between providers. Barclays   found positive but low correlations across all three ESG dimensions (14% for governance and 13% for environment) when comparing   MSCI and Sustainalytics. Similarly, State Street Global Advisors found a correlation of 0.53 for constituents of the MSCI World Index.   19      See Axa 2019 Climate Report, available on: https://www-axa-com.cdn.axa-contento-118412.eu/www-axa-com%2F308285a0-f209-   4b04-9a3e-41d8df848445_axa2019_ra_en_climate_report_19_07_2019_pdf_mel.pdf.                                                                                                                                        11     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                  11   So whether the TCFD is used to manage the growing physical and transition risks from climate change or to   finance the enormous opportunities to develop more resilient and sustainable economies, your work to   develop the TCFD and spread its adoption is literally vital.                                                                                                              12     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                    12"
2019-10-14	"Light is therefore Colour: Remarks at the launch of the new �20   banknote   Speech given by   Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England     Turner Contemporary Gallery, Margate   10 October 2019       I would like to thank Clare Macallan for her assistance in preparing these remarks and Lizzie Levett   and Lisa Young for providing background information.                                                                                                           1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches   It is a pleasure to be back at Turner Contemporary in Margate to unveil the new �20 banknote featuring JMW   Turner.    Banknote character    Turner was a frequent visitor to Margate, drawn by �the skies over Thanet�, which he held to be �the loveliest   in all Europe�. The East Kent coast inspired more than 100 of his works and this gallery stands on the site of   Mrs Booth�s seafront guesthouse, where Turner stayed whenever he visited.    Turner�s contribution to art extends well beyond this stretch of shoreline. He was precocious � exhibiting at   the Royal Academy at 15, and becoming an Academician at 24 � as well as prolific, producing more than   550 oil paintings, 2,000 watercolours, and 30,000 sketches and drawings.    Turner is rightly celebrated for his unique ability to capture light and highly varied atmospheric effects   through use of vibrant colour and flowing brushwork; he often went to extremes in pursuit of the visceral   artistic experience. His paintings blaze with the heat of the sun, shimmer in moonshine, and rumble under   the weight of gathering storm clouds.    These works transformed the field of landscape art. Before Turner, landscapes were generally viewed as   subjects unworthy in their own right; their role was merely to provide backdrop to the real action. Turner   elevated the genre by showing how paint could not only convey the appearance of a place but also capture   something of its spirit.    Turner also used art to hold a mirror to the technological and social transformations happening around him.   Masterpieces such as Rain, Steam and Speed � The Great Western Railway captured the advent of the   steam age. The Slave Ship reflected on the moral preoccupations of his times.    The artistic developments that Turner pioneered resonated well beyond his lifetime, providing inspiration to   the Impressionists and leading Mark Rothko to joke �This man Turner, he learnt a lot from me�.                 A   contemporary reviewer may have put it best when he placed Turner among �the masters whose day is not so   much of to-day, as of �all times��.1    Indeed, Turner�s legacy endures today through his influence on art for over two centuries, to the prize that   bears his name to celebrate British contemporary art, to this magnificent gallery, the Turner Contemporary.    Soon Turner�s work will feature on another 2 billion works of art � the new �20 notes from the Bank of   England.       1       The Champion, Newspaper Article, published 7 May 1815.                                                                                                              2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                           2   Banknote design    The new �20 note celebrates Turner, his art and his legacy in all their radiant, colourful glory.    The design features Turner�s self-portrait, from 1799, alongside one of his most eminent paintings, The   Fighting Temeraire.2 This painting is a tribute to the HMS Temeraire � which battled with distinction during   Nelson�s victory at Trafalgar in 1805 � and an elegy to the decline of sail, showing the great warship being   pulled by a steam tug to her last berth to be broken up for scrap.                             The novelist William Makepeace   Thackeray called it �as grand a painting as ever figured on the walls of any academy, or came from the easel   of any painter�.3 The public clearly agrees, voting it Britain�s greatest painting in a BBC poll in 2005. 4    The Fighting Temeraire exemplifies Turner�s innovative use of light, shade, colour and tone.                                     These   contributions to the visual arts are captured in the quote � �Light is therefore colour� � which is from an 1818   lecture by Turner.    Turner rarely signed his paintings, so the signature on the banknote was taken from his will. That is fitting   because, in a codicil to that testament, he bequeathed his paintings to the nation, and in doing so made a   significant contribution to British society. Few Turners are locked away in private collections or spread to the   four winds. The vast majority are free for the British public to see across some of our greatest galleries.    The note references several of these galleries. A small purple foil on the reverse side of the note echoes the   spiral staircase at Tate Britain, which holds most of the Turner Bequest in the Clore Gallery. The main foil of   the note contains an image of Turner Contemporary in blue. And the shape of the window around the foil is   based on the Trafalgar Fountains, which are an iconic feature in the square outside The National Gallery   where The Fighting Temeraire hangs.    The purpose of design features like these is not simply to make the banknotes beautiful but also to   strengthen their security.    The new �20 will be our most secure note yet, featuring several innovative elements. For example, rather   than having a single foil element � the Turner Contemporary in blue � there is an additional foil in a second   colour: the Margate Lighthouse in gold. And there is a second transparent element in the bottom corner of   the note, inspired by the windows of Tintern Abbey, which was a popular tourist spot in Turner�s times and   which he memorialised in another of his great watercolours in 1794.    These security features are made possible by printing the new �20 on polymer, rather than paper. Polymer   banknotes also remain in good condition for longer, meaning the new �20 will be safer, cleaner and stronger.       2     The self-portrait is currently on display in Tate Britain, and The Fighting Temeraire can been seen in The National Gallery.   3     P.

Features like the differing colour palettes, differing sizes and raised print enable those who are   visually impaired to recognise different notes. As with the new polymer �10, the new �20 will also include a   tactile feature � a series of raised dots in the upper left-hand corner � to improve accessibility further.    Conclusion    Banknotes are meagre pieces of paper � or more accurately polymer � of no intrinsic value that serve vital   economic functions. They facilitate trade. They store value. They act as a unit of account. As the man   whom Turner will replace on the �20 Adam Smith observed, banknotes may be mere barren tokens but they   are the �universal instrument of commerce�.5    And money serves as a collective memory for a country and its people; it has cultural value as well as   economic.    As the new Turner �20 testifies, money can be a work of art in everyone�s pocket. Far from being �barren�, 6   our banknotes celebrate UK�s heritage, salute its culture and testify to the great achievements of its most   notable citizens.    That tradition continues with the new �20. JMW Turner will circulate alongside Winston Churchill on the �5,   and Jane Austen on the �10. In 2021, Alan Turing will soon replace Boulton and Watt on the �50. These   individuals have advanced British thought, demonstrated exceptional leadership, and more generally helped   to shape this diverse society and forge our common values.    I�m delighted to be joined today to celebrate Turner�s continuing influence by one of our most eminent artists,   someone whom Turner has influenced and one of Margate�s own.

2019-12-11	Remarks given at a panel to launch the third annual America�s   Pledge report, at the 25th Annual Conference of the Parties   Mark Carney   Governor of the Bank of England       US Climate Action Centre, Madrid   10 December 2019       I am grateful to Jennifer Nemeth for her assistance in preparing these remarks.                                                                                      1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches   Introduction    The Accelerating America�s Pledge report comprehensively documents the scale of change that is needed   across our economies to put emissions on a trajectory consistent with building a net zero economy.    That will require a more sustainable financial system.    Changes in climate policies, new technologies and growing physical risks will prompt reassessments of the   values of virtually every financial asset.    Firms that align their business models with the transition to net zero will be rewarded handsomely. Those   that fail to adapt will cease to exist.    Now is the time to ensure that every financial decision takes climate change into account.    For that change to happen, we need to focus on the three Rs � reporting, risk management and return.    First, reporting    In 2015, G20 leaders tasked representatives from the public and private sectors to review how the financial   system takes into account climate risks. We established a Task Force on Climate-related Financial   Disclosures (TCFD), chaired by Mike Bloomberg.    Four years on, the TCFD has generated a step change in both the demand for and supply of climate   reporting.    The demand for TCFD disclosure is now enormous. Current supporters control balance sheets totalling   $120 trillion and include the world�s top banks, asset managers, pension funds and insurers.    The supply of disclosure is responding, with four fifths of the top 1100 global companies now disclosing   climate-related financial risks in line with some of the TCFD recommendations. On every recommended   metric in TCFD, disclosures have been steadily increasing. Three quarters of major investors surveyed are   now using available TCFD disclosures when investing.    Mike Bloomberg�s path-breaking initiative on climate disclosure is creating the platform to bring sustainable   to the finance mainstream.    Now we must build on this foundation by:    First, over the next year, enhancing both the quality and quality of disclosures to make TCFD standards as   comparable, efficient and as decision-useful as possible.    And, by COP26, exploring pathways to make TCFD disclosure mandatory.                                                                                                                2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                        2   Second, risk management    For the market to understand where climate risks and opportunities lie, disclosures need to go beyond the   static to the strategic. That means assessing the resilience of firms� strategies to transition risks.    This is hard. Only half of TCFD supporters systematically conduct scenario analysis and, of those that do,   three fifths don�t disclose it.    Fortunately, a number of promising initiatives are currently in train to build best practice.    First, TCFD case studies � from Rio Tinto to Unilever and Citi � detail characteristics of good scenario   analysis.    Second, the TCFD Knowledge Hub provides guidance, research, tools, standards, frameworks and   webinars.    Third, the Bank of England will become the first regulator to stress test its major banks and insurers against   different climate pathways, including the catastrophic business�as-usual scenario, the ideal � but still   challenging �transition to net zero by 2050, and the late policy action � or climate Minsky moment � scenario   that could bring a sudden recognition of the scale of stranded assets.    Our stress test of the world�s leading international financial centre will show how major financial firms expect   to adjust their business models, and what the collective impact of these responses could be on the wider   economy.    It will reveal the banks � and by extension companies � that are preparing for the transition to net zero as   well as those who have not yet developed strategies consistent with America�s Pledge or the UK�s legislated   commitment to net zero.    To take this approach global, we will share it with the 50 other central banks and supervisors in the Network   for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) so that they can stress test their own financial systems, which   cover two thirds of the world�s emissions.    Finally, return.    The Paris Agreement calls on the financial sector to reorient financial flows in line with the two degree target.    Achieving this transition will require sustainable investment to go mainstream.    To do so, sustainable investment must do more than exclude incorrigibly brown industries and finance new,   deep green technologies. Sustainable investing must catalyse and support all companies that are working to   transition from brown to green.                                                                                                                    3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                            3   To date, approaches to measuring and managing the financial implications of climate change for investments   have been inadequate. Carbon footprints are not forward-looking, divestments only focus on the most   carbon-intensive sectors, green investments are still small scale, and the impact of shareholder engagement   is hard to measure.    One of the most promising options is to assess the �warming potential� of investment portfolios. For   example, GPIF, the world�s largest pension fund, estimates that its assets are currently consistent with a   3.7 degree path.    Such a forward looking measure can help asset owners and asset managers understand the transition   pathways of their investments and develop strategies to align financial flows with the necessary transition to   net zero.    Degree warming will reveal who is on the right and wrong side of history. It will provide a signal to   governments about where the economy is on the transition path and therefore the effectiveness of their   policies.    It will empower consumers, giving them more choice in how to invest to support the transition.    With our citizens, particularly the young, demanding climate action, it is becoming essential for asset owners   to disclose the extent to which their clients� money is being invested in line with the values of those clients.    To this end, for COP26, the TCFD is establishing a subcommittee to consider how to standardise the   methodology for measuring the warming potential of assets and expanding its use.    Conclusion    A market in the transition to a net zero world is being built. It will reveal how the valuations of companies   could change over time as climate policies adapt and carbon intensity declines.    It will expose the likely future costs of doing business, of paying for emissions, and of tighter regulation.    It will help smooth price adjustments as society�s opinions and government policies change.    As countries build their policy track records and their credibility grows, the financial system will amplify the   impact of those policies and pull forward adjustment to the net zero carbon future,    Consistent with the ambitions of America�s Pledge, the next year will be critical to mainstreaming sustainable   finance.                                                                                                                          4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                               4
2019-12-18	"Remarks at a farewell dinner in honour of Beno�t C�ure,   member of the ECB Executive Board   Speech given by   Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England     European Central Bank, Frankfurt   17 December 2019       I am grateful to Clare Macallan and James Benford for their assistance in preparing these remarks.                                                                                                         1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches   Before I begin, I must emphasise that those who might be searching for cryptic central bank signals about   future policy will be disappointed. I am speaking in the MPC�s quiet period, and my comments have no   bearing whatsoever on the decision the MPC will announce on Thursday.    This wonderful evening celebrates an extraordinary individual. There should be, and will be, great joy and   immense gratitude. But as with all such occasions there is also the melancholic feeling of an end of an era,   the passing of the ancien regime.    Certainly, central banks face many challenges:        ?   Markets prone to severe bouts of illiquidity;        ?   A global economy that risks falling into a low growth, low inflation rut caused by deep structural           forces, limited policy space, and growing concerns over the fracturing of the global trading system;        ?   Innovations in private payments encroaching on central banks� very raison d��tre, the provision of           money; and        ?   A growing climate crisis that will affect every aspect of finance.    So it is tempting to ask: Apr�s Beno�t le d�luge?    Fortunately, the financial guillotine is not preordained, for Beno�t did not spend his days in power as did   Louis XV. Where the king grew idle, Beno�t remained frenetic (189 public speeches during his eight years).   Where the king was conservative, Beno�t was radical. Where the king became nostalgic, Beno�t always   looked forward.    If central banks are to rise to their challenges and serve our citizens, we will need to build on Beno�t�s legacy.    I. Improving market functioning    Let me start with market functioning.    Before the crisis, financial alchemy appeared to have sliced, diced and distributed risk to those who wanted it   most. The revolutions in securitised and derivative finance were cheered on by policymakers who saw more   markets as the solution to any market failures and who believed the lie that markets always clear.    But of course markets always clear only in textbooks. In reality, people are irrational, economies are   imperfect, and nature itself is unknowable. The pre-crisis system had merely spread risk, contingently and   opaquely, in ways that often increased it.                                                                                                                      2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                             2   Once the crisis began, risk quickly concentrated on the balance sheets of intermediaries that were   themselves capital constrained. And with the fates of borrowers and lenders tied together via   hyper-globalised banks and markets, problems at the core spread violently to the periphery.    The post-crisis response included major reforms to simplify markets and make them more robust.    A vital plank was to encourage greater central clearing of OTC trades, which prior to the crisis had been   largely unregulated, unreported and bilaterally settled. When Lehman fell, uncertainty about these   exposures sparked panic.    Routing bilateral trades through central counterparties untangles this tangled web. Globally, the stock of   centrally cleared derivatives has more than doubled since the crisis.1 And around two-thirds of outstanding   interest rate derivatives in the UK and Europe are cleared through CCPs.2    Of course, central clearing means that CCPs are sources of systemic risk, which is why Beno�t led efforts to   build their resilience and improve their resolvability.    As Chair of the Committee on Payments and Markets Infrastructure (CPMI), he oversaw the implementation   of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure � a set of demanding, international standards for   payment, clearing and settlement systems that ensure CCPs are robust to shocks. As a result, an additional   $1 trillion of collateral is now held globally against all derivative trades.    Under Beno�t�s leadership, the CPMI has worked with other authorities to finalise and implement global   standards for resolution. And he has consistently encouraged greater cross-border cooperation, better   information sharing and more coordinated stress testing.    Whilst the infrastructure that underpins our markets is now in much better shape, nascent risks remain that, if   left unchecked, could bring new problems. Consider market liquidity.    During the crisis, liquidity dried up, particularly in the interbank market, as cash-rich banks hoarded excess   funds. In parallel, a �run on repo�, triggered by increased haircuts on collateral to guard against counterparty   risk, pushed the shadow banking sectors in advanced economies to collapse. In the euro area, the   sovereign debt crisis compounded these problems, causing some markets to splinter along national lines.    Global reforms address the fault lines that caused this fiasco. New global standards for liquidity regulation   are now in place including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio. Bank capital   standards now take into account exposures to shadow banks, including step-in risk, and through-the-cycle   margining prevents Minsky cycles in secured lending.       1       See https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/R191118-1-1.pdf.   2       See https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma50_157_2025_asr_derivatives.pdf.                                                                                                                   3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                            3   These reforms are transforming banks� approach to liquidity management and building the resilience of the   system as a whole. For example, liquid assets � relative to liabilities that can readily run � are tenfold higher   than before the crisis.    However, the recent volatility in US dollar repo markets suggest there are still frictions that need to be   addressed. Contrary to expectations, banks did not step into the market to lend cash, viewing the profit   opportunity to be insufficient to offset the impact on perceived regulatory liquidity requirements. The Federal   Reserve�s open market operations have since calmed the market, but term repo rates remain elevated, as   dealers are pricing in a higher likelihood of similar spikes in future.    While it may be tempting to conclude this is an isolated incident, there have been others, including the taper   and bund tantrums. These could signal a broader problem of discontinuous market liquidity in stress.    The solution is not to unwind post-crisis liquidity regulation, a recidivism that would only recreate, with time,   the enormous systemic risks of the past. Moreover, the limited systemic consequences of these events   should be noted. After all, the riskiness of an asset depends on who holds it. A �crisis� in the periphery is a   bad day in the markets; one in the core is an annus horribilis for the real economy.    Nevertheless, market infrastructure must evolve to take account of new dynamics. In one of Beno�t�s (many)   speeches last month, he identified one of the potential problems underlying the repo market stress: that   what may look to be sufficient liquidity in aggregate can prove too little if it is asymmetrically distributed �   either across institutions or national boundaries.    As Beno�t noted, this may require central banks to provide more liquidity in aggregate, including by widening   access to their balance sheets. Prompted by the potential risks that come with Brexit, the Bank of England   has come to a similar conclusion: we are already running weekly auctions in sterling, US dollars and euros   that could be used to absorb pressures as they arise. We also have a contingent term repo facility that we   could activate at a higher frequency if needed; and we � like the ECB � can lend to a very broad range of   counterparties against a wide range of collateral.    Central banks and regulators must also be clear that liquidity facilities and buffers are there to be used. For   example, in October, the Bank clarified our supervisory expectations to re-emphasise our commitment to   providing liquidity in the ordinary course of business. We do not expect firms to justify any usage, nor is   there any presumption they would use their own buffers before our facilities. Next year�s first system-wide   liquidity stress test will be another opportunity to demonstrate that liquidity buffers are fully useable.    Increased central clearing would be a capital-efficient way to further improve repo market liquidity; this would   be most effective if smaller institutions participated directly. And a more holistic approach by firms to internal   capital management would make them more agile, including not applying the leverage ratio at the desk level.                                                                                                                          4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                               4   Liquidity concerns also go to the heart of otherwise immensely positive developments in market-based   finance.    As is the case for banks, the institutions at the heart of market-based finance, particularly open-ended   investment funds, must prudently manage their leverage and liquidity. Mismatches between redemption   terms and the liquidity of some funds� assets means there is an advantage to investors who redeem ahead of   others, particularly in stress. This has the potential to become a systemic risk as first mover advantage could   prompt a de-stabilising rush to the exits.    In response, the Bank of England and the FCA have decided that there should be greater consistency   between the liquidity of a fund�s assets and its redemption terms. Specifically:     ?   The liquidity of funds� assets should be assessed either as the price discount needed for a quick sale of        a vertical slice of those assets or the time period needed for a sale to avoid a material price discount.     ?   Investors who redeem should receive a price for their units that reflects the discount needed to sell the        required proportion of a fund�s assets in the specified redemption notice period; and     ?   Redemption notice periods should reflect the time needed to sell the required proportion of a fund�s        assets without discounts beyond those captured in the price received by redeeming investors.    Our next steps are to consider how these principles could be implemented and, in particular, the stress   against which liquidity measures and redemption terms should be calibrated. We expect to publish the   review�s conclusions in the summer and these will, where appropriate, inform the development of UK   standards for open-ended funds. Our conclusions will also inform our international engagement for example   with the FSB, IOSCO and other competent authorities on the financial stability risks of asset management   activity.    II. Creating monetary policy space    Effective market functioning matters for price stability as well as financial stability.    During the crisis, the impaired banking system and dysfunctional corporate debt markets muted the   transmission of monetary stimulus and led to inefficiencies in risk-sharing and capital allocation. Ultimately,   companies and households bore a heavy cost.    Strains in monetary policy transmission were particularly pronounced in the euro area, where the   fragmentation of markets along national lines meant cuts to the ECB�s policy rates were not passed through   equally in all countries. Households and companies of comparable credit worthiness faced different   borrowing rates depending on their location. These problems worsened over 2012, when markets began to   price in some redenomination risk in a few euro-area countries.    It fell to Beno�t and his fellow members of the ECB�s Governing Council to fix the problem.                                                                                                                      5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                             5   Throughout the crisis, the ECB rightly and swiftly injected huge quantities of additional reserves into the   system, as asset-backed commercial paper and the interbank markets dried up.    In response to the worsening sovereign debt crisis in 2012, the Governing Council created Outright Monetary   Transactions, a programme whose very existence eliminated the unwarranted and self-reinforcing fears of a   euro-area break-up and restored sovereign bond spreads to levels more consistent with credit rather than   currency risk.    During this time, Beno�t added his voice to the calls for a capital markets union, not least because it would   broaden the transmission mechanism and increase the potency of monetary policy.    He also recognised that the ECB�s actions could only tackle the symptoms of financial market fragmentation.   Addressing their root causes required stronger banks, a more resilient financial system, solvent   governments, and the delinking of bank and sovereign credit risk.    On the two of these imperatives, the EU has made welcome progress, with the establishment of the Single   Supervisory Mechanism and the European Systemic Risk Board. These bodies are helping address a   classic collective action problem by overcoming the inevitable temptation of national supervisors to ring-   fence liquidity and capital within national boundaries to the detriment of a single market for capital.    Alongside improving the transmission mechanism, the ECB made important advances in the conduct of   monetary policy. It has reduced the effective lower bound on policy rates and created additional stimulus   through forward guidance, new lending facilities and innovative asset purchase programmes. These actions   have helped shape the expectations of both market participants and the general public.    The challenge now facing the ECB � and monetary policy makers more broadly � is to provide sufficient   stimulus to meet its price stability objective when powerful structural forces are pushing down equilibrium   interest rates.    As I noted at Jackson Hole,3 the risk of a global liquidity trap puts a high premium on getting more than just   monetary policy right. In a global liquidity trap, central banks cannot be the only policy makers who do   �whatever it takes.� There are clear gains from coordination, with other policies � particularly fiscal policy �   having important roles.    The biggest gains would come from lowering trade tensions. This is pushing up hurdle rates on investment,   swamping the impact of lower policy rates. Reducing uncertainty would turn a vicious cycle � in which falling   equilibrium interest rates eat into policy space, exacerbating downside risks and pushing down equilibrium   rates further � into a virtuous one, of rising equilibrium rates, increased policy space, and stronger global   growth.      3     �The Growing Challenges for Monetary Policy in the current International Monetary and Financial System�, speech by Mark Carney at   the Jackson Hole Symposium 2019.                                                                                                                                    6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                              6   III. Transforming payments    During Beno�t�s time at the ECB, the public provision of money has faced challenges from Bitcoin to   stablecoins.    The Bank of England has an open mind but not open door when it comes to such innovations. Unlike social   media, for which standards and regulations are only now being developed after the technologies have been   adopted by billions of users, the terms of engagement for any new systemic private payments system must   be in force well in advance of any launch. And there are a host of issues that still need to be addressed �   from maintaining the highest standards of operational resilience and managing financial risks, to addressing   privacy and anti-money laundering concerns.    Like Benoit, we recognise that these initiatives were not conceived in a vacuum; rather they seek to address   long-standing problems in payments. Despite the ongoing revolution in online commerce, payments are   often more expensive than they need be and still take too long to clear.    UK card payments are convenient and they are now the most popular means of payment, but they can cost   between 0.5% and 2% of the total transaction value, and it can take three days for the merchant to receive   their money.    The scope for improving cross border payments is bigger still. These can cost up to 10 times their domestic   equivalent. Anti-money laundering checks that are rightly required can be cumbersome. Settlement is slow,   with money taking up to a week to reach the recipient.    During his time at the ECB, Beno�t oversaw significant progress in building a pan-European payments   system for the wholesale side.    Nonetheless, developments in retail payments have lagged. Euro-area customers are now starting to turn to   non-European cards when making non-cash payments.    Last month, sensing the opportunity for another speech, Beno�t announced that the ECB�s Governing   Council was relaunching its retail payments strategy. The goal is to create a retail payments system that is   as convenient, cost-effective, safe and secure when operating across borders as across the shop counter;   and one that works as well for merchants outside the EU as it does for those within it.    Delivering a better retail payments experience will require the ECB and the Bank of England to provide the   best-in-class payment infrastructure that can enable private innovators to deliver the payment products and   services our citizens need. We intend to collaborate closely, sharing perspectives on policy issues and   technical designs. And we look forward to leveraging advancements arising from Beno�t�s new role leading   the BIS Innovation Hub.                                                                                                                     7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                          7   Innovation is best achieved by empowering competition. For the Bank, this means levelling the playing field   between old and new by allowing new entrants access to the same resources as incumbents, while holding   similar risks to similar standards. It also means updating our public infrastructure to enable state-of-the-art   private sector solutions to emerge which will lower costs, increase speed and improve customer experience   of domestic and international payments.    Any new payments system must be efficient, resilient and secure. A safe payment system is only useful if   people use it, which means it must deliver fast, user-friendly and inclusive services. This in turn requires that   payment systems are open to innovation and competition, and are built around the comparative advantages   of central banks and the private sector.    Addressing the Climate Crisis    My final challenge facing central banks is the most fundamental. Indeed, it is existential.    Four years since the Paris Agreement, a more sustainable financial system is being built. It�s funding private   sector innovation, it has the potential to amplify the effectiveness of government climate policies, and it could   accelerate the transition to a net zero economy.    But we must go much further if the world is to reach net zero carbon emissions. Disclosure must become   comprehensive. Risk management must be transformed. Sustainable investing must go mainstream.    In short, every financial decision must take climate change into account.    Achieving that requires improvements on three Rs: reporting, risk management and return.        ?   On reporting, TCFD standards must be enhanced to be as comparable, efficient and decision-useful           as possible. And we need to develop pathways to mandatory climate disclosures.        ?   To manage risks, disclosures need to go beyond the static to the strategic. We must assess the           resilience of the core of the financial system to transition risks, including through stress testing. The           Bank will publish a discussion paper on our planned climate stress test tomorrow and we look           forward to taking this forward internationally through the Network for Greening the Financial System           (NGFS).        ?   On returns, asset managers and asset owners will increasingly have to assess the transition paths of           their investments and report their impact to their clients. Our citizens need to be able to see whether           their investments are consistent with the path to net zero.    Central banks cannot stand on the side lines of this revolution. And with Benoit�s research and Christine�s   leadership, I am confident that the ECB will be at the vanguard.

The flood of acclaim you�ve received is rightly bestowed. You have provided exemplary   leadership, driving progress on improving the functioning of payments systems and broader financial market   infrastructure, both within the euro area and internationally.    If anyone has prepared us to withstand the coming deluge, it�s you.

2020-01-20	"A Framework for All Seasons?   Speech given by   Mark Carney   Governor of the Bank of England     Bank of England Research Workshop on The Future of Inflation Targeting   9 January 2020       I am grateful to Clare Macallan for her assistance in drafting these remarks and to Nishat Anjum and   Alexis Tessier for background research and analysis.                                                                                                           1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches   Introduction    Following a chequered history of high and volatile inflation in the post-war era, the UK finally found monetary   success as an early adopter of inflation targeting in 1992. The UK�s current regime, launched in 1997,   delegated operational independence for setting monetary policy to the Bank of England and included many   institutional innovations that have stood the test of time � most notably a Monetary Policy Committee with a   mix of internal and external members; transparent, independent voting; and a clear accountability framework.    Since operational independence for inflation targeting was delegated to the MPC, there have been a raft of   improvements, both large and small. Transparency has steadily increased with initiatives ranging from   publishing detailed assumptions underlying forecasts ex ante to assessing forecast accuracy ex post as well   as the simultaneous release of Monetary Policy Summaries, Minutes, and Inflation Reports. More recently,   the MPC has introduced layered communications, with simpler, more accessible language and graphics to   reach the broadest possible audience, and we have launched the Monetary Policy Report in order to give   greater prominence to the most pressing issues shaping each monetary policy decision.    A major improvement to the inflation targeting framework itself was to confirm explicitly beginning with the   2013 remit that the MPC is required to have regard to trade-offs between keeping inflation at the target and   avoiding undesirably volatility in output. In other words, the MPC can use the full flexibility of inflation   targeting in the face of exceptionally large shocks to return inflation to target in a manner that provides as   much support as possible to employment and growth or, if necessary, promotes financial stability.    Even more fundamentally, the lessons of the global financial crisis prompted a radical overhaul of the Bank�s   broader policy framework. The crisis exposed the limits of inflation targeting itself, notably how a healthy   focus on price stability could become a dangerous distraction. Central banks had won the war against   inflation only to lose the peace as financial vulnerabilities built remorselessly during the Great Moderation.   Price stability clearly is not a guarantee of financial stability.    With the deficiencies of the Tripartite regime1 on full and painful display, the decision was taken in 2012 to   give the Bank of England responsibility for macroprudential and microprudential supervision. Two new   independent committees, the FPC and the PRC, were created and charged with maintaining financial   stability and safety and soundness of banks and insurers, respectively. In 2016, these committees were   placed on equal footing with the MPC, underscoring the symbiotic roles that all three play in underpinning   confidence in money and in promoting the best possible macro-economic outcomes.2 Any consideration of      1     In 1997, then Chancellor Gordon Brown put in place a new system for financial regulation, with responsibility shared by three   institutions. The Bank of England was given responsibility for financial stability; the FSA was responsible for regulating individual   banks; and the Treasury dealt with legislation. This arrangement became known as the �Tripartite�.   2     In addition to the Monetary Policy, Financial Policy and Prudential Regulation Committees, the Bank is responsible for the issuance of   bank notes, provides the foundations of the payments system through RTGS, regulates systemic financial market infrastructure, and   has powers and facilities to provide wide range of liquidity to banks and other financial institutions in order to promote the continuous   functioning of the financial system during shocks. Other institutions that support confidence in the currency include legal tender status   (meaning that you cannot be sued for non-payment of debts if you offer sterling to meet them) and the insurance of deposits of up to   �85,000 at banks and building societies backed by the Government.                                                                                                                                         2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                    2   the UK�s monetary policy framework must take into account this unique and highly effective institutional   structure.    To set the stage for today�s discussions, I would like to do two things. First, I will review the conduct and   performance of inflation targeting during my time as Governor. This period, which roughly coincides with the   post-crisis recovery and which has seen more than its share of shocks and structural developments,   provides some insights to the ability of inflation targeting to deliver price stability and support macroeconomic   outcomes. I will suggest that, so far at least, inflation targeting has proven to be a framework for all seasons,   an essential part of a robust foundation for economic prosperity.    It is important not to lose sight of the fundamental success in achieving price stability that has resulted from   delegation of inflation targeting to an independent central bank. In the two decades prior to independence,   inflation averaged over 6%. Since independence, it has been close to 2% and one-fifth as volatile (Table 1).   Inflation expectations have remained well anchored throughout some of the largest economic shocks in post-   war history.    Table 1: Inflation lower and less volatile since MPC independence                                                           Four-         Four-                               Annual                    quarter     quarter GDP                           Real                                 CPI        Inflation     GDP          growth         Unemployment         wage                              Inflation     volatility   growth       volatility          rate            growth   Pre-inflation                 9.0           5.4         2.2           2.9               7.8              0.8   targeting   (1972-1992)   Start of inflation              2.3         0.4         2.9            0.7               9.0             0.3   targeting to MPC   independence (1993   � 1997 Q2)   MPC independence                1.6         0.5         3.0            0.9               5.4             0.7   to crisis   (1997Q3 �2007)   2008 � end 2012                 3.3         1.0         0.0            2.7               7.4            -0.3   2013 � present                  1.7         1.0         2.0            0.5               5.1             0.2       The bar for change to the regime is very high. But while the inflation targeting regime has generally served   the UK well since its adoption, it would be Fukuyama-esque to declare it the end of monetary history. In the   second part of my remarks therefore I would like to raise some structural challenges to monetary policy that   favour careful consideration.    Inflation targeting may have proven to be the framework for all seasons, but what if the climate is changing?                                                                                                                      3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                            3   Could deep structural changes in our economies reduce the effectiveness of the regime? Is it possible that   political economy considerations could complicate the management of monetary policy? And could these   developments merit either a substantial adjustment to inflation targeting or even the adoption of a different   monetary policy framework in the years ahead?    In what follows, I will not presume to give the answers but would suggest that a careful and deliberate   research review of the UK�s monetary policy framework is warranted. That�s why my colleagues and I look   forward to the contributions of the distinguished group assembled here today. And it�s why the Bank will   conduct a dedicated research programme over the next year, joining many of our peers around the world in   similar exercises.3 At a minimum, as I advocated in my parliamentary testimony prior to joining the Bank,4   open, periodic reviews reinforce the legitimacy and acceptance of this vital component of the UK�s   macroeconomic landscape.    Let me begin by reviewing how inflation targeting has performed in recent years.    I. Monetary �Spring� � Securing the recovery    When I joined the Bank, a long economic winter of discontent was finally beginning to thaw. Throughout   most of 2011 and 2012, UK GDP growth (at around 1�%) had languished well below its pre-crisis trend (of   close to 3%), and unemployment was about 8%. But by mid-2013, there were signs of a nascent recovery:   four-quarter growth had picked up above 2%, and the unemployment rate fell to 7.7%, its joint lowest level   since early 2009 (Charts 1a and 1b). The timing and pace of the recovery had caught most unawares.

In addition, the Bank�s   Funding for Lending Scheme provided support to activity, by improving financial conditions.    On the nominal side, UK inflation had fallen from a peak of 5.2% in September 2011 to 2.9% in June 2013   (Chart 2a), as upward pressures from the past exchange rate depreciation (and higher energy prices) eased.   Domestic inflationary pressures were subdued, with annual pay growth running around 1% (Chart 2b) � far   below its pre-crisis average rate of 4%.

But the exact extent of slack was more uncertain than usual. Productivity had fallen alongside activity during   the recession, and its reported growth had been anaemic since, averaging around half its pre-crisis rate   (Chart 3). The MPC judged that slow productivity growth was partly a result of the post-crisis weakness in   the banking system, which had been restricting the reallocation of capital and labour.5 It was not clear how   quickly productivity growth might return to pre-crisis rates as demand recovered and financial intermediation   returned to normal. But old habits die hard, there was an (ultimately misplaced) optimism that productivity   growth would pick up sharply.

In the wake of the crisis, several forces   encouraged more people to seek work and others to delay retirement, including the accumulated debt   burdens of UK households in the run-up to the crisis; increased uncertainty about future incomes in its   aftermath; changes to pension arrangements; and reforms to the UK�s welfare system. These forces meant   that labour supply was increasing, despite the persistent drag from an ageing population. Changes to the   nature of work, including the rise of the gig economy and self-employment, that gave rise to more flexible   employment opportunities, reinforced this view.    Such enormous uncertainties about supply meant knowing what was happening to demand was no longer   sufficient to gauge changes in spare capacity and therefore to set the appropriate monetary policy response.   This was a unique situation in the history of UK inflation targeting. The historic reduced-form revealed   reaction function of the Committee turned out to be based on changes to demand alone � the MPC had   always tightened policy significantly during previous periods of accelerating growth and firming business   confidence (Chart 4).

Notes: Combined CIPS output survey is a weighted average of the Markit/CIPS PMIs for services, manufacturing and construction.   Average MPC vote includes both decisions on Bank Rate and QE, with every extra �25bn of asset purchases (gilts and corporate   bonds) treated as equivalent to a 25bp cut in Bank Rate (see Joyce, Tong and Woods, 2011).     With uncertainty about supply now overwhelming uncertainty about demand, and with the strong desire to   secure a recovery in an economy that had � reportedly at least � only narrowly missed a triple dip recession,   the MPC provided forward guidance in August 2013 that explicitly linked any potential change in interest   rates to the unemployment rate. By using a clear and widely understood indicator of the degree of spare   capacity,6 the Committee sought to secure the nascent recovery while learning more about the supply   capacity of the economy. Recall that at the time fiscal consolidation continued to weigh on domestic demand,   making monetary policy the �only game in town.�     6    For the full text of the guidance, see the minutes of the August 2013 MPC meeting, available at   https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/minutes/2013/monetary-policy-committee-august-2013.                                                                                                                                    7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                             7   The message the Committee gave UK households and businesses was simple: the MPC would not even   think about tightening policy at least until the unemployment rate had fallen below 7%, consistent with the   creation of around three quarter of a million jobs. We reassured households and businesses that, after five   difficult years, the recovery would not be choked off prematurely.    On the basis of this past behaviour, the MPC would have raised interest rates by 2 to 3 percentage points   between August 2013 and the end of 2014 (Chart 5). For anyone who might suggest the MPC should have   followed its historic reaction function (and several external commentators did at the time 7), note that, even on   unchanged policy, CPI inflation in the summer of 2016 was running at only about �% and core CPI inflation   around 1�%.

In an environment of strengthening domestic activity and some external exhortations to raise interest rates,   forward guidance was effective in managing expectations. Surveys conducted in the months that followed its   introduction indicated high awareness among companies, with almost half reporting that they expected Bank   Rate to remain at low levels for longer than they would have done had guidance not been in place. And the   majority of businesses said that the Bank�s policy guidance had made them more confident about UK   economic prospects. Household expectations also shifted markedly in favour of fewer and later rate   increases (Chart 6).8 In parallel, household and business confidence continued to strengthen, reinforcing   the economic momentum.       7     For example, the IEA�s Shadow Monetary Policy Committee voted for higher rates at all of its fourteen meetings between November   2013 and December 2014.   8     For more information, see the box on page 12 of the February 2014 Inflation Report.                                                                                                                                     8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                              8   Chart 6: Households consistently expected increases in interest rates to be gradual and limited   Median household Bank Rate expectations                                                                                                                      Per cent              2014 Q1                                                                                                      6              2015 Q1                                                                                 Pre-crisis average level of                  5              2016 Q1              2017 Q1                                                                                                         4              2018 Q1                                                                                                         3                                                                                                                               2                                                                                                                               1                                                                                                                               0     0                  1                  2                 3                     4                  5                   6                                                       Years ahead    Notes: Household expectations are from the Bank/TNS Inflation Attitudes survey and show how Bank Rate is expected to increase   relative to the rate prevailing at the time. Pre-crisis average Bank Rate is calculated from 1997 to 2007 inclusive.     In the event, the unemployment rate fell far faster than the MPC had expected, falling below 7% in February   2014. But even as the recovery strengthened and survey indicators of output growth reached levels   previously associated with sharp policy tightenings, household, company and market expectations about the   future path of policy remained subdued and interest rate volatility remained low (Chart 7).

2020-03-04	"The Road to Glasgow   Speech given by   Mark Carney   Governor of the Bank of England,   Finance Adviser to the Prime Minister for COP26     Guildhall   27 February 2020       I would like to thank Jennifer Nemeth for her assistance in drafting these remarks and Jennifer Bell,   Sarah Breeden, Alice Carr, Iren Levina, Sini Matikainen and Harriet O�Brien for their input.                                                                                                            1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches   Introduction    Sir David Attenborough�s prophetic introduction has exposed the scale of the challenges and hinted at the   enormous opportunities before us. And the Secretary of State has just described the prospect of a lasting   COP 26 legacy and the opportunity for finance to be the force for good we know it can be.    Now is the time to answer these calls to action. Private finance will have a critical role to play in a successful   transition to a net zero carbon economy. With the UK COP26 Presidency, in partnership with Italy, the world   is watching.    Today is all about action. The actions the private financial sector can take to support a whole economy   transition. The actions that regulators, governments and countries will take to catalyse your efforts. The   actions that our fellow citizens are demanding, and that future generations deserve.    And you have already begun. Private finance is now increasingly focused on the opportunities and risks in   the transition. Every major systemic bank, the world�s largest insurers, its biggest pension funds and top   asset managers are calling for the disclosure of climate-related financial risk through their support of the   Taskforce for Climate-related Finance Disclosures (TCFD).1 Investors controlling over $40 trillion in assets   (across Climate Action 100+, UN PRI, and the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance) want to see transition plans to   a low carbon world from their portfolio companies. 2 This is backed by the critical roles that Multilateral   Development Banks, Development Finance Institutions and National Development Banks are playing to   accelerate their support to low carbon growth.    Achieving net zero will require a whole economy transition�every company, every bank, every insurer and   investor will have to adjust their business models. This could turn an existential risk into the greatest   commercial opportunity of our time.    As the Secretary of State said, finance is the COP 26 deliverable that �makes all the others - adaptation and   resilience, nature, energy transition and clean road transport- possible.�    The scale of these requirements are enormous: $3.5 trillion in infrastructure investment alone every year for   decades.3 All forms of finance: public, private and blended finance will play a part. Public finance to support   a fair and inclusive transition across our economies. Development and blended finance to support   adaptation and resilience. And mainstream private finance to help all companies realign their business   models for net zero.    The objective for the private finance work for COP 26 is simple: ensure that every financial decision   takes climate change into account.     1 The full list of current TCFD supporters is available at: https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/tcfd-supporters/.   2     See https://www.unpri.org/signatories, http://www.climateaction100.org/investors, https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-alliance/.   3     https://www.iea.org/news/deep-energy-transformation-needed-by-2050-to-limit-rise-in-global-temperature.                                                                                                                                    2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                             2   To do so, we will work with you � the private sector � to put in place the frameworks so that you can do what   you do best � allocate capital to manage risks and seize opportunities across the economy.    Determining who�s ready for the transition and who�s not requires:         1. Disclosure of climate financial risk to become comprehensive;         2. Climate risk management to be transformed; and         3. Investing for a net-zero world to go mainstream.    On the road to Glasgow, we will focus on the three Rs: reporting; risk management; and return - to help   unlock the private financial flows that are vital to the transition. This will support a wider shift to Paris   alignment and be underpinned by public finance efforts to deliver $100bn.    To succeed we will need your support and your action. We will publish the strategy and how you can get   involved when I formally assume my new roles, but following Sir David�s lead, I wanted to offer you an   exclusive preview today.    Reporting: improving the quantity and quality of climate-related disclosures by implementing a common   framework built on TCFD    An old adage is that which is measured can be managed.    For COP 26 we want you to help refine and implement TCFD disclosure; and we will work with   authorities to commit to pathways to make climate reporting mandatory.    We will build on existing good work. Catalysed by the G20 and the Paris COP, the private sector has   already led the development of a framework for climate financial reporting through the TCFD. 4 The TCFD   has become the go-to standard for consistent, comparable and decision-useful and efficient information. It is   comprehensive, encompassing recommendations on governance, strategy and risk management, as well as   metrics and targets.5 And most importantly, it represents the best views of the private sector of what is   decision useful, capturing the opinions of both the companies that must access finance and of the providers   of capital from across the financial system.       4The 2017 recommendations report is available at https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/publications/final-recommendations-report/.   5    The TCFD is the only reporting framework to all each of these strands for both banks and investors:   https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/files/downloads/Overview-Initiatives-Shaping-Climate-Action-Journey-for-FIs.pdf.                                                                                                                             3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                      3   The TCFD has widespread public backing from across the financial sector. 6 Every major systemic bank,   nine of the ten top asset managers, all the credit rating agencies, all major accounting firms and shareholder   advisory firms back the TCFD. In January this year, the International Business Council (IBC) of 140 CEOs   published a report on a common set of metrics that IBC members signed up to, which included TCFD.7 And   the UNPRI announced that all 2,275 signatories must make TCFD disclosures or risk ejection from the   group.    The institutions like yours will be the main users of this information. You have the opportunity to shape these   disclosures as they become market standards. We encourage the private sector to:         1. Contribute to the review of the current TCFD framework that Mary Schapiro is leading. Tell her             what�s important, what�s less so, what should be refined to ensure disclosures are decision-useful,             comparable, consistent and efficient before they become mandatory.         2. Commit to reporting a full set of TCFD disclosures in the 2021/22 reporting round: The self-             help community for TCFD is considerable. Through multi-sector TCFD summits and more focused             TCFD industry preparer forums, companies can continue to share knowledge to improve disclosure             practices.8 Full disclosure encompasses scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and includes a strategy for             managing these down, embedded through appropriate board-level governance structures and linking             outcomes to compensation.9         3. Demand TCFD-consistent disclosures from your borrowers and the portfolio companies. In             the process, you will unleash tremendous value and be better able to manage embedded risks.    For COP 26 we will work to develop pathways, in consultation with international standard setters - such as   the FSB, IFRS and IOSCO � and national authorities to determine the best approaches to making climate   disclosure mandatory.    Risk management: ensuring firms and investors can measure and manage the risks in the transition to a   net zero world.    The second step on the path to a sustainable financial system is better climate risk management.    Managing climate-related financial risks requires disclosure to go beyond the static (a company�s carbon   footprint today) to the strategic (their plans to manage down their emissions). Risk management means   assessing the forward-looking disclosures to judge the resilience of firms� strategies to the transition.     6 The full list of current TCFD supporters is available at: https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/tcfd-supporters/.   7 https://www.weforum.org/press/2020/01/measuring-stakeholder-capitalism-world-s-largest-companies-support-developing-core-set-of-   universal-esg-disclosures/.   8 https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Redefining-Value/External-Disclosure/TCFD.   9 Scope 1 means all direct emissions from the activities of an organisation.    Scope 2 means indirect emissions from electricity purchased and used by the organisation.   Scope 3 means all other Indirect emissions from activities of the organisation, occurring from sources that they do not own or control.                                                                                                                                             4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                      4   To this end, the Bank of England will become the first regulator to stress test its major banks and insurers   against different climate pathways, including the catastrophic business-as-usual scenario, the ideal - but still   challenging - transition to net zero by 2050, and the late policy action - or climate Minsky moment � scenario   that could bring a sudden recognition of the scale of stranded assets and the economy-wide disruption that a   delayed and disorderly transition will bring.10    Our stress test of the world�s leading international financial centre will show how major financial firms expect   to adjust their business models, as well as the potential collective impact of these responses on the wider   economy.    The stress test will reveal the financial firms - and by extension the companies - that are preparing for the   transition, and it will expose those that have not.    The Bank�s stress test will build on the scenarios being developed by the Network for Greening the Financial   System (NGFS) � a coalition of over 50 central banks, representing half of the world�s emissions.11 This   spring, the NGFS will make these scenarios open source and publicly available, so that any company, in any   sector, can use them to assess their strategic resilience.    To embed climate-risk management, we�re encouraging the financial sector and our international peers to:         1. Help shape the climate stress testing framework, which Sam Woods will describe later this             morning, by sharing your expertise and responding to the approach that the Bank has put forward in             its discussion paper.12         2. Start building capability within your firms. Expertise in managing the physical and transition risks             associated with climate change will be a core competency for banks and insurers.         3. Share knowledge and expertise. Climate risk management is a nascent field, and we all need             rapidly to improve our skills. That�s why the Bank and the FCA have established the Climate             Financial Risk Forum (CFRF) to publish the sector�s collective view of risk management and             scenario analysis best practice.13         4. Run stress tests in other jurisdictions. Already, 15 other authorities have committed to run stress             tests. Through the NGFS, the Bank of England will share our experience so that others can conduct             stress tests for their own financial systems. This will help improve and refine the methodology.       10 https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2019/december/boe-consults-on-proposals-for-stress-testing-the-financial-stability-implications-of-   climate-change.   11 https://www.banque-france.fr/en/financial-stability/international-role/network-greening-financial-system.   12 https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2019/biennial-exploratory-scenario-climate-change-discussion-paper.   13      CFRF members include banks, insurers, asset managers, and other organisations with a strong interest. The working groups include industry   groups to ensure a wide range of views is reflected. https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/climate-change/climate-financial-risk-forum.                                                                                                                                                  5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                                           5        5. Embed assessment of climate risks into financial stability analysis: where the FSB is taking              forward work, drawing on the advances made by its members as well as the NGFS. 14    Return: helping firms and investors identify the opportunities in the transition to net zero.    The transition to net zero will affect every sector of our economies, and all companies that are transitioning to   net zero should be encouraged.    In parallel, with people increasingly demanding climate action, asset owners and managers will need to   disclose whether their clients� money is being invested in line with their values�a point Richard Curtis will   make much more eloquently and forcefully later this morning.    Thus far, the approaches to doing so have been inadequate. ESG metrics�while worthy�are dominated by   the S and the G. Carbon footprints are not forward-looking. And the impact of shareholder engagement is   hard to measure. Moreover, a whole economy transition isn�t about funding only deep green activities or   blacklisting dark brown ones. We need fifty shades of green to catalyse and support all companies towards   net zero and be able to assess collectively whether we�re �Paris aligned�.    Given that net zero is both an imperative of climate physics and a commitment by 120 countries; companies,   banks, insurers, pension funds and investors will increasingly be expected to develop and disclose their   transition plans. For companies that could mean:         ?     Commitment to a net zero target (for scope 1, 2 and ideally scope 3 emissions) by a specific date;          ?     Assessment and disclosure of how the transition to a net zero business model will impact strategy;          ?     Short term milestones to track progress; and         ?     Details of governance, including whether executive compensation is tied to success and how risks              are managed at the board level.    In turn, there are several possible ways for the providers of capital to assess the level of preparedness for   the transition. To support the assessment of who is on the right side of history and therefore presents the   most promising investment opportunities in the transition, providers of capital could measure and disclose:         1. The percentage of assets that comply with TCFD disclosure;         2. The percentage of assets that are Net Zero-aligned (�Paris aligned�);       14See e.g. Giuzio, M. et al.

Progress on transition as assessed against industry-specific transition pathways to help           identify the leaders and laggards in the transition; and        4. Degree warming potential of the portfolio, which assesses the quality of transition plans relative           to the Paris goals. Firms such as Aviva, Axa and Allianz have already voluntarily disclosed this           information. They are now feeding into a TCFD group that is considering whether the warming           potential, or any other metric, is the best way to measure the potential opportunities in the transition.    For COP 26, we intend to leverage the success of existing groups and coalitions, like the Net Zero Asset   Owner alliance, Climate Action 100+ and the UN PRI to build a large coalition of asset owners and asset   managers who expect their portfolio companies to become Net Zero aligned.    MDBs and Innovative Finance    The work on reporting, risk and returns will put in place the foundations for private finance to help drive the   transition to net zero, but much more must be done across the full spectrum of the financial sector.    Multilateral Development Banks and Development Finance Institutions have essential roles in mobilising   blended finance for adaptation, resilience and mitigation, especially in the communities most exposed to the   devastating effects of climate change. As the Secretary of State noted, we will be asking these institutions to   develop robust implementation plans for Paris Alignment in the run up to COP26.    We will also consider how to best channel the expertise, experience and ingenuity of the financial sector to   develop innovative approaches to meet the biggest challenges in the transition to net zero. This will mean:        1. Understanding which new financial products, such as transition bonds and transition indices, can           make a real difference to climate finance and support efforts to scale them up rapidly as needed.        2. Promoting the most promising climate innovations in insurance sector, such as contingent liability           structures for climate policy risk and micro- insurance in emerging economies, drawing on the           leadership of organisations such as the CCRI and IDF; and        3. Evaluating the prospects for private markets in carbon offsets and nature-based solutions, drawing           on the sector�s expertise in creating and running efficient and transparent market infrastructure.    Conclusion    With sustainable finance moving from CSR to the C suite, the UK COP 26 Presidency in partnership with   Italy will help build the foundations of a system that will be able to seize the opportunities of transitioning to   net zero.                                                                                                                         7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                              7   The UK has been at the forefront of innovation for centuries.

Introduction    Economists suffer from physics envy.    We covet its neat equations and crave its deterministic systems.    This inevitably leads to disappointment.    The economy isn�t deterministic. People aren�t always rational. Human creativity, frailty, exuberance and   pessimism all contribute to economic and financial cycles.    As the great physicist, Sir Isaac Newton, lamented, �I can calculate the motions of celestial bodies, but not   the madness of people.�    Newton�s exasperation came after he had lost a fortune investing in the South Sea company, or, with the   wisdom of hindsight - after he had speculated on a bubble.    Just as people can go from rational to �mad� in a boom, theoretical physics itself isn�t quite as neat as   Newton had thought, for it has been discovered that Newtonian mechanics break down at the subatomic   level.    But physicists are not easily daunted. Their hottest fields, such as String Theory, are part of a quest for a   theory that unifies Newton and the neutron�a Grand Unifying Theory of Everything that Matters. One that   can explain the motions of both heavenly bodies and subatomic particles.    I am on a similar quest this evening. My topic is one of the hottest fields in economic policy�   macroprudential policy. A field that has something in common with Newton, for part of the responsibilities of   macroprudential policy is to protect the economy from the madness of people.    Macroprudential policy is as core to the responsibilities of central banks as their much better known twin,   monetary policy. Both are fundamental to the value of money.    The relative simplicity of the monetary policy objective and the relatively focused arsenal of monetary   policymakers improve the likelihood that agents in the economy can understand the MPC�s reaction function   and anticipate its actions, making its job of achieving price stability somewhat easier. 1    This evening I would like to improve the understanding of the FPC�s reaction function by placing its   objectives and policies in a more consistent theoretical framework. A common framework can better explain   seemingly disparate macroprudential policies and can guide future policy actions. This will be important if,   as has happened all too frequently in the past, either a prolonged period of growth or the emergence of new     1See �Guidance, Contingencies and Brexit�, speech by Mark Carney given at the Society of Professional Economists, 24   May 2018.                                                                                                                    2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                               2   era thinking threaten to take financial stability for granted once again, thereby sowing the seeds of a future   crisis.     II.       The Triumph (and Tragedy) of Monetary Policy    Newton famously and humbly observed, �If I have seen farther, it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.�   So too it is with macroprudential policy, a framework that owes a great debt to insights and initiatives of my   predecessor, Lord King.    The UK�s macroprudential policy framework today stands on the shoulder of the UK�s monetary policy   framework first set up in 1998.    In the UK, from 1971 to 1992, inflation was high - averaging 9%, and volatile, with a standard deviation of   5.4%. This distorted price signals, inhibited investment, damaged the productive potential of the economy,   and hurt those least well-off. It contributed to high and volatile unemployment, which averaged 7.8% with a   standard deviation of 2.8%.    Although the value of low and stable inflation was widely recognised, delivering it proved challenging.    This was because the instrument that affects inflation most powerfully � monetary policy � also affects output   and employment, at least in the short run. This tempted authorities, influenced by governments, to promise   low inflation in the future, but then to renege in order to boost activity. Electoral cycles reinforced this   predisposition. Firms and households began to anticipate these incentives, and eventually pre-empt them.    This time inconsistency was resolved by first having society choose the preferred rate of inflation, and then   delegating operational responsibility to the monetary authority to take the necessary monetary actions to   achieve that objective. By �tying the hands� of authorities, better outcomes for both inflation and   unemployment became possible.    The Bank of England Act in 1998 represented the most comprehensive adoption of these insights. The Act   clarified the Bank�s responsibilities, encoded in the MPC�s remit, and granted independence to the Bank for   the operation of monetary policy. In delegating authority to an independent body, the Act ensured the Bank   would operate under �constrained� rather than �unfettered� discretion. It would be accountable to Parliament   for operating the instruments of monetary policy to achieve the objectives of monetary policy, as determined   by the Government. 2                                            �        �       �        �        �   The MPC�s current monetary policy remit requires it to achieve price stability, defined by the Government as   12-month CPI inflation of 2%. This inflation target is symmetric and applies at all times.    2For further information, see �Lambda�, speech by Mark Carney given at the London School of Economics, 16 January   2017, and �A Framework for All Seasons?�, speech by Mark Carney given at the Bank of England Research Workshop   on The Future of Inflation Targeting, 9 January 2020.                                                                                                                    3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                             3   The remit also recognises that inflation may deviate temporarily from the target on account of shocks, and   since 2013 it explicitly recognises that in these circumstances, bringing inflation back to target too rapidly   could cause volatility in output and employment that is undesirable. The remit requires the MPC to consider,   balance and explain such short-run monetary policy trade-offs.    The manner in which the MPC optimises these trade-offs can be represented in �linear-quadratic� form � a   set of linear constraints describing the behaviour of the economy, and quadratic preferences that penalise   deviations of inflation from its target and output from its potential. The relative weight the policymaker places   on output stabilisation, relative to inflation stabilisation, is often denoted ?? � or �lambda�.    The policymaker�s objective function can be described as the following �loss function�:                                                    ??                                                                             ?                              min ??? ? ???? {? ?? ?? [(????+?? ? ?? ? )2 + ?(????+?? ? ????+?? )2 ]}                            {????+?? }??                                   ??=0                                                 ??=??               where ???? is inflation, ?? ? is the inflation target, ???? is output and ????? is �trend� output, so that ???? ? ????? is           the output gap, ???? is the nominal interest rate � the policy instrument, ?? is the discount factor and ??           subscripts denote time periods. ?? is 3-5 years after which the monetary policy transmission           mechanism fades.    The policymaker�s objective is to minimise the discounted sum of losses over time.    In this formulation, a lambda of zero would imply no weight on the stabilisation of real activity � so-called   �inflation nutter� preferences. When lambda is positive, the policymaker is willing to strike some trade-off   between output and inflation stabilisation, as directed by the MPC remit.    This objective function is optimised subject to the constraints implied by the aggregate behaviour of the   economy, including the relationship between interest rates and activity; and the relationship between activity   and inflation � the Phillips curve.    Under this simple framework, in certain circumstances, the optimal policy balances overshoots of the inflation   target with shortfalls of activity relative to potential, and vice versa for inflation undershoots. The relative size   of these two deviations is governed by the strength with which higher output translates into higher inflation;   and the preferences of the policymaker, or:                                                             ?                                                ???? ? ?? ? = ? (???? ? ????? )                                                            ?                                                                                                                                 4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                      4   where ? is the slope of the Philips curve, the effect of the output gap on inflation. 3    From this, it is clear that the higher is lambda, the greater the weight placed on output stabilisation and the   more a given shock is allowed to flow through to inflation. As lambda shrinks to zero, the policymaker forces   all of the adjustment to a shock through the output gap in order to keep inflation very close to the target.    The slope of the trade-off is also affected by that of the Phillips curve. When the Phillips curve is flatter, a   given output gap results in a larger inflation over- or under-shoot. Intuitively, a flat Phillips curve raises the   output costs associated with changing inflation.                                               �         �       �         �      �   Such inflation-targeting frameworks, adopted around the world, have been highly successful. Two decades   prior to monetary policy independence in the UK, inflation averaged over 6% (Table 1). Since independence,   it has been close to 2% and one-fifth as volatile. The unemployment rate fell by around 2 percentage points   in the post-independence period. Its standard deviation was cut in half. And fifteen years of sustained   economic growth followed.

Against this   serene backdrop of �the Great Moderation�, a storm was brewing.       3This is the time-consistent optimal policy in the textbook New-Keynesian model with purely forward-looking IS and   Phillips curves. See Clarida, R, Gali, J and Gertler, M (1999), �The Science of Monetary Policy: A New Keynesian   Perspective�, Journal of Economic Literature, December.                                                                                                                         5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                        5   The changes adopted by many central banks around the world in the late 1990s effectively narrowed their   focus, reflecting the belief that price stability was the best contribution a central bank could make to   macroeconomic stability, and by extension to the broader public good.    Although there were tremendous innovations during this period, this reductionist vision of a central bank�s   role was structurally flawed.    In particular, this narrow focus failed to recognise that financial stability is as important an objective of   macroeconomic policy as price stability.    Central banks have a vital role in maintaining financial stability because of the deep underlying connection   between it and monetary stability. Both are fundamentally about maintaining the public trust and confidence   in money and the financial intermediation that is essential to oil the wheels of commerce. That trust and   confidence can be undermined through a loss of certainty about the future value of money, a loss of   confidence in financial intermediaries, or ultimately a loss of faith in the financial system.    The financial crisis was a powerful reminder of the imperative of financial stability. After years of low and   stable inflation, it became obvious that central banks had won the war only to lose the peace.    The costs were enormous. The complete loss of confidence in private finance that occurred in 2008 could   only be arrested by public support that totalled $15 trillion in bail-outs, government guarantees of bank   liabilities and special central bank liquidity schemes. In the UK, real wages have just surpassed their 2007   level. Trust in the system collapsed.    In the wake of the crisis, the traditional model of central banking was reinstated and modernised.    In the UK, monetary and financial stability were re-united at the Bank of England when the Chancellor in   2010 created the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) and granted it responsibility for setting macroprudential   policy.    Operating monetary and financial stability functions within the same institution improve information   synergies, and policy coordination. And it boosts the credibility of each policy function, amplifying their   effectiveness since each can focus on their comparative advantage - monetary policy on demand   management and macroprudential policy on systemic stability.                                                                                                                       6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                            6   III.     The Advent of Macroprudential Policy    The raison d��tre of macroprudential policy is to ensure the financial system supports the economy.    That requires the financial system to be strong enough to continue lending to households and businesses   when economic shocks occur. And it means that macroeconomic downturns are not made worse because of   unsustainable debt burdens.4    To accomplish these goals, macroprudential authorities concentrate on systemic risks � that is, those large   enough to materially impact growth. Such systemic risks fall broadly into two camps: cyclical and structural.    Cyclical risks are the tendencies for financial conditions to loosen and debt to build up over time when the   economy strengthens and people become more complacent. This cycle typically starts with a fundamentally   positive development, such as new markets or a new technology of broad application. The ensuing period of   prosperity and macroeconomic stability leads borrowers and lenders to make increasingly optimistic   assumptions about the future such as �house prices can only go up� or �financial innovation has reduced   risk.� Debt and asset prices build, reinforcing each other for a time.    The resulting vulnerabilities are only exposed when economic conditions turn. When they do, lenders hastily   revise their expectations for the future � the �Minksy moment� � and pull back on lending. Borrowers reduce   spending, or in extremis, default. These responses make the economic downturn much deeper and more   prolonged.    Structural risks are systemic risks that do not vary with the cycle. They generally relate to interconnections   and concentrations within the financial system but can also arise from the structure of financial contracts or   regulations.    For example, if financial institutions have a web of exposures to each other, an issue at one institution can   set off a chain-reaction through the system. Or if several firms are exposed to the same market, problems in   that market can be amplified because of how these firms react. Risks will also be higher if structurally weak   investment vehicles, prone to fire sale their assets, play a meaningful role in important markets. And   structurally deficient market infrastructure increases the complexity and opaqueness of markets, making   risks harder to identify.    Over the past decade, a flurry of macroprudential policy actions have been taken to address the fault lines   that caused the crisis including raising bank capital minima and buffers, introducing liquidity buffers for   banks, reducing bank interconnectedness and improving their resolvability, targeted restrictions on mortgage       4 Macroprudential policy is distinct from microprudential policy. Microprudential policy concentrates on promoting the   safety and soundness of individual institutions. Macroprudential policy addresses risks arising from interactions between   institutions and sectors within the financial system, and interactions between the financial system and the real economy.                                                                                                                         7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                    7   lending, transforming fragile OTC derivative markets, and winding down the toxic forms of shadow banking   and building up more resilient market-based finance (Chart 1).5     And with these policies have come a flurry of speeches too (Chart 2).

What do these actions have in common? What guides the choice of macroprudential policy tools   and their calibration? Is there a unifying framework that articulates success for macroprudential   policy?    There are several reasons why defining a unifying framework for macroprudential policy is more complex   than for monetary policy.    First, the gravitational pull of monetary policy is greater because its performance is easier to monitor. But   whereas the objective of monetary policy�price stability�is readily and frequently observed, the objective of   macroprudential policy�financial stability�is most easily defined in its absence. Financial stability is the   opposite of the financial instability of bust, crises and panics.6    Second, macroprudential policymakers deploy a large number of very different tools in order to address a   wide range of systemic risks.   5 See �True Finance � Ten years after the financial crisis�, speech by Mark Carney given at the Economic Club of New   York, 19 October 2018.   6 While most definitions of financial stability are based on its absence, a positive definition of financial stability would be    the sustainable provision of financial services, and confidence in the financial system to withstand future shocks without   major disruption to those services, where these are integral to the real economy�s pursuit of strong and sustainable   economic growth.                                                                                                                                8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                           8   In contrast, in the pursuit of price stability, central banks deploy a handful of policies, primarily changes in   interest rates and purchases of assets, that all relate to the current and future price of money.    Third, the time horizons are different. The costs of macroprudential interventions can be felt today but their   benefits are often realised far into the future.    And fourth, these benefits � moderating downturns and avoiding crises � are not directly observable. The   bad outcomes that macroprudential policies prevent have to be estimated. But counterfactuals are difficult to   sell: �it could have been worse� doesn�t quite have the ring of �you�ve never had it so good.�    All these complexities and uncertainties make it challenging to implement macroprudential policies and   harder to communicate the rationales for them. Over time, and particularly during good times, these   challenges can feed a bias towards inaction. As memories of the last crisis fade, complacency sets in and   pressures to ease policies re-emerge. When it comes to financial stability, success is an orphan.    These tendencies can be exacerbated by similar time inconsistency problems to those that plague monetary   policy. Lighter-touch regulation can be a powerful tool for authorities to boost near-term growth, a temptation   that is reinforced by governments motivated by electoral cycles and the complacency curve of the financial   cycle. In the long-run, the cost of such indulgence is financial and macroeconomic instability, bringing fiscal   strains, lower growth, and higher unemployment.    It is not surprising that across 800 years of economic history, financial crises occur roughly once a decade   (Chart 3).    Chart 3: Financial crises occur with fairly regular frequency   Proportion of countries with banking crises, weighted by share of world income       Sources: Reproduced from Reinhart, C, and Rogoff, K (2013), �Banking crises: An equal opportunity menace�, Journal of   Banking and Finance, vol 37(11), pp. 4557-4573                                                                                                                         9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                9   Creating a unifying framework for macroprudential policy can help to break this dreary cycle, guide   policymakers and improve the understanding and effectiveness of macroprudential policy. It can also   promote self-reinforcing behaviour within the private financial sector, just as with credible monetary policy.   And a clearer framework will improve the transparency and accountability of the FPC to parliament and the   people we serve.    IV.        Grand Unifying Theory of Macroprudential Policy    The FPC is accountable to Parliament for operating the instruments of macroprudential policy to achieve the   objectives of macroprudential policy, as determined by the Government. Society chooses the ends, and,   within pre-set boundaries, the FPC determines the means to achieve them.    The FPC framework mirrors that of the MPC because of the time-inconsistency problems. The (often) long   lag between boosting growth today and the damage it does in the future makes an even stronger case for   delegating operational responsibility for macroprudential policy to an independent authority than for monetary   policy.    The FPC�s responsibilities are encoded in the Bank of England Act and the Chancellor�s annual FPC remit   letter.7    The FPC�s primary objective is to identify, monitor and take action to remove or reduce systemic risks with a   view to protecting and enhancing the resilience of the UK�s financial system.8    Subject to meeting their primary objective, the FPC has a secondary objective to �support the economic   policy of Her Majesty�s Government, including its objectives for growth and employment�.    The emphasis on supporting economic growth over the medium to long term is underpinned by the so-called   �stability of the graveyard clause� in the Bank of England Act, which does not �required or authorised the   Committee to exercise its functions in a way that would in its opinion be likely to have a significant adverse   effect on the capacity of the financial sector to contribute to the growth of the UK economy in the medium or   long term�.    The FPC�s actions support its secondary objective in several ways. The FPC minimises the negative impact   of financial stability policies on growth including in the near-term by implementing financial stability policies   gradually, and by choosing targeted policy tools.    The FPC�s remit letter also tasks the FPC with taking actions to promote actively productive finance and   growth as long as these actions do not compromise the primary objective of financial stability. These actions    7 The Chancellor�s annual �Remit and Recommendations� letters to the FPC, alongside the FPC�s responses, are   available here.   8 The Chancellor�s annual remit letter sets out that the ultimate purpose of pursuing this objective is that �a strong and    stable financial system supports economic growth, facilitates the provision of finance to support the expansion of the   economy�s productive capacity and underpins the UK�s position as an important global financial centre�.                                                                                                                                10     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                          10   could include those that increase the efficiency of financial services, level the playing field between existing   firms and new entrants, or that support the development of new products and markets.    The FPC�s setting of macroprudential policy can be broadly characterised as minimising the loss function, ?:                                                           ??                                        min ? ? ???? {? ?? ??

(�) < 0 and ?? ?? (�) > 0.    The FPC�s primary objective is captured by the first term, ??@????+?? , �GDP-at-risk�.9 This is the far-left tail of   the forecast distribution of GDP, and is a summary measure of the impact of tail risks on the economy.   GDP-at-risk can be thought of as the consequence of financial instability.10    ????????+?? is the central GDP forecast, which will over time be determined by the economy�s trend rate of   growth. This will be influenced in the medium to long term by macroprudential policies that impact the   efficiency of the financial system and through it aggregate productivity.                                               �       �         �       �       �    Comparing the FPC�s objective function with the more familiar monetary policy objective function helps   illustrate the operation of macroprudential policy:        1. Clarity of objectives. The primary objective of the FPC, financial stability, can only be estimated;           whereas that of the MPC, inflation, can be readily measured. As a consequence, FPC performance           is best judged in the short term by intermediate indicators and drivers of financial stability;        2. Impact on growth. Although both committees are tasked with promoting the government�s           economic objectives subject to achievement of their primary objectives, the MPC has very limited           ability to influence trend growth. The MPC�s trade-offs, when they occur, are to limit excessive short           term volatility in output and inflation, particularly in �exceptional circumstances,� circumstances that           only extend modestly the policy horizon. In contrast, the FPC is more likely to face trade-offs           between short term growth and its actions to achieve its primary objective. And the FPC can have     9 The recent interest in this concept is based on work by Tobias Adrian and co-authors (Adrian, T, Boyarchenko, N and   Giannone, D (2019), �Vulnerable Growth�, American Economic Review, 109(4)). For a discussion, see this article by   Steve Cecchetti and Kim Schoenholtz.   10 Throughout this speech, deteriorations / worse outcomes for GDP-at-risk are referred to as when GDP-at-risk is    increasing / high. Conversely, throughout this speech, more favourable outcomes are when GDP-at-risk is smaller / low.                                                                                                                       11     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                 11           potentially important impacts on longer term trend growth, both because financial crises have           permanent scarring effects and because promoting productive finance can improve longer run           productivity.        3. Time horizon. The time horizon for FPC optimisation is longer than that of the MPC reflecting the           longer duration of the financial cycle, the permanent impact of structural macroprudential policies,           and long-run monetary neutrality. Whereas the impacts of macroprudential policy could easily extend           out a decade; in practice, the relevant time horizon for monetary policy would rarely extend beyond           3-5 years.

It has meant no cricket for us until last week, and in the US still no baseball. And to prove that we   share an obsession with summer pastimes, a former colleague from many years ago when I was seconded   to the New York Fed gave me a book to read called �How Life Imitates the World Series�.     Sadly, my speech cannot match that for importance. But a more recent summer tradition has been speaking   on Libor, a now annual event for the past few years � but one I do not expect to be a permanent fixture.     The time is fast approaching to draw stumps on the Libor benchmark, or for those to whom cricket is a   mystery � after all not everyone appreciates a sport that can last five days and still end in a draw � we will   soon be at the bottom of the ninth for Libor. Though from experience, I know the bottom of the ninth can last   for eternity in a close baseball game.     The continued importance of the transition away from Libor     Public authorities and market participants across jurisdictions have now been working together to transition   away from reliance on Libor for a number of years. Its weaknesses were originally exposed during the global   financial crisis and while reforms have improved the governance and administration of the rate, the markets   on which it is based have long since shrunk to a trickle of transactions. We see little prospect of those   markets returning.     Plans now need to be in place to transition from Libor to alternative reference rates by end 2021. John and I   will speak about the progress that has been made. With 18 months to go these plans must now be acted   upon in the time remaining.     With the authorities, businesses and households all having to adapt to the challenges of lockdown and new   ways of working, there have been calls to step back from the Libor transition as a priority. We understand   the level of disruption there has been and central banks have worked to ensure financial institutions have   had the support and capacity to be able to ensure a continued flow of financing to support the economy. But   in my view, what we saw in financial markets in March in response to the shock of Covid only reinforces the   importance of removing the financial system�s dependence on Libor in a timely way.       1    �Cardus on Cricket: A Selection from the Cricket Writing of Sir Neville Cardus� Souvenir Press                                                                                                                     2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                             2   Fundamentally, this is due to the fact that Libor is trying to measure a market � the market for unsecured   wholesale term lending to banks � that is no longer sufficiently active. The low levels of underlying activity   make it fragile and more susceptible to liquidity and amplification effects in financial markets.     In the three-month sterling Libor rate, which is commonly referenced in many loan agreements in the UK, the   proportion of �transaction based� submissions only rose above 10% of relevant data supporting that rate once   in the year up to March.2 In the week of 16 March this year, as central bank policy rates were reduced to   historically low levels, making cheaper funding available to banks, �transaction based� submissions in   three-month sterling Libor fell to zero.3 Over half of the 35 published Libor rates across all currencies   contained no transaction based submissions at all during that same week. At the same time Libor rates, and   therefore costs for borrowers, spiked upwards based on firms� expert judgement.     By contrast, the value of transactions underpinning SONIA, the chosen alternative in sterling markets,   increased from an average of around �40 billion per day to over �60 billion in April.     Now let me emphasise, as I have said before, we have no reason to believe there is misconduct related to   the Libor rates today. However, the low level of transactions and heavy reliance on expert judgement does   impact its robustness and sustainability. These are rates which directly impact the cash flows and values of   an estimated $400trn of financial products globally. While most of this relates to derivative market activity,   this is not an issue limited to professional investors � it impacts every company and household with a Libor   linked product.     The necessity for change     So the paradox of Libor is that if we are looking for a robust way to create transparency on bank funding   costs, Libor is not that rate. Because the market it measures is a small to disappearing part of overall bank   funding, it can no longer claim to accurately reflect the marginal cost of funds for banks, nor to provide end   users with confidence their interest payments are directly linked to those costs.     It is a common human trait to state proudly �I�m sticking to what I know�, as though familiarity can itself   outweigh the benefits of change or hide the weaknesses of the status quo. However, the market volatility we   saw during March and April only served to underscore the long-standing weaknesses of the Libor       2     Libor submissions are classified in three levels. Level 1 is �transaction-based� submissions � an average of transactions in unsecured   deposits and primary issuances of commercial paper and certificates of deposit. Level 2 is �transaction-derived� data, including   information from historical transactions. Level 3 is �expert judgement� � where a panel bank has insufficient Level 1 or 2 transactions, it   estimates the rate at which it could fund itself in the unsecured wholesale funding market, based on an approved procedure.

Libor rates � and hence costs for borrowers � rose as central bank policy rates fell to support   the economy.4     It is logical that credit spreads on bank debt (a measure of perceived risks in lending to banks) should   increase during periods of stress. It is also unsurprising for banks to be attracted to the idea of being able to   pass that cost directly onto their customers, but it does raise an important question:     Given this cost is passed directly onto borrowers through the interest rates they pay, how well does that rate   actually reflect the cost of bank funding?     There have been significant changes to the way banks fund themselves since the global financial crisis,   making them more robust. Regulatory changes have significantly reduced dependence on the fickle short-   term unsecured markets that Libor measures.5 We have seen the benefits of those reforms through the first   half of this year as banks have continued to lend and markets have remained open. And central bank   facilities such as the Bank of England�s Term Funding Scheme have offered a cost effective source of   funding to support additional lending to the real economy, providing insurance against adverse conditions in   bank funding markets.     These changes have led many banks to choose simply not to borrow in unsecured markets as the costs   increase. Overall, this leaves Libor rates capturing (at best) only a tiny fraction of overall funding costs even   in benign market conditions. As transactions become scarce during periods of stress, this reduces yet   further. For example, during March and April Libor rates were impacted by liquidity mismatches in money   market activity. Money Market Funds, that are important investors in unsecured bank funding markets,   experienced large outflows, the so called �dash for cash�. This meant Libor linked borrowers were   immediately exposed to a sharp increase in rates driven by these more esoteric liquidity factors in addition to   any perceived changes in bank credit risk.     When the banks that provide the data on which the Libor rates are based can�t reference actual transactions   that they have undertaken, they are asked to provide Libor�s administrator with a submission based on   transactions in other markets, where they are able. More commonly though, those data aren�t available   either, so they have to rely on �expert judgement� which is an estimate of the rates that the firm would expect   to pay in those wholesale unsecured funding markets.     It is simply not desirable for spikes in Libor rates, which banks are largely insulated from in terms of their own   cost of funding, to nevertheless result in those costs being passed directly onto businesses and households.     4    Interim Financial Stability Report, May 2020 � Box 1 The continued importance of the transition away from Libor,   https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/financial-stability-report/2020/may-2020.pdf   5    For example see How Correlated is Libor with bank Funding Costs? https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/how-   correlated-is-libor-with-bank-funding-costs-20200629.htm                                                                                                                                    4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                             4   The factors impacting Libor can be far removed from the risks reflected in the borrower�s own credit   worthiness and can introduce significant, and for many impenetrable, volatility in interest rates. Financial   markets should not amplify these risks and pass them through to the real economy.     So what�s the alternative?     So if Libor isn�t a robust and transparent basis for determining funding costs for firms and households � is it   possible to create such a benchmark that is sufficiently robust?     Well, some years ago now, working groups made up of industry participants in Libor jurisdictions   recommended near risk-free rates as the alternative. And more recently we have seen the market develop   products using these rates. It is a fact that homes and businesses with loans linked to these rates have seen   greater direct benefit from the action taken by central banks during the Covid disruption and have not been   as exposed to movements in Libor rates impacted by the scarcity of underlying transactions. Many more   deserve the same protection.     There is no one size fits all approach, and while there is a common view across jurisdictions that liquidity   should move to overnight near risk-free rates where appropriate, this is not to exclude the use of other robust   benchmarks.     There is a workstream under the US working group � the ARRC6 � that is currently looking at the potential to   develop alternative dollar reference rates that include a credit-sensitive spread element, perhaps as an   alternative or add-on to the new near risk-free rate across a subset of products.     But market demand for credit-sensitive rates that seek to reflect changes in bank funding costs and directly   pass these on to borrowers cannot come at the expense of ensuring those rates are sufficiently robust.   Introducing new approaches that simply replicate the inherent weaknesses of Libor would be a failure.     Would-be producers of such rates face the challenge of doing so in markets where liquidity may be thin or   variable. Those choosing to use such rates would need to understand the exposure they were taking on to   the liquidity conditions in those markets, and the volatility in the benchmark rate this could cause. We will   continue to work domestically and internationally to prevent financial markets being materially exposed to   risks from fragile benchmarks in terms of both the integrity of those rates and ensuring continuity of   provision.       6    The Alternative Reference Rate Committee is a group of private market participants convened by the Federal Reserve Board and New   York fed to help ensure transition from U.S. dollar Libor.                                                                                                                                 5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                            5   Adapting to the impact of Covid     Despite Covid, work on transition in sterling markets has continued. Indeed, there has been considerable   progress since John and I spoke on this topic last year � both here in the UK and the US.     We have not been blind to the disruption to businesses and the challenges for banks in communicating with   clients caused by Covid. In co-operation with the Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates, in the UK we   have worked to change the phasing of some of the key milestones that were put in place for transition at the   start of this year.     Communication and education for those households and businesses exposed to Libor is a huge challenge.   The early focus has rightly been on raising awareness across those in the financial industry that generate   Libor linked exposure that will need to support their clients through transition. Increasingly though, regulators�   and markets� efforts need to turn to much broader communication to ensure the end users of Libor   understand the weaknesses with the rates, why they need to move to alternatives and what the timeline is for   the action they will need to take to prepare for that move.     This remains a difficult balance given the challenges faced by many. We are working to make this process as   accessible and straight forward as possible, cooperating with bodies such as the Association of Corporate   Treasurers and the Confederation of British Industry. And from next month, as previously announced, the   Bank of England will begin publication of a freely available compounded SONIA index to support use of the   rate across a wide range of sterling products.     Avoiding the problem won�t make it smaller or change the need to transition. The answer is for us collectively   to confront the challenge and make the necessary progress over the next 18 months. In September, the   Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates will begin a further program of public communications   to help those with Libor linked exposures navigate onto more robust alternatives.     But well done is better than well said, and from October UK banks should all be offering alternatives to Libor.   Indeed, a number of the largest UK lenders are already doing this. I�d suggest if you are borrowing past the   end of 2021 you consider seriously the greater certainty that those alternatives offer. If you do decide to   borrow linked to Libor then your bank should discuss how that contract will change from Libor to an   alternative rate ahead of the end of 2021. We would not expect to see any further sterling Libor linked   lending after the end of March 2021. Regulated firms in the UK should expect their supervisors to monitor   and discuss their progress with these important milestones.                                                                                                                      6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                             6   The state of play in sterling so far     I�ve highlighted the problems with continuing to rely on Libor, but the positive side of this is the progress that   continues to be made in creating deep and liquid markets in robust alternatives.     In sterling, the chosen alternative is SONIA, produced by the Bank of England. The market for SONIA linked   derivatives is well established. The share of swaps traded using SONIA is broadly equivalent to that linked   to Libor, with continued growth at longer maturities. Volumes in Libor linked options are decreasing and   there are promising signs of a SONIA options market developing; we have also seen growth in SONIA   futures during the first half of 2020.     There is now a fully functioning SONIA linked bond market with 40 Floating Rate Notes issued, totalling over   �16bn so far this year. In total, there has now been issuance of over �185bn of bonds referencing   compounded SONIA. There has also been in excess of �20bn of publicly distributed SONIA linked   securitisations since April 2019. We have seen businesses such as Shell, South West Water, Associated   British Ports, National Express Group and Riverside Group all move borrowing on to near risk-free rates.   March saw the first multi-currency revolving credit facility linked to both SONIA and SOFR. The industry is   making progress on the conventions underlying these products and infrastructure vendors are ensuring their   products can support SONIA linked products.     The beginning of the end     I will now turn to legacy business and what has come to be referred to as the �endgame�.     After extensive consultation by ISDA across markets we will shortly have a robust and trusted fallback for   trillions of dollars of derivative contracts. We encourage early sign-up to the protocol, but that is not a   substitute for continuing to move business onto near risk-free rates. We expect to see more of the sterling   swap market to move towards SONIA in the UK given the high likelihood that contracts will be linked to this   rate after 2021. We are working with the market on fallbacks for cash instruments, looking to ensure hedge   positions convert at the same time as underlying exposures, to minimise the introduction of any new basis   risk.     We have continued to see firms start to convert Libor linked instruments to alternative rates, for example   through consent solicitation processes where over �10bn of legacy Floating Rate Notes, securitisations and   covered bonds have converted to SONIA.     We have been clear and consistent in the importance of transitioning away from Libor and that this transition   should be a market driven, but we have also acknowledged the authorities have an important role to play.   We remain committed about both the need for the market to continue to drive transition forward moving new                                                                                                                   7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                             7   issuance onto alternative rates and converting legacy exposure where possible; and also to ensuring there is   a solution for those contracts that legitimately cannot be converted from Libor.     That is why the UK government announced last month its intention to legislate to provide the FCA with   increased powers to deliver an orderly wind-down of critical benchmarks, such as Libor. 7 It remains in the   interests of financial markets and their customers that the pool of contracts referencing LIBOR is shrunk to   an irreducible minimum ahead of LIBOR�s expected cessation, leaving behind only those contracts that   genuinely have no or inappropriate alternatives and no realistic ability to be renegotiated or amended. Those   that decide to rely on regulatory action, enabled by the legislation the UK Government plans to bring forward,   will not have control over the economic terms of that action. The FCA will consult on what that action may   look like and what the limitations of any solution may be for the �tough legacy�, but it is important to note:         ?    Any solution will only be designed for legacy contracts, it will not be available for new business, so            this not an alternative to moving new activity away from LIBOR as soon as is prudent;         ?    (as the FCA have said), use of the powers will not provide a solution in all circumstances, in            particular if the relevant alternative inputs are not available to the benchmark administrator. Given            the challenges I have already covered in creating a robust dynamic credit spread, the market would            need to be prepared for a fixed proxy based on historical averages; and         ?    neither authorities, nor market participants in ISDA�s consultation, or in bond markets as revealed by            practice, want forward looking term risk-free rates to be the basis of derivative markets. It is very            important, if these tools are to be used without unwanted side effects, to see derivative markets            move away first, either organically, or through the ISDA protocol.     The message remains clear: those who can transition away from LIBOR should do so on terms that they   themselves agree with their counterparties.     Conclusion     Libor transition is challenging. It has been embedded in the financial system for a number of decades across   a broad range of products.     But we are moving away from Libor and the problems of Libor. This means facing up to transition now, taking   action to ensure new issuance moves to robust alternative rates and concrete plans are in place to deal with      7    https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2020-06-   23/HCWS307/                                                                                                                                8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                                       8   legacy exposures. The UK Government announcement on its intention to legislate and the finalisation of the   ISDA protocol are important steps in the �endgame� becoming clearer.     There is more to do and work is underway to remove the remaining barriers to transition. After John has   spoken we�ll be joined by the chairs of the UK and US industry groups who continue to lead this work,   building consensus on key areas such as product conventions and cash fallback mechanisms. Hopefully,   the message is now clear to those who have remained on the side-line: this is a necessity not a choice and   there are eighteen months left to transition.     And, for the avoidance of doubt, I�m taking it that eighteen months in Libor is past the middle of the seventh,   so you don�t need to get up now, stretch and sing �Take Me Out to the Ball Game� before John speaks.                                                                                                                    9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches                                          9"
2020-09-01	"The central bank balance sheet as a policy tool: past, present   and future       Speech given by   Andrew Bailey   Governor of the Bank of England     Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium   28 August 2020       I am grateful to Jonathan Bridges, Richard Harrison, Josh Jones, Aakash Mankodi and Nick McLaren   for their assistance in helping me prepare these remarks.                                                                                                       1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice   Introduction     It�s a great pleasure to be participating in the virtual Jackson Hole conference. Well done to the Kansas City   Fed for keeping up the tradition � albeit we have to imagine the beauty of Jackson Hole is around us.     A tradition of the Jackson Hole conference is to encourage us to look forwards. This time is not only an   opportunity to do just that, but in doing so to apply the lessons of the last few months, as well as the last   decade or so since the financial crisis of 2007-09. I am going to do that through the lens mainly of monetary   policy, but bringing in financial stability where relevant, with a particular focus on central bank balance   sheets. My remarks are a summary of a paper being released today.1 It isn�t a review of the record of   monetary policy or the framework of policy, but it does cover a good deal of recent evidence and experience.   The paper, and my remarks today, focus on the UK case, drawing on lessons from international experience.     Drivers of central bank balance sheets since the Global Financial Crisis     I will start with some brief scene setting points � apologies that they are pretty obvious ones, but they are   important. There has been a large and sustained expansion of most central bank balance sheets in the past   decade. This has come about in support of both monetary policy and financial stability objectives. These   respective drivers of balance sheet growth are closely intertwined � never more so than in the response to   the Covid crisis � but distinguishing the causes and consequences is important nonetheless.     Starting with financial stability, the Global Financial Crisis revealed banks had previously held insufficient   high quality liquid assets, in part due to the inadequacy of the prudential regulation regime at the time.   The changes since then, in regulation and in banks� approach to managing risk, have resulted in a significant   increase in the demand for central bank reserves, a large part of banks� stock of high quality liquid assets.   Thus, the level of reserves required by the banking systems in the major economies is persistently higher,   though it is not straightforward to determine exactly how much higher. That depends on a number of factors   that can change over time.     Second, monetary policy has also undergone a major shift over the past decade, towards using central bank   balance sheets as a tool to provide monetary stimulus, through the purchase of assets, usually government   debt.     These two reasons for increasing the size of central bank balance sheets coincided in time � i.e. the post-   crisis response of regulation coincided with the greater use of quantitative easing. But it is nonetheless   helpful to separate them analytically. A decade ago there would have been reason to think that the monetary   policy need for increased central bank balance sheets would be shorter term, while the financial stability    1    See �The central bank balance sheet as a policy tool: past, present and future�, by Andrew Bailey, Jonathan Bridges, Richard   Harrison, Josh Jones and Aakash Mankodi. Available here.                                                                                                                                   2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                                       2   demand would be permanent. That distinction still stands, but the structural drivers of low equilibrium interest   rates suggest the use of central bank balance sheets for monetary policy will be more long-lived than had   been anticipated.     Expansion of central bank balance sheets in response to Covid     Turning to the more recent period, the financial stability and monetary policy drivers of central bank balance   sheet expansion were again deeply intertwined. Central banks faced an incipient financial stability shock   together with a need for monetary policy to respond to an unprecedented � in scale and speed � economic   downturn.     But the financial stability emergency differed from previous such events. The problem originated not primarily   in the banking system, but in the non-bank sector � among funds, traders and corporates themselves.   Central banks activated their traditional tools to inject liquidity into the banks via repo operations, and these   played an important part in stabilising conditions. But they were not sufficient to get liquidity to non-banks   quickly enough, or in sufficient scale. That also required large and aggressive asset purchase operations,   what we call in the paper �go Big� and �go Fast�. I am not going to say more on this, save that it raises very   important points about market structures, the extent of self-insurance against liquidity shocks by non-banks,   and the nature of central bank interventions. This is the subject of a review currently being undertaken by   the Financial Stability Board.     The Covid crisis called on central banks to act in what has been the first big test of the post financial crisis   world. Monetary policy has had to respond to an unprecedented shock. For many central banks, the main   tool to date has been further Quantitative Easing, in unprecedented scale and pace of purchases. This has   inevitably rekindled questions about exactly how QE works and whether its effectiveness is conditional on   the state of the economy and the financial system � to what extent is its effectiveness state contingent?   Moreover, looking across monetary policy and financial stability, it has re-emphasised the importance of   central bank balance sheets as a direct tool of policy intervention, rather than primarily a passive by-product   of the activity of setting the price of money and meeting the demand for reserves to satisfy the liquidity needs   of the banking system.     So what is our latest thinking on the effects of QE and how it works? Viewed from the depth of the Covid   crisis, QE worked effectively. Measuring this effect precisely is of course hard, since we cannot easily   identify what the counterfactual would have been in the absence of QE. But QE clearly acted to break a   dangerous risk of transmission from severe market stress to the macro-economy, by avoiding a sharp   tightening in financial conditions and thus an increase in effective interest rates.                                                                                                                          3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                          3   QE is normally thought to work through a number of channels: including signalling of future central bank   intentions and thus interest rates; so called �portfolio balance� effects (i.e. by changing the composition of   assets held by the private sector); and improving impaired market liquidity.     The Monetary Policy Committee�s decision on QE in March differed somewhat from previous rounds of   purchases. A larger amount of purchases, �200bn, was announced as this was judged as necessary to   support economic activity and ensure a sustainable return of inflation to target. And the purchases were to   �be completed as soon as is operationally possible� to address the emerging financial market dysfunction.     In the paper we draw two lessons from the experience. First, it reminds us that the effect of QE can be state   contingent. Consistent with that, second, the pace of QE purchases may be more important during a period   of market dysfunction associated with a widespread shock to liquidity demand. Indeed, when the MPC voted   to expand QE further in June, in more normal market conditions, the pace of purchases was reduced.     Standing back from the Covid crisis, and looking at the UK case, there indeed is some evidence that the   impact of QE over the past decade has been largest at times of market dysfunction and illiquidity. Of course   the available event studies are very few in number. But, if this result proves robust, it suggests that �going   big and fast� with QE is particularly effective in these conditions.     I should stress that while the liquidity channel of QE appears to have been particularly relevant in terms of   impact at a time of market dysfunction, such as that observed in March, the different channels of QE impact   are by no means mutually exclusive. It seems likely that each channel operates to at least some extent most   of the time, with all of them affecting long-term interest rates and thus economic activity and inflation.   But this need not suggest that all the channels are equally powerful and persistent in all states of the world.     Implications for the future     What does this mean for central bank balance sheets looking forwards? Again, two points stand out, though I   should emphasise their tentative nature. First, a balance sheet intervention aimed solely at market   functioning is likely to be more temporary, in terms of the duration of its need to be in place. To be clear, the   asset purchases announced by the MPC in March were a response to much more than just market   functioning, in terms of the effects of Covid on the outlook for the economy and inflation. Second, if the   effects of QE are more powerful in crisis states of the world, we may need to ensure that we have enough   headroom in the future to repeat it. The determinants of QE unwind may therefore be more subtle than   previously thought, and the Covid crisis offers a new lens through which to assess its role.     This leads to what may be regarded as the most speculative of the conclusions, but it strikes me as   important as we look to the decade ahead. It follows from the state contingent nature of the effects of QE,   and the argument for going �big and fast� in such situations, that the central bank balance sheet may have                                                                                                                    4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                        4   more of a counter-cyclical role and function than the evidence of the last decade alone would suggest, at   least in certain circumstances. We need to work through what lessons this may have for the appropriate   future path of central bank balance sheets, including the pace and timing of any future unwind of asset   purchases. But one conclusion is that it could be preferable, and consistent with setting monetary conditions   consistent with the inflation target, to seek to ensure there is sufficient headroom for more potent expansion   in central bank balance sheets when needed in the future � to �go big� and �go fast� decisively.     That begs questions about when does the need for headroom become an issue? What are the limits? One   way of looking at these questions is in terms of the stock of assets available for purchase. There is currently   a large outstanding stock of government bonds which could be purchased. And if the state contingent effects   of QE are driven by the need for holders of safe assets to exchange them for deposits, then it must always   be possible for the central bank to purchase more assets. In other words, the central bank would need to   own a high proportion of safe assets for that to become a constraint. But if negative shocks continue to arrive   from time to time before any reversal of the stock of asset purchases takes place, and hence the stock   owned by the central bank continues to rise, the odds of this situation arising go up. This effect may become   more likely if the equilibrium real interest rate remains low for a prolonged period.     Expanding the range of assets purchased is another way for central banks to create more headroom.   The Covid crisis has seen a further broadening of the range of assets that central banks stand ready to   purchase. In part, this has reflected another objective of central banks and governments, given the scale of   the crisis and its economic effects, namely to direct and target funds to the corporate sector, and thus   supplement the more normal role of banks and financial markets. But it also reflected a need to act on a   broad front in terms of ensuring liquidity gets to the places where it is needed. Where that requires larger   purchases of a broader array of assets, it inevitably raises risk management questions for central banks.     So, I think the Covid crisis has demonstrated the need to ensure central banks have as many tools as   possible in their box, of which expanded purchases of private sector assets is one, but given the issues it   raises I would emphasise state contingency here in terms of when some tools may be more appropriate or   necessary, given the severity or particular nature of the circumstances at the time.     The MPC has considered its prospective approach to QE unwind in recent years, and in June 2018 set out   that the balance sheet would be unwound at a gradual and predictable pace, allowing reserves to fall back to   a level demanded by banks through their participation in regular repo operations, and once the Bank Rate   had risen to around 1.5%, thus creating more headroom for the future use of Bank Rate both up and down.   The MPC keeps this approach under review, though I should make clear that it does not seem like an   imminent issue in current conditions. But we are looking at the next decade at this conference, so who   knows what will happen. We should keep the options to use all our tools as open as possible, so I would   conclude that the appropriate policy mix going forwards over a decade may be more nuanced than                                                                                                                    5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                      5   previously thought. Either way, our actions will be guided by our remit of achieving low inflation with financial   stability.     Conclusion     The Covid crisis to date has demonstrated that QE and forward guidance around it have been effective in a   particular situation. It emphasises that we remain in a world where the choice of tool to use is more important   than it has been at times in the past. And there is more nuance and flexibility within tools � thus, while QE   relies more on stock effects when used in normal times, in a case of extreme market dysfunction the flow   effect of the liquidity channel may come to prominence.     The MPC has moved on from that approach as market conditions have eased. In June we increased the   stock of QE purchases, but at a slower pace. And in August we introduced forward guidance, stating that the   Committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy until there is clear evidence that significant progress is   being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably. This important   step is intended to ensure monetary conditions do not tighten prematurely when there are some initial signs   of an economic recovery.     We also made clear that our box does include other tools, including the possibility of negative rates.   We have used private sector asset purchases through the corporate bond programme, longer-term liquidity   provision to banks with targeted lending incentives, and direct purchasing of newly issued commercial paper   to supplement market-based lending channels. We are not out of firepower by any means, and to be honest   it looks from today�s vantage point that we were too cautious about our remaining firepower pre-Covid.   But, hindsight is a wonderful thing when you have it.     In the decade ahead, I think we need to take on board the message the Covid crisis has reiterated, namely   that our tools may be state contingent in their effects. And with that in mind, let�s not ignore the need to   manage central bank balance sheets to enable such state contingency to take effect. There are times when   we need to go big and go fast.

So, the world is always more   uncertain than ever � except that at the moment it really is. And, innovation is all around us except in the   productivity numbers. One area where innovation really is around is the world of payments, the focus of my   remarks today.     Innovation is a good thing. As authorities and regulators it is not in our interest � the broad public interest �   to stop innovation. Moreover, when supported by clear standards and expectations, innovation can support   the pursuit of public interest objectives such as greater inclusivity and network resilience. Making such   standards clear early is much preferred to attempting to claw back the ground later, and particularly if that   comes after things go wrong.     This is the backdrop to innovation in payments, particularly in the area of so-called digital currencies,   developed to offer new forms of �money�.     The way we pay for things is changing rapidly. As people increasingly turn away from transactional use of   cash, which comes after the decline of cheques, innovative alternatives are flourishing. The focus of use of   such innovation has so far more been within domestic markets. The picture of payments going across   borders is less encouraging. It can still take as long as 10 days to transfer money to different jurisdictions   and the transaction cost can sometimes be 10% of the value of the transfer.1     As part of a global G20, Financial Stability Board (FSB), and Committee on Payments and Market   Infrastructures (CPMI) initiative, the recent report on �Enhancing cross-border payments: building blocks of a   global roadmap� clearly sets out the challenges and frictions that exist. 2 These include significant barriers to   entry, long transaction chains with multiple currencies and intermediaries involved, legacy technology, limited   operating hours, and high operating costs from compliance checks and funding requirements.     The CPMI Task Force on Cross Border Payments; involving the Bank of England, other central banks and   standard setting bodies, has led this work, and has set out an ambitious plan for a joint public and private   sector vision; global regulatory, supervisory and oversight coordination; improvement of existing payment   infrastructures; enhancing data quality; and exploring the potential of new innovations.     But, with these benefits comes risks and challenges for authorities. We should treat this as being in the   nature of change. The Bank of England�s Financial Policy Committee has set out principles to respond to the   significant changes in the payments landscape. Payments regulation should reflect the financial stability risk,     1     The Financial Times, 13 July 2020, �Cross-border payment systems have been neglected for too long�.   https://www.ft.com/content/a241d7e0-e1de-4812-b214-b350cbb7d046   2     CPMI, 13 July 2020, �Enhancing cross-border payments: building blocks of a global roadmap�. https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d193.htm                                                                                                                                    2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                                          2   rather than the legal or technological form, of payment activities. Firms that are systemically important   should be subject to standards of operational and financial resilience that reflect the risks they pose, with   sufficient data available to monitor emerging risks. These may sound like common sense points, but   innovation is increasingly challenging regulators� ability to ensure they are met.     Money and Cash     Returning to the theme of central banks and their particular use of language, an important distinction we   often refer to is between central bank and commercial bank money. Literally, this is the distinction between   money which is a direct claim on the balance sheet of a central bank and money that is a claim on the   balance sheet of an authorised and regulated commercial bank to which the local deposit protection rules   apply.     Central bank money takes two forms. Reserve accounts are held by banks and other financial institutions   and provide part of the stock of high quality liquid assets and from that the balances used to effect the   making and settlement of payments between themselves. They are also a crucial part of how central banks   set monetary policy. Cash is the only form of central bank money accessible by the general public.     Another important term to bring in here is fiat money. Fiat money is state-backed money denominated in the   national currency. Cash is a form of fiat money. Commercial bank money is only acceptable for wide scale   use in the UK if it is denominated in sterling, convertible into sterling fiat money at par, and convertible on   demand. Private providers of commercial money need to demonstrate they can meet these obligations so   that individuals and business can have confidence in being able to regard different types of money as   indistinguishable from cash, and be able to change it 1-for-1 on demand.     Until recently in the UK, cash accounted for the largest number of payments (by number not value). 3 But in   the UK the use of cash in transactions was declining before the Covid pandemic. With the impact of Covid   and the UK lockdown, cash withdrawal volumes have dropped further. At their lowest during the UK   lockdown, cash withdrawals were 60% lower in April 2020 than a year before. Even as the UK lockdown has   eased, cash withdrawal volumes have remained low - in July they were around 40% lower than the year   before.4 The increased use of non-cash payments places even greater importance on payments systems,   which underlies the work the Bank is doing to upgrade RTGS.     But, there is an increasing paradox in the area of cash. I can speak from personal experience on this as a   former Chief Cashier of the Bank of England. When I became Chief Cashier at the start of 2004 the value of   notes in circulation (NIC) was �34bn. When I moved on in March 2011 it was �49bn. Today it stands at      3       UK Finance, June 2020, �UK Payment Markets 2020�.   4       LINK, July 2020, Monthly Report. https://www.link.co.uk/media/1634/monthly-report-july-2020-final.pdf                                                                                                                     3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                         3   �77bn. It took 310 years to get to �34bn and then just over 16 years to move on to �77bn, and it has not   fallen.5     The paradox of cash is obvious: use in payments is declining but the value of the stock in issue is not. For   the sake of brevity, I�m not going to discuss the possible explanations of the paradox here.     Meanwhile, innovation in payments picks up pace.     Traditionally, outside the use of cash, payments have been made in commercial bank money using systems   that settle in central bank money across the reserve accounts held by banks. Central banks have   increasingly brought these systems under regulatory oversight with the intention of ensuring appropriate   legal finality of settlement and operational resilience.     More recently, innovation has started to strain at this framework in a number of ways. I will set out three   forms that this innovation takes, and why it raises questions.     I will start with crypto-assets, such as bitcoin, which have appeared in the last ten years or so. They have no   connection at all to money. They may have extrinsic value � you may like to collect them for instance, and   as such they are a highly risky investment opportunity. Their value can fluctuate quite wildly, unsurprisingly.   They strike me as unsuited to the world of payments, where certainty of value matters.     The next innovation is alternative payments such as e-money, which in Europe has grown under the   auspices of the Second Electronic Money Directive (EMD2) and the Second Payment Services Directive   (PSD2). To be clear, this has been translated into the UK as part of the on-shoring of EU law in the context   of Brexit. This regime creates something which is more money-like in the sense of commercial bank money,   but doesn�t have the same direct link to fiat money, and the safeguarding regime does not have all the   features of deposit protection. It is therefore a hybrid. We must ensure that users fully understand the   difference in protection, and I suspect at the moment that is not widely the case. The standards are less   developed than those for banks, there is no depositor protection scheme, and firms are subject to only   limited capital and liquidity requirements. Finally, there is no resolution or administration regime. This   means that if firm failed, holders of its �money� would be forced to pursue any recovery through a corporate   insolvency procedure, which would neither be quick nor guarantee their funds back.     The third innovation, and the one on which I will focus more, is so-called stablecoins.     Where many earlier forms of crypto-assets, such as bitcoin, have proved unsuitable for widespread use in   payments, stablecoins, and particularly global stablecoins, aim to do just that. Not all stablecoins are    5    Bank of England data. These figures exclude Giants and Titans (i.e. higher value notes used as cover for the note issues of banks in   Scotland and Northern Ireland).                                                                                                                                       4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                                           4   intended for use in making payments. Some stablecoin proposals may be used to facilitate investments.   However, where a stablecoin is used to facilitate the transfer of �money� for buying goods and services and   the settling of debts, then it may become widely used a means of payment and store of value.     Global stablecoins seek to apply new technology, stemming from the world of crypto-assets, as well as   changing some of the fundamentals of the underlying payment chain. They change not only how you pay but   what you pay with � rather than a transfer of money between bank accounts, stablecoin systems transfer the   asset itself � the stablecoin � from one person to another.     Stablecoins could offer some useful benefits. For example, they could further reduce frictions in payments,   by potentially increasing the speed and lowering the cost of payments (particularly if global stablecoins were   to be established). Stablecoins may offer increased convenience, including via integration with other   technology, such as social media platforms or retail services.     If stablecoins are to be widely used as a means of payment, they must have equivalent standards to those   that are in place today for other forms of payment types and the forms of money transferred through them.   This will ensure that they are safe and resilient and that consumers can use them with confidence.     To reiterate, a key principle for payments is that users can be confident that the instrument they use to   transfer value can be converted into fiat money at any time. And, in the rare circumstances that the entity   that issued that instrument fails, that there are clear rules and protections for the payment recipient and for   the consumer. It is this assurance that stabilises the value of the transfer asset so that all parties in the   economy can rely on it. Banks achieve this by giving the customer a money claim at par, supported by   banks� access to central bank facilities and extensive regulation of banks� activities, including a protection   scheme for customer deposits up to a certain amount. It is these protections that mean that individual shop   owners don�t worry about scrutinising which bank issued your debit card before you tap it to pay. It is these   protections that prevent a return to the literal wild-west in which individual banks issued their own private   currencies, which were worth different amounts depending on recipient�s assessment of the soundness of   the issuing bank.     What is not acceptable is to fall between regimes � for instance to argue that by holding backing assets such   as sovereign bonds that are in general much safer than those on a bank�s balance sheet, this is good   enough to ensure convertibility into fiat money at par. Low risk is not the same as no risk. This is why the   FPC set out in its Financial Stability Report that stablecoins used in systemic payment chains should meet   the standards equivalent to those expected of commercial bank money in relation to stability of value,   robustness of legal claim and the ability to redeem at par in fiat.                                                                                                                        5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                        5   Some major stablecoin proposals do not appear at present to meet this expectation     Some stablecoin proposals do not include a legal claim for coin-holders. And some stablecoins propose   backing in instruments that may have material market, credit and liquidity risk, but do not have the money   protections I have outlined. While this might be acceptable for speculative investment purposes, it would not   be for payments widely relied upon by households and businesses. Stablecoins need to offer coin-holders a   robust claim, with supporting mechanisms and protections to ensure they can be redeemed at any time   1-to-1 into fiat currency.     Some may ask if this would rule out a multi-currency stablecoin? Such a proposition is the wrong place to   start � it raises questions around the value of the coin, and the underlying money it represents. The starting   point for a global stablecoin should be based on single currencies. We should not run before we can walk.     Setting standards early on     We must therefore set standards early on so that innovation can take place with confidence on what will be   required. This gives certainty not only to regulators and users but also to innovators. Indeed, the   international community has agreed that �no global stablecoin project should begin operation until the legal,   regulatory and oversight challenges and risks� are adequately addressed, through appropriate designs and   by adhering to regulation that is clear and proportionate to the risks.�6     However given the novel form, existing standards do not necessarily easily apply. There need to be   minimum international standards for stablecoins. In addition any stablecoin with potential for wide scale use   in the UK must meet our domestic expectations.     A stablecoin which intends to launch with sterling-based activities in the UK should first meet relevant   standards and be appropriately regulated. And if a sterling retail stablecoin wishes to operate at scale in the   UK, then we will strongly consider the need for an entity to be incorporated in the UK. This is similar to the   subsidiarisation of banks that we require if they are holding UK retail transactional customer deposits above   a de minimis level.7     But a global stablecoin is a cross-border phenomenon. It can be operated in one jurisdiction, denominated   in another�s currency and used by consumers in a third. The regulatory response must match this. As in    6     G7 Working Group on Stablecoins, October 2019, �Investigating the impact of global stablecoins�.   https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d187.pdf   7     The PRA may require subsidiarisation where firms have material retail banking operations. In making that judgement, the PRA takes   account of the value and type of retail deposits and the extent to which they are covered by the FSCS. We expect branches to have   under �100m of retail deposits, and also take account of the number of depositors and the number of retail and small-company   customers with transactional accounts. See: SS1/18, �International banks: the Prudential Regulation Authority�s approach to branch   authorisation and supervision�.https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/prudential-regulation/supervisory-   statement/2018/ss118                                                                                                                                       6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                                         6   banking and traditional payment systems, the regulatory response must be grounded in internationally-   agreed standards. Global issues require a global response, particularly for multi-currency stablecoins   intended for cross-border transactions.     Along with the G7, the Financial Stability Board has been leading co-ordination of the international response   to global stablecoins. The FSB consulted in April on the regulatory and supervisory challenges they present,   with a final report due in October, and the Bank of England supports the efforts to set a baseline set of   expectations. These include that stablecoins should be regulated based on the functions they perform and   risks they create, and that there should be comprehensive domestic and international regulation and   supervision. Global stablecoins should have robust governance and risk management, and be transparent   about their stability mechanisms and coin-holders� rights.     This baseline set of expectations will help avoid regulatory fragmentation and is an important and necessary   step. But alone it is not sufficient. Existing standards must be examined and updated where necessary.   There needs to be a clear G20 mandate for the various sectoral standard-setting bodies to consider their   standards and whether they need to be refreshed or clarified in light of stablecoins. This is necessary to truly   deliver on the principle of same risk - same regulation. The Committee on Payments and Market   Infrastructure (CPMI) and International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) are working to   ensure that it is clear to stablecoin developers how international standards of regulation and supervision for   financial market infrastructures, including payment systems, (the Principles for Financial Market   Infrastructures � PFMI) will apply to them, including where stablecoins are used in systemic payment   systems. Other standards setters, such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Basel Committee   on Banking Supervision (BCBS), will need to respond as well.     Coordination between regulators is essential too. In particular, host regulators of global stablecoins must,   and are, working with other regulators in other jurisdictions to ensure that they are appropriately regulated   and gaps in coverage, opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, do not emerge.     The Bank looks forward to the conclusions of the FSB�s consultation, and the subsequent finalising of   international work, to ensure a comprehensive framework can be in place. Current proposed global   stablecoin offerings will need to demonstrate how they meet these key domestic and international standards.   They must do so before the global regulatory community can be comfortable with their launch and   widespread adoption.     Central Bank Digital Currency     A very reasonable and important question is whether a better outcome would be for central banks   themselves to harness much of the technological and IT systems innovation and directly digitise cash? A   Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) would be an electronic form of central bank money that could be used                                                                                                                   7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                       7   by households and businesses to make payments. Digital central bank money would surely address the   decline in the use of paper money without the complications of creating the protections required around   stablecoins? Yes and no is I suspect the answer. The question is a good one and should be considered   (and is being so) but the answer is not in yet. It�s a very big question.     Offering a CBDC would allow broad access to central bank money in a digital form. But any launch of a   CBDC requires careful prior consideration to fully explore all the issues and implications in order to make an   informed decision, including ascertaining that there would be demand for such a thing.     CBDC, whilst offering much potential, also raises profound questions about the shape of the financial system   and the implications for monetary and financial stability and the role of the central bank. There are   fundamental questions in play. What might a CBDC mean for monetary policy transmission � would it bring   new tools and fuller, faster transmission of policy choices? To what extent would a CBDC �disintermediate�   the banking sector, and what impact would this have on the cost and availability of credit, and the resilience   of banking business models and funding? And what services and infrastructure should a central bank offer   as part of a CBDC and what might best be left to the private sector?     The paper from Brookings in July on �Design Choices for CBDC� helpfully explored a number of these issues,   as well as key technological points on the need for interoperability and connectivity between and among   central and commercial bank systems for CBDC to function effectively. 8 Such standards are even more   important in a world where there might be a need for interoperability and friction-free movement between   CBDC, private stablecoins and other payment mechanisms. We, along with international counterparts are   considering these closely.     The Bank of England is exploring these issues and published its Discussion Paper on CBDC earlier this   year,9 setting out key considerations and an illustrative model based on a central bank core ledger and   private payment interface providers offering overlay services to users. The paper received a wide range of   responses. We are currently working through the responses, continuing to engage with stakeholders and   look forward to setting out more information next year. We are also working closely with our international   counterparts who are facing the same questions.     Stablecoins and CBDC are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Depending on design choices, they could sit   alongside each other, either as distinct payment options, or with elements of the stablecoin ecosystem, such   as wallets, providing consumers with access to a CBDC. So there will likely be a role for the private and   public sector working together in the future of payments.      8     Brookings, July 2020, �Design Choices for Central Bank Digital Currency � Policy and technical considerations�.   https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Design-Choices-for-CBDC_Final-for-web.pdf   9     Bank of England, 12 March 2020, �Central Bank Digital Currency: opportunities, challenges and design�.   https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2020/central-bank-digital-currency-opportunities-challenges-and-design-discussion-paper                                                                                                                                   8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                                       8   As well as not being exclusive, stablecoins and CBDC are not the only ways to meet changing demands and   reducing frictions in payments. We need to continue to enhance existing infrastructure, including by renewal   and harmonisation of RTGS systems. This work will continue in parallel with other developments. There are   also initiatives like the UK�s New Payments Architecture, which offers a consolidated and open retail   payment infrastructure.     Public policy questions raised by digital currencies     The rise of stablecoins and the emerging proposition of CBDCs pose fundamental questions about the role   and responsibilities of private firms and central banks in the world of payments. I have outlined the key role   of authorities in ensuring the stability of money, through issuing and ensuring confidence in central bank   money (from monetary policy through to making it hard to counterfeit), and regulating banks to ensure   commercial bank money is stable and convertible on demand. Oversight of payment systems transferring   this money ensures they are resilient and can be used with confidence.     But the changing nature of money causes us to pause and consider the importance and implications of   money which extend much further than a simple exchange of value or financial transaction, and the policy   implications are much greater than the specific mission of a central bank. In short, money has social, and   not just financial functions.     Who should be responsible for the integrity and security of the digital payments architecture? Digital   currencies will create not just a novel form of money, but also a new payment infrastructure, which while   likely bringing benefits to payment efficiency, raises questions around transparency and how resilience and   consumer protection will be ensured. Central banks might be involved in this infrastructure too, but where   might the role of the central bank start, and stop?     Privacy and data protection issues are also a key question. Digital currencies, depending on their design,   could provide considerable information on how people spend their money, and we cannot compromise on   the protection of our privacy. Private firms might seek to use these data, with appropriate user consent, to   offer improved services, but we�ve seen widespread mis-use of data in the past. Digital payments could   entail greater data on users� identities and transactions being centrally visible. The data generated could   have huge opportunities for the detection and prevention of financial crime, but this must be balanced with   the risk of surveillance into private financial matters.     These questions, as well as issues of encouraging inclusion and promoting competition, are not ones for   central banks and regulators alone to answer. They go the heart of how we use money and who should be   responsible for safety and security. There needs to be a wider debate between policy makers, governments   and society as a whole.                                                                                                                    9     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                      9   Conclusion     We have reached the point in the cycle of innovation in payments where it is essential that we set the   standards and thus the expectations for how innovation will take effect. It should not happen the other way   round, with the standard setting playing catch up. The answer is not to strangle innovation, and it does   therefore require a strong dialogue between the parties, which I think we have. It also requires the sort of   thoughtful input that Brookings scholars have made.     If I can end with one overarching point, I think the public expects its payments to carry the assurance of   value that comes with money. At this point, my mother would have said firmly to me, �Thank you for that   statement of the blindingly obvious�. To which I would say, �I look at the debate going on and it isn�t so   obvious any more, but it should be.�     Thank you                                                                                                                      10     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                       10"
2020-11-09	The time to push ahead on tackling climate change   Speech given by   Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England     Corporation of London Green Horizon Summit, Mansion House   9 November 2020                                                                                                       1     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice   It is a great pleasure at least to have the opportunity to meet virtually. Today, I want to focus on how we   ensure that we get back to the vital subject of tackling climate change and the role of the financial system.     First, I want to say what a pleasure it is to be sharing a platform today � so to speak � with Mark Carney. As   I have told Mark quite a few times, timing is everything, and midnight on March 15th was an interesting choice   of date to hand over as Governor. But let me also say that in everything that has happened since at the   Bank we have benefitted from the many things that Mark did during his term, and for that we owe him great   thanks. Mark has gone on to push forward his deep commitment to tackling climate change, and the role of   the financial system in doing that.     There have been times since March when we have faced very stark decisions in the face of the Covid crisis.   We decided in the spring to prioritise preserving people�s jobs and livelihoods in this emergency, and as far   as possible the businesses that provide employment and the life blood of the economy. These short-term   interventions did not discriminate on the basis of climate change. I believe that was the right response. In   the face of such an emergency in all conscience it was not right to say to people that they would be denied a   livelihood because their employment was of the wrong sort for the climate. I say this very starkly, because   there is no point hiding from reality.     But that does not mean that we have abandoned our commitment to tackle climate change and indeed the   UK government has made a firm commitment to transitioning the economy to net zero by 2050. If we   needed reminding of the importance for the UK and the 125 other countries who have made similar   commitments of delivering on them, this year we have seen record wildfires in Australia and California,   record-breaking temperatures in the Arctic Circle and of course the powerful witness of Sir David   Attenborough. These are a striking reminder of the need for sustained action by government, public   authorities and the private sector. And it is important that, even in the face of the resurgence of Covid and   the necessary measures to tackle it, we plan for the future and act on these plans.     We all know an economy-wide transition to net zero is a huge task. But our experience with Covid has   powerfully demonstrated our ability to adapt which should give us all comfort that the task we face should be   achievable.     And to illustrate the importance of getting that focus back, let me draw on a parallel from history. One of the   most fundamental reforms � if not the most � of the international financial system was the Bretton Woods   Agreement of 1944. Wisely, our predecessors did not wait for the Second World War to end to determine   what the future should look like, and thereby tackle problems that had beset the inter-war period. There are   two strong messages from Bretton Woods that we should have at the front of our minds. Don�t wait for   today�s problem to be over before setting the course for the future. And, once again we need a multilateral   approach, and we have the opportunity to strengthen that multilateralism. But, if you read the history of   Bretton Woods, you learn that the Agreement was not easy to reach and there were costs attached to it,                                                                                                                   2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                       2   which had to be met. It laid the platform for a sustained recovery from a terrible crisis. There is a lesson in   that story.     So what are we as a central bank and regulator of the world�s leading global financial centre doing to ensure   the financial system plays it part to tackle climate change?     Our goal is to build a UK financial system resilient to the risks from climate change and supportive of the   transition to a net-zero economy. In the aftermath of the financial crisis we took far-reaching action to make   the financial system more resilient against crises � Covid is the first real test of those changes. The financial   system has supported the real economy in the crisis, as it must. We need that same ambition in our   approach to climate change. But what is different with climate change is that we know now it is coming, so   we can identify where risks will arise and start managing them in advance. Compared to the financial crisis   and the pandemic, the risks from climate change are even bigger and more complex to manage. And acting   now gives us the best opportunity to manage those risks.     The good news is that progress is being made. A mere five years ago climate change was considered more   of a charitable cause within the financial sector.     Although it can sound prosaic, this progress has to focus on data and disclosure. The Taskforce for   Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) has led the way on this. What we cannot measure we cannot   manage, so it is important that financial firms and their clients use the TCFD framework and the latest tools   available to measure, model and disclose the climate risks and opportunities they are exposed to today and   in different future climate scenarios. We at the Bank started to do this ourselves when we published our own   climate disclosure this summer.1 We are now working with the Treasury and other regulators to consider the   UK�s approach to climate disclosure. Disclosure metrics force us to confront the question of where we are   and where we want to be, and thereby drive different decisions today. Knowing that we will be publishing   our next TCFD disclosure in less than 12 months creates discipline and urgency.     That brings me to the management of climate risks. Last year we became the first central bank and   supervisor to set out supervisory expectations for banks and insurers on the management of climate risks.2   And this year we wrote to CEOs with more guidance, putting in place a deadline for firms to meet our   expectations by the end of 2021.3 Of course, this is no easy task. That is why we have worked closely with   industry through the Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF) to publish a practical guide for firms so that they   can implement changes.4      1     https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2020/climate-related-financial-disclosure-2019-20   2     https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2019/enhancing-banks-and-insurers-approaches-to-managing-the-   financial-risks-from-climate-change-ss   3     https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/letter/2020/managing-the-financial-risks-from-climate-change   4     https://www.fca.org.uk/transparency/climate-financial-risk-forum                                                                                                                                  3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                                       3   As a central bank we are not only concerned with resilience at a micro-level, but also at a macro-level. That   is why in July 2019 we announced our plan to launch a climate stress test exercise.5 When the pandemic   hit, we decided to postpone the exercise in light of strain on firms� resources, and to ensure the ambitious   scope of the exercise could be maintained. We have used the extra time to continue our work on the design   of the exercise, and firms have been busy preparing for it. And today I am pleased to announce a launch   date, June 2021.     The exercise will explore three different climate scenarios, testing different combinations of physical and   transition risks over a 30-year period. We expect to use the exercise as a tool to size the risks faced in these   scenarios, to understand how different bank and insurance business models will be affected and how they   might respond, and finally as a way of improving firms� risk management practices through the process of   carrying out the exercise. We set out our proposed approach to this exercise in a discussion paper at the   end of last year. Building on feedback we received in response to that paper, ahead of the launch, we will   share with participants more detail on some key aspects of the exercise � for example around data   requirements and scenario variables. This active engagement with participants, which we will map out this   week, will help build their assessment capabilities and prepare for the exercise.     We will not use the results to size firms� capital buffers. But that does not mean firms should not be thinking   about near-term capital requirements. As we have set out in our supervisory expectations, firms must   assess how climate risks could impact their business and review whether additional capital needs to be held   against this. Investments that look safe on a backward look may be existentially risky given climate   risks. And investments that might have looked speculative in the past could look much safer in the context of   a transition to net zero. Uncertainty and lack of data is not an excuse. We expect firms to make reasonable   judgements rather than default to �zero�. UK banks and insurers must work to develop these capital   assessments over the coming year and the Bank will be working in tandem to develop its approach to   reviewing them.     There is at least one further role for the financial system to facilitate investment in the economy to support   climate change. It is important to put this into a broader context. The level of investment in the UK economy   as a whole has been weak for some time, and alongside this we have seen weak productivity growth. Covid   has further hit investment, including the investment intentions of firms. An important part of the recovery   from Covid will be to stimulate and support investment, particularly if we do see some elements of structural   change in the economy reflecting, for instance, the way we work. Investing to support the transition to zero   net emissions will be a critical part of the recovery.     Capital markets will therefore need to play an important part in the transition to a resilient carbon-neutral   economy. To support this, we need to see a strong focus on public metrics that set out the climate impacts    5    Climate BES was first announced in the July 2019 Financial Stability Report and further detailed provided in the December 2019   Discussion Paper                                                                                                                                     4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                                         4   of both investment and corporate activities. In turn, this will help to facilitate the development of capital   market instruments that package risk and return and asset allocation strategies that align portfolios with the   transition. The Bank will support the work to make this happen, consistent with the objective of our Financial   Policy Committee to support productive finance and thus the economy.     Returning to Bretton Woods for a moment. The UK economy and financial system is very open, and like   Covid, climate is a common global risk and we cannot hope to insulate ourselves through domestic action   alone. We are committed to working closely with willing international partners through initiatives such as the   Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), of which we are a co-founder and very active member,   and where much progress has been made in raising our collective ambition as central banks and regulators   as well as identifying best practice in identifying and mitigating climate risks in the financial system.     We would like to see greater ambition still, including wider adoption of these best practices, and that will be a   focus for us when the UK takes over the G7 presidency and works closely with the Italian G20 and together   we co-host the COP26 next year.     Thank you.                                                                                                                       5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                       5
2020-11-18	"Andrew Bailey: The future for business investment in the age of Covid and the role of financial services Speech by Mr Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, at TheCityUK National Conference, virtual event, 17 November 2020.                                               * * * Introduction Thank you for inviting me to participate in TheCityUK National Conference. I want to emphasise the importance of the role of TheCityUK and the relationship with the Bank of England. This year, perhaps more than ever, we have drawn on the relationship to exchange views at times of great stress and challenge for the country as a whole. Let me start if you don�t mind with an anecdote which may provide some light relief in these times. Twenty-odd years ago, I was the Governor�s Private Secretary. At the time, there was a need to preserve and revive one of TheCityUK�s predecessors, British Invisibles. The Governor of the day, Eddie George, was involved, and asked Douglas Hurd, previously Foreign Secretary, to conduct a review. The Governor decided to visit Douglas Hurd at his office, in NatWest in Bishopsgate, to discuss the review. We drove there � it�s not far I know. We pulled up outside a NatWest in heavy traffic. The Governor was on the kerbside, his private secretary was not and had to get out and avoid being run over. The Governor was into the NatWest first. Unfortunately, it was the wrong NatWest � it was a branch. I got into the branch to hear the Governor announce to a cashier that he was the Governor of the Bank of England and he had come to see Douglas Hurd. She gave him a look and said: �You�re winding me up mate�. We retreated. Fortunately, we found Douglas Hurd, the review was done, and the lineage can be traced to TheCityUK today. The future for business investment Onto the serious stuff � I want to talk about the future for business investment in the age of Covid and the role of financial services. A bit of recent history to start with: since the global financial crisis, business investment in the UK has been weaker than in previous expansions, and investment growth has been unusually weak relative to employment. It�s the story of weak productivity growth. Globally, there is a well-established story of an excess supply of saving relative to investment opportunity, which underpins the pretty much consensus view that so-called neutral interest rates � the equilibrium rate � will stay low for the foreseeable future. But, let�s stop for a moment on the issue of lack of investment opportunity. There are several strands to this story. I am going to touch on one that is certainly relevant to the UK situation. Economic theory indicates that heightened uncertainty about the future tends to have a negative effect on investment, it increases the attraction of waiting to see how the uncertainty is resolved. Both Covid and the process of setting the future relationship with the EU have increased uncertainty � we see this in surveys � and this has restrained investment. Now, I say this to be clear not in the sense of passing any judgement on Brexit � as a public official I take no position on that, and nor do I pass any judgement on the handling of Covid � that is not the point. Our job at the Bank of England is to call it as we see it. So, yes, uncertainty does reduce investment. As we said in our recent Monetary Policy Report, business expectations for sales next year remain subdued as do measures of investment intentions. Since we published our report, we have had encouraging news on the vaccine front. Of course there is a lot to do, and important steps to take and evidence to gather, but this is a big step forward, and it will play a major role in lowering the level of uncertainty. So let me thank those in                                                  1/3                           BIS central bankers' speeches businesses, universities, government and the NHS who are pushing this vital work forward at such impressive speed. If we can now see some light at the end of the tunnel, we need to focus more on important questions about how our economies will look in the future, how we want them to look, what will be the legacy of Covid, and what we can do to support and prioritise any necessary more structural changes. Economics can be a dismal affair as we know, and as befits that, we tend to talk in unfortunate terms about �scarring� to the economy. We tried to refocus that approach a bit in our recent Monetary Policy Report, and instead look at how the structure of the economy may change in the future. We described it in terms of three potential components of the change: how what we buy has changed and the way we buy it; how the way we work has changed; and how what we make may need to change.1 If these changes persist, they could require a reallocation of labour and capital, and this reallocation could be more or less costly. Now, none of us have good answers yet to how much these changes will persist, or even increase. But my best guess is that there will be lasting changes � and we can draw on evidence from history to support this view. I will add two further views, one is that we may see a reversal of the period of low productivity growth. Covid may be the spur � the change agent if you like.2 Second, we must now focus and push ahead hard with the changes necessary to support changing the direction of our climate. All of this will require investment on a much larger scale than we have seen in recent years, and that investment will need to be financed. Before I go on to the issue of financing, I want to elaborate a bit on the issue of scarring. I�m not a pessimist on the likely degree or consequences of structural change. I am not a believer in an overly literal read from history. We saw deep and painful structural change in the economy in the 1980s and into the 1990s, with a transition from heavy industry and mining to a more services oriented economy. That was a much more painful process, with very difficult consequences, including a sharp increase in economic inequality.I don�t believe that Covid will lead to the sort of inter-sectoral change that we saw in the 1980s and 90s. It is more likely to be a case of intra- sectoral change, for instance within services. Such a disruption can, of course, increase the mismatch of employment between firms and occupations, but we have a labour market that has shown the capacity to adjust relatively quickly to such changes. Intra-sectoral change may also increase the likelihood that more capital can be redeployed, and more rapidly. But the prevailing level of uncertainty means there is no cause to be complacent here � and you should expect a central bank to remain cautious. The supply of finance for productive investment Let me turn now to the financing of investment. As I said earlier, we live in a time where there appears to be no shortage of aggregate saving, but investment is weak. Indeed, the aggregate saving rate in the UK has gone up markedly this year as the opportunity to spend has fallen but incomes have, on average, been supported, though we are far from certain to what extent this higher saving level will persist. There is also a role for monetary policy here. As well as maintaining interest rates which are consistent with achieving the inflation target, in my view Quantitative Easing at a time like this can prevent an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions, such as the tightening we observed in late March this year. To be clear, that is not monetary financing or fiscal dominance. It is instead the support of private finance, via a well- functioning financial system, for the economy and thus for consumption and investment. Investment has to be financed. Covid has been a major shock to companies. In our August Financial Stability Report the Bank�s Financial Policy Committee assessed that UK companies could face a cash flow deficit in the current financial year of up to around �200bn as well as                                                   2/3                           BIS central bankers' speeches having to potentially refinance around �275bn of debt maturing over the coming year. It�s not all dismal news though. Since the onset of the Covid shock, UK companies have raised a large amount of external finance, providing them with liquidity to help bridge the disruption. The UK financial system is playing a key role in helping companies manage the impact of the shock. A decade or more on, the financial system is supporting the economy, not the other way around, and that is how it should be. This has been possible due to the resilience that was built up following the global financial crisis, and the extraordinary policy response of the Government, and if you don�t mind me saying so, the Bank of England. But that is not the end of the story. More financing will be needed to ensure viable businesses survive, and to finance the need for investment. And, we need to ensure that this is done without excessive leverage. While the current low level of interest rates supports the sustainability of UK corporate debt, higher leverage would make the corporate sector more vulnerable to interest rate or earnings shocks. So, what are we doing about this? At the Bank, we are emphasising work on the supply of finance for productive investment, which is important for long-term growth and for financial stability. In 2016 the Treasury included in the FPC�s annual remit letter that it should consider, subject to meeting its primary objectives in relation to financial stability, how the UK financial system might best be able to intermediate the supply of finance for productive investment. This year, the Treasury recommended that the FPC consider how financial regulation and changes to the financial system�s structure may have affected the balance between financial stability and the support of productive finance in all regions and nations of the UK. This is very welcome, and I can assure you that we are on the case. We set out our current work in the August Financial Stability Report � with a focus on why DC pension funds in the UK invest only a small proportion of their assets in less liquid investments; reviewing whether aspects of our prudential regulatory framework create disincentives to investing in longer-term and less liquid investments and could be removed without reducing the safety and soundness of banks and insurers, or policyholder protection; and how investment fund structures can safely support necessary investment in certain illiquid assets. To conclude, this agenda is crucial and will have our strong focus. It marries the modern functions of the Bank with some of its best traditions. But, of course, it requires major commitment from the financial services industry, to support the economy, businesses and the people of this country as we get back on our feet from the effects of Covid and transform the economy to support climate change. Fortunately, I know from many conversations that TheCityUK are up for the challenge. Thank you12  1 You do not need to appeal to permanent structural change to be worried about scarring. Even if there were no   change to the structure of the economy, you can still get persistent damage from uncertainty / unemployment /   capital scrapping. 2 Whilst COVID might open up the possibilities of new business models, products and ways of working, more   productivity growth doesn�t come out of nothing. It needs physical investment and, increasingly, investment in   �intangible� capital, such as software, data, R&D, training and new business processes.                                                          3/3                               BIS central bankers' speeches"
2021-02-05	"Andrew Bailey: Modern challenges for the modern central bank - perspectives from the Bank of England Speech by Mr Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, at the LSE German Symposium, virtual event, 5 February 2020.                                                * * * It is a great pleasure to participate in the LSE German Symposium, and congratulations to the organisers for such an interesting programme. I want to take the opportunity today to step back a little and offer some thoughts on the context and framework of monetary policy. It is fast approaching twenty five years since the UK decisively changed its monetary policy framework and embraced the idea of an independent central bank with a mandate to maintain price stability in the form of an inflation target. Now, 25 years may not seem long in the broad sweep of history, but the history of UK monetary regimes points to a quarter of a century representing a relatively long-established one. Long may it last, because it has been successful, and it has delivered the much desired price stability. But the context in which policy is made does not stand still. The first decade of the MPC was with hindsight very benign � the impact of demand shocks to the economy was small, and supply shocks were typically in a favourable direction. The next decade and more has been quite different, with much larger shocks � a mix of both demand shocks and more adverse supply shocks. This period has included a global financial crisis, a global pandemic, and in the UK the decision to leave the European Union. Monetary policy has had to adapt to this world of larger shocks, in an environment where the trend to sustained lower equilibrium interest rates around the world has made the so-called effective lower bound a very pertinent issue. As a first observation, therefore, the task of monetary policy has moved from being a choice (albeit not an easy one) on a single dimension (the official interest rate) to a more multi-dimensional choice which also involves decisions on which tools to use, and which tools to develop � have �in the box� � for possible future use should the need arise. There are important issues of substance here. Close to the lower bound, the transmission of policy tends to be less effective � not redundant or worthless, but nonetheless less effective. But this does not make monetary policy pointless or unnecessary. There are also important challenges to signalling that follow from this greater element of multi- dimensionality of decisions. So-called toolbox decisions should not contain signals on preferences for the actual setting of policy. In other words, central banks should develop and maintain a broad range of tools and seek to communicate this in a manner which avoids being interpreted as a signal on immediate or future preferences on policy setting. A second observation is that over this nearly twenty five year period, the challenge for monetary policy in many countries has shifted from one of getting inflation down to target, to one of getting it up to target. This has been less marked for the UK, in part because in a more open economy movements in the exchange rate have tended to raise inflation during this period. However we are facing a period of below target inflation today. And this is very different to the challenge of the early days of the MPC. It is important to emphasise that the UK regime of inflation targeting is a symmetrical one, and with very good reason. Both high and low inflation are costly. Put like this, the story is pretty obvious and uncontroversial. An independent central bank with a symmetric inflation target has the same objective either way, whether inflation is above or below target � it cannot throw the towel in. To do so would amount to abandoning our remit and our independence.                                                    1/3                           BIS central bankers' speeches But that is not the end of the story because of late it has been said that central bank independence has been compromised by the actions taken in the face of the pandemic. What this really comes down to is the relationship between monetary and fiscal policy, between the economic policy of the Government and the actions of the central bank. Both monetary and fiscal policy are inherently counter-cyclical, and arguably never more so than when we face a shock of the scale of a global pandemic. But at the core of the argument for central bank independence is the evidence from the past that without an independent institution operating monetary policy the overall effects of economic policy were dangerously pro-cyclical at times, leading to bad outcomes. In the face of what may be the deepest recession since 1709, with a collapse of economic activity alongside very low inflation, the question we ask ourselves is what should an inflation targeting central bank do in this situation? The lessons of history don�t change. The answer is to respect our remit and our target, no good will come of ignoring that. The logic of counter-cyclical policy is that all the tools should be applied to raise activity and support employment and the welfare of the public, all of which is consistent with an inflation targeting monetary policy. In practice, doing so has meant using tools to keep financial conditions sufficiently accommodative to offset as best we can such a large shock. This has been essential to support the flow of credit to businesses, which has been very substantial, and has called on both the monetary policy and financial stability tools of the Bank of England. This has also helped to lessen any longer term economic damage from the pandemic, resulting from longer term unemployment and business failures. Fiscal policy, too, has played a very big part, helping to spread the cost of this large shock over time, because otherwise the cost to the public and the country would be unbearable. When I step back from all of this, I think the strong logic is that we are using the tools of counter-cyclical policy, consistent with the remit in the Bank�s case, to support the economy as best as possible through this unprecedented shock. But I sometimes hear that the Bank has flouted the rules and thereby damaged its independence, by purchasing government debt and lowering the government�s cost of borrowing. In many ways, I am glad that central bank independence is being vigilantly scrutinised. This is an important aspect of the Bank�s public accountability. But I�m sorry to have to be blunt, I�m afraid these arguments are entirely without merit. In a world where the Government has to manage the task of spreading the cost of the pandemic which would otherwise fall on individuals at great cost to them, and the central bank is acting counter-cyclically to support demand in the economy consistent with its inflation target, it is hardly surprising, and indeed consistent, that the Government should be able to benefit from those financing conditions. If the situation was otherwise, and the central bank acted to prevent counter-cyclical policy taking effect, we would be abandoning the remit on which our operational independence is based. Put another way, to be independent does not mean to be disorganised. Independent pursuit of an inflation target does not mean that monetary policy is uncorrelated with other macro policies, including fiscal policy. Indeed in the current circumstances there are mutually reinforcing effects from monetary and fiscal expansions. The consistency of the response of monetary and fiscal policy is something that the IMF has emphasised and recognised in its assessment of UK policy. But that does not mean independence has been abandoned. The interventions we have made are effective because the Bank is independent, and because we will reverse these actions when conditions require that. A fallacy of so-called Modern Monetary Theory is that it believes monetary policy can be used without the credibility of independence and thus without the assurance that price stability will be maintained. Of course, the real test of this may come when we reach the point at which policy needs to be tightened. Actions will speak louder than words. But the great value of central bank independence � and the reason why it is rightly regarded so highly � is because it is a regime that provides the most powerful set of incentives possible, to do the right thing when that time does come. We are                                                   2/3                           BIS central bankers' speeches individually accountable and collectively responsible to Parliament for acting, without fear and favour, to hit the inflation target. Not to do so, as well as being in breach of our statutory duties, would also be found out almost immediately by financial markets. Inflation expectations would become de-anchored. And the policy, even if pursued, would risk being self-defeating. So there is both an institutional and a market discipline at work to mitigate this risk, which means that � while this risk does exist and it is encouraging that it is being scrutinised � in practice it is very unlikely to come to pass. And to be clear, there is no signal on policy in what I have just said. There is one further part to the recent context which is relevant to the institutional set-up of central banks with respect to monetary policy. I mentioned earlier that in the last ten to fifteen years, the shocks to which central banks have had to respond � to which we apply stabilisation tools � have got larger. I well remember that in the very early days of the MPC we had some monthly outturns for inflation which were exactly at 2.5% (2.5% was the original target on a different measure of inflation). Now, in most circles this would be a cause of celebration � we�ve hit the target, and again. As I remember, there were some smiles, but � being central bankers you might say � there was a concern that it could unduly raise expectations on the accuracy of the policy process in terms of outcomes. For the record, it didn�t last, as we knew it wouldn�t. In the last decade or so, the shocks have been larger and the variance of inflation in a number of countries has at times increased, but with a tendency to undershoot. This has been less marked for the UK, but here still we currently face a period of below target inflation. And, as discussed previously, we have moved into a period of inflation targeting in the face of much larger shocks. To be clear, this does not for a moment call into question the benefits of targeting inflation. Indeed, it is notable that over the same period inflation expectations in the UK have not become de-anchored or more volatile, despite the greater economic volatility. But this shift has required central banks to be somewhat more flexible in the way we go about seeking to hit the inflation target, and the tools we use to do this. This is apparent in a number of approaches used by central banks: the adoption of an averaging over time mechanism to calculate the relevant inflation target, thereby allowing some catch-up to account for past inflation shortfalls; allowing inflation to return to target over a longer period of time where there is a trade-off of weaker activity and above target inflation; or using forward guidance such as the MPC is at present in the face of very great uncertainty, so that we make clear that we will need strong evidence that inflation is likely to return sustainably to target before policy should be tightened. These are all ways to use inflation targeting in a world of larger shocks. The key point is that they have required careful adaptation of the approach to monetary policy � evidence that the world doesn�t and should not stand still. In conclusion, I have pointed to four important areas where monetary policymaking is having to adapt. Our decision-making has become more multi-dimensional, with decisions on policy setting and the set of tools that should be available. We should always keep these decisions separate in terms of signalling. Second, the challenge currently is to raise the rate of inflation to target in the midst of a huge shock. This is just as important and underlines the symmetrical nature of our framework. Third, responding to a shock of this scale has led to debate around what it means to be an independent policymaker. This debate is misplaced � the focus must be and always is on the inflation target, the outcome. Last, central banks� approach to inflation targeting has had to be adapted in the face of the much larger shocks we have been experiencing: But, that is in the nature of effective policymaking.

2021-02-11	"Andrew Bailey: The case for an open financial system Speech by Mr Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Financial and Professional Services Address, Mansion House, London, 10 February 2021.                                              * * * As we look forward � and for so many reasons we must look forward � it is important to focus on the future of financial services, and the important role they play in our economy and internationally. This will be my focus today. I am going to look forward with the benefit of history and context and set out why open financial markets are in the interests of all � home and abroad � and something we should always strive for. I want to start with the Bretton Woods agreement towards the end of the Second World War. This was a fundamental and decisive commitment to an open world economy. This commitment did not come free at the time � the adjustment was hard for this country � and of course the more formal Bretton Woods system broke down in the 1970s. But that breakdown did not compromise the commitment shared broadly across nations to an open world economy. There have been times when the commitment has been sorely tested, but it has not been abandoned. What followed the breakdown was a shift of emphasis, not a free for all. The shift was towards managing the consequences of greater openness with much more emphasis on the stability of the financial system and its ability otherwise to do harm, both domestically and internationally. What was needed was not just openness, but safe openness. This emphasis was never more evident than during and after the global financial crisis. There was a moment at the height of the financial crisis when it might have been natural to consider forfeiting the commitment to an open financial system in the face of damaging international linkages. That did not happen to our great relief � the G20 nations stood firm to the principles of Bretton Woods and committed to significantly reforming the international financial system and its regulation, by raising global standards for regulating the system and reinforcing the institutional structure. The Covid crisis has been the first big test of those reforms � and it has been a big test. The scorecard to date is encouraging � by no means perfect, but the core of the system has stood up well, which is needless to say a huge relief. In order to preserve this public good of an open world economy and now also an open financial system, has required a commitment to institution building both internationally and domestically. Bretton Woods created the IMF and World Bank, and slightly less directly the GATT and then W TO. Out of the financial crisis came the importance of the global Financial Stability Board with a mandate to promote international financial stability underpinned by strong regulation, supervisory and other financial sector policies, reinforcing thereby the importance of G20 nations. The FSB works closely with, and is supported by, the four standard setting bodies of the international financial system � the Basel Committee for banks, IOSCO for markets, the IAIS for insurance, and the CPMI for payment and markets infrastructure. And, just to underline the importance we see in these bodies, it is with pride that I can say that the Bank of England chairs two of the four � Jon Cunliffe for CPMI and Victoria Saporta for IAIS. These bodies are where the critical standards for governing the financial system get hammered out, where safe openness is put into practice. They are very clearly global in reach, necessarily so. They are not regional, they are global. We cannot participate in these bodies, and they cannot function as they do, unless we are all prepared to enter into the process and listen to and accept ideas from others. It requires us to give up some control over our standards and rules, because the alternative of a narrow domestic control is illusory � it would jeopardise achieving the very things we want, safe open markets, and likewise open economies. Above all, these bodies enable us to build the trust that enable our financial systems to stay open.                                                 1/4                          BIS central bankers' speeches But, we do not for a moment believe that we can maintain the arrangements we have without change. As the world around us changes, so too do we have to adapt how we achieve these public goods. Also, we do not participate in these global institutions with the intention to water them down, misguidedly because we think this would preserve some notion of our competitiveness as a nation. The UK could not be a global financial centre for long if we did. Let me reiterate again, the public goods of open economies, an open financial system and the stability of that system are global, not regional, in nature. The UK is one of the world�s largest global financial centres, and its financial stability � as the IMF have reminded us � is therefore a global public good. We are deeply committed to financial stability and given that the success of our financial centre. That is not because we are mercantilist in our outlook. As the City�s long history shows, that has never been the outlook of people in the City; rather it has been to trade freely and compete and grow new markets, to face outwards. We see that today for instance in the embrace of fintech. The UK�s financial markets and its financial system are therefore open for trade to all who will abide by our laws and act consistent with our public policy objectives. The question then arises of what sorts of safeguards and rules should apply to that trade? I mentioned earlier that one of the offspring of Bretton Woods was the GATT, subsequently the W TO. The focus of activity was for some considerable time on trade in goods not trade in services. Both goods and services trade depend on robust standards and the regulation of those standards, but trade in services is almost entirely about such standards. This trade has been substantially supported by the global standards to which I referred earlier, and which has allowed countries to defer to each other in terms of the prevailing rules and regulations. This means deferring to the rules of others to protect our citizens or firms when they choose to do business there. There is no doubt in my mind that the work done on global standards since the financial crisis has made this process easier to support and safer and improved the level of trust we have in each other. The European Union has pursued the approach of so-called equivalence, which on the face of it allows for deferring to other authorities where appropriate. The EU�s framework of equivalence in financial services is a patchwork across many different pieces of financial services legislation, taking different forms in different sub-sectors, and in some not present at all. Nor do the equivalence measures prescribe how the judgement should be made. As is well known, the post-Brexit equivalence process between the UK and EU has not been straightforward. It is, of course, two distinct processes � one for the UK to recognise the EU as equivalent to the UK, and one for vice versa. The UK has granted equivalence to the EU in some areas, but the EU has not done likewise to the UK. In a few areas � involving central clearing and settlement � there has been agreement by the EU to extend temporary equivalence to the UK, recognising, I think, the clear risks to financial stability that would have arisen had this not been done at the outset. It would be reasonable to think that a common framework of global standards combined with the common basis of the rules � since the UK transposed EU rules from the outset � would be enough to base equivalence on global standards. Less than this was enough when Canada, the US, Australia, Hong Kong and Brazil were all deemed equivalent. Continuing with the example of central clearing, the EU has recently made the US SEC equivalent for CCPs, subject to certain conditions. These conditions are already met by UK CCPs as they are a legal requirement in the onshored legislation, but equivalence beyond the temporary extension remains uncertain. The EU has argued it must better understand how the UK intends to amend or alter the rules going forwards. This is a standard that the EU holds no other country to and would, I suspect, not agree to be held to itself. It is hard to see beyond one of two ways of interpreting this statement,                                                  2/4                           BIS central bankers' speeches neither of which stands up to much scrutiny. The first interpretation is that the rules should not change in the future, and to do so would be unwelcome. This is unrealistic, dangerous and inconsistent with practice. As the world around us changes, so must the rules to accommodate these changes. As evidence of this, look at what the authorities have had to do in response to Covid and the shock that created for financial markets. The EU is almost constantly revising, or contemplating revising its own rules, and that�s a good thing. So, I dismiss this argument. The second argument is that UK rules should not change independently of those in the EU. I am being careful to phrase this point. It�s not that UK rules might change independently � the equivalence process provides for re-assessment of such decisions, so this should not be a problem. So, it must be the stronger form that they should not change independently. But that is rule-taking pure and simple. It is not acceptable when UK rules govern a system 10 times the size of the UK GDP and is not the test up to now to assess equivalence. It�s worth considering why we would choose to change the rules. First, it would be rare to say the least if such rules turn out always to work perfectly first time and thus need no amendment. As an example of this, the EU itself is looking to amend MiFID2 to iron out areas that need further work. Second, as the world moves on, so the rules need to adapt. If they do not, we will be heading for trouble. The key point here is that good practice means that authorities should be transparent at the time in explaining rule changes, and those changes should be consistent with international standards where appropriate. Let me give three examples of areas of rule changes we in the UK are looking at, two involving banks and one life insurance. First, the Basel regime for banks has, from the outset in the 1980s, applied to so-called �internationally active banks�. The EU has chosen to apply it to all banks and relevant deposit takers. That was a matter of choice. But the Basel regime is heavy duty and complicated when applied to small banks (I know many big banks will say the same, but sorry that�s life). So, we want to see if we can apply a strong but simple framework of rules for small banks that are not internationally active. This is a sensible step in my view and not out of line with the principles and practice of equivalence. Indeed, there are other countries, such as the US and Switzerland that have regimes for small banks and have been determined equivalent to the EU in many areas. Second, the EU changes its rules in December to allow software assets to count as bank capital. The Basel Standards do not include intangible assets in bank capital, which would include software assets in the UK. We have not identified any evidence to support the notion that software assets have value in stress. On that basis, including them in bank capital would give a false picture of a bank�s loss absorbing capacity. We are therefore intending to consult on plans to amend this on-shored EU rule in order to maintain the previous requirements of excluding software assets from bank capital. This is in line with global standards and will enhance the safety and soundness of UK firms. The insurance case rests on a different argument. Solvency 2 is an all embracing rulebook covering both general/non life and life insurance. In practice, it probably works better for the non life world, because the risks and activities are more common across different national markets. Non life insurance is a broad and diverse sector, but each GI product occurs in different national markets in a more similar form. But, I have never been convinced that the EU had a commonality of forms of life insurance across its national markets. They are in some cases at least quite distinct markets and products. Certainly that is the case in the UK, where annuity business is a quite specific activity. Some specific elements of Solvency 2 have not proved to work for that market as well as hoped,                                                   3/4                           BIS central bankers' speeches so it is right that we should review it. There may also be reason to make changes that span both life and non life, but that is not the point I want to emphasise here. Let me be clear, none of this means that the UK should or will create a low regulation, high risk, anything goes financial centre and system. We have an overwhelming body of evidence that such an approach is not in our own interests, let alone anyone else�s. That said, I believe we have a very bright future competing in global financial markets underpinned by strong and effective common global regulatory standards. I want to finish with one further important area, that is, how the rules are applied � supervision as we call it � and how we can be sure that this application of rules is effective across borders, and particularly between the UK and the EU. It is of course critical that rules are applied effectively, and that there is co-operation between the authorities in different countries. With this in mind, we already have 36 MoUs agreed between the Bank of England / PRA and supervisors across Europe. They ensure supervisory co-operation will be deeply engrained in the relationship. And let me welcome the content of the joint declaration on financial services that was contained in the UK-EU trade agreement. It provides for structural regulatory co-operation on financial services, with the aim of establishing a durable and stable relationship between autonomous jurisdictions based on a shared comment to preserve financial stability, market integrity and the protection of investors and consumers. This co-operation will be supported by a Memorandum of Understanding to be agreed by March, and this will enable discussions on how to move forwards on equivalence determinations �without prejudice to the unilateral and autonomous decision-making process of each side�. To conclude, there is no doubt in my mind that an open world economy supported by an open financial system that respects the public interest objective of financial stability will bring the greatest benefits all round. It needs to be supported by effective institutions and strong international standards. But this must be a global, not a regional, regime to be effective. And that is why we spend so much time and effort on the work of the global standard setting and oversight bodies. What follows from that is much more a matter of implementation and how we each put these standards into practice consistently. We have an opportunity to move forward and rebuild our economies, post Covid, supported by our financial systems. Now is not the time to have a regional argument. Thank you.                                                     4/4                           BIS central bankers' speeches"

I wish I could say what a   pleasure it is to be at the Foundation, but that has to remain a hope for the future.     I am going to talk today about the future, the post Covid future as the economy recovers from this traumatic   experience. If I had to summarise the diagnosis, it�s positive but with large doses of cautionary realism.   To summarise, after starting with some description and assessment of the Covid shock to the economy, I am   going to draw out four important points:         ?   Covid has been both a demand and supply shock to the economy, and the recovery therefore has to           be in both elements, unusually so for recoveries I think. Absent a dual recovery, dealing with the           issues that arise will be more difficult.       ?   Second, there are reasons to believe that so-called longer-term scarring damage to the economy will           be more limited than in some past recessions, but there will most likely be structural change which           will influence the future of supply and demand.       ?   Third, it is important to boost supply capacity to raise the sustainable rate of growth in the economy           and thereby ease the task of managing the necessarily higher level of public and corporate sector           debt.       ?   And fourth, taking all of this together, and consistent with the current setting of monetary policy and           the outlook for the economy as set out in the February Monetary Policy Report, it is important to           emphasise the role of the forward guidance that the MPC has adopted, and the announcements           made a month ago on so-called toolbox issues.     The Covid Economy     The economic impact of Covid has in aggregate been very large. We expect that by the end of the first   quarter, UK GDP will still be around 12% below its level at the end of 2019, a huge shortfall. The impact has   been synchronised across economies � the similarities of this shock far exceed the differences in terms of   economic impact. That said, within economies � the UK included � the impact of Covid has been highly   uneven across sectors. Those that conduct activity involving large amounts of close human contact have   obviously been most seriously affected. I would add that this has led to other notably uneven and unequal   effects, because these sectors tend to have higher proportions of low paid workers, female workers, and   there is a concentration by ethnicity as well. This is an issue the Resolution Foundation has done some   commendable work on (Cominetti et al, 2021).     A common question that we ask about economic shocks is whether it is a demand or supply shock. As   monetary policymakers we ask this question with good reason � the identification of shock type matters for                                                                                                                   2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                     2   the impact on spare capacity and inflation. So, what is the answer for Covid? The answer appears to us to   be both: demand and supply. This is not surprising � shutting large parts of the economy down to protect   against infection affects both demand and supply. But this is highly relevant to the task of getting over Covid,   and for monetary policy.     Let me try to illustrate the nature of the Covid shock through the lens of aggregate demand and supply. The   first point to make is that illustrating the shock through a calculation of the output gap alone isn�t very helpful,   precisely because it is the net of two shocks. In Chart 1 I have therefore shown the historical path of   aggregate demand (GDP) and supply (potential output) over the last twenty years, consistent with past MPC   forecasts. I would caution against over-interpreting the detail of this chart, as there are several ways to   represent aggregate supply and demand, and thus the output gap. But, detail notwithstanding, it is clear that   while a gap has opened up between demand and supply during the Covid pandemic, the overwhelming   feature is the coincident hit to both demand and supply. That stands in marked contrast to the more   pronounced impact on demand following the global financial crisis, and persistent period of spare capacity   thereafter.     As well as the Covid shock, the behaviour of supply and demand also reflects the nature of the policy   response, and in particular the so-called furlough scheme (the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme). By   temporarily supporting jobs, this scheme has avoided a much larger spike in unemployment, which would   other things equal have resulted in a smaller fall in supply and a much wider margin of spare capacity.     For a monetary policy maker interested in the output gap and how it will evolve in the recovery from Covid, it   is clear we need to focus on the recovery of both supply and demand. More so than usual, the recovery from   Covid requires a recovery of the supply side. Some of the effects on supply directly related to restrictions on   activity and voluntary social distancing are likely to be temporary, and should start to reverse as the health   outlook improves and along with the vaccination programmes enable restrictions to be eased. Changes in   supply due to so-called scarring and structural change are though likely to be more persistent.     To what extent is the nature and form of economic activity likely to change?     I want next to take a look at a number of key aspects that will underpin the recovery, and in doing so address   a further important question, namely to what extent is the nature and form of economic activity likely to   change, and what will be the implications of that change?     In the November Monetary Policy Report (also Ramsden, 2020) we covered this ground under three   headings: what we buy; what we make; and how we work. The key point is that the impact of Covid has   required and encouraged very sizeable adjustments, but it is far from clear whether or to what degree these   will persist post-Covid and therefore what will be the longer-term impact on the economy. Let me briefly   describe and assess some of the major changes.                                                                                                                    3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                          3   Last autumn, estimates suggested that around a third of workers in the UK undertook at least some of their   job away from their normal place of work. As we all know, remote working has become much more common   and businesses have delivered services in new ways, often using technology to reduce personal contact.   Prior to Covid, only 5% of people in employment worked mainly from home.     There have also been notable changes in the way we consume. Online shopping has surged during the   pandemic, accelerating a pre-existing trend. The latest retail sales figures indicate that it accounts for 35%   of total sales, up from 20% in February last year. Online retailing has the potential to be more productive   than through physical stores, and there is some evidence from the last decade of this already happening.   Higher productivity growth in retailing has not been fully matched by higher wage growth, and this lower unit   cost growth may have contributed to the relative weakness of domestic consumer prices in recent years   (Tenreyro, 2020).     Covid has also caused changes in consumer spending patterns. Much of this has been of necessity, but if   some changes to consumer spending habits persist � for instance if tastes change � the pattern of   production in the economy is also likely to change. The question is how will such a process of more   structural change in the economy happen, and what will be the impact?     What are the implications of the changes we are seeing in the economy?     This is a very big question, so what follows is necessarily quite high level. The answer to the question is   surrounded by a great deal of uncertainty, given the scale and speed of the shock that has caused the   changes.     Let me start with employment and the labour market. In normal UK economic cycles, falls in output are   accompanied initially by relatively small falls in hours worked and then later by larger falls in employment.   Employment, total hours worked and unemployment all tend to be highly persistent, so a rise in   unemployment means � based on history � that it will be higher a year from now. That said, the UK labour   market has adjusted relatively quickly to large shocks in the past (Broadbent, 2012). In normal times, around   9% of workers change jobs every year, but the tendency to persistence provides evidence from the past of   the effects of a mismatch between the skills of job seekers and those required by hiring firms. As I noted   earlier, some of the sectors hardest hit by the pandemic employ more young and low-skilled workers, who   may find it hard to move between sectors (Haldane, 2020). That difficulty will be amplified if the jobs involve   different tasks.     Bank staff have analysed the task content of different jobs to quantify the extent of task reallocation required   in various scenarios. In a relatively extreme scenario where the pattern of consumer spending is unchanged   from 2020 Q3, staff estimate that the extent of the task reallocation over coming years would be higher than   in the recent past, but much less than occurred during the 1980s and early 1990s. That was a period of                                                                                                                   4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                       4   significant structural change during which the share of employees working in the manufacturing sector fell   from 26% to 16%.     There are two important points I would emphasise here. First, the variation in skills demanded by employers   across industries has probably shrunk in a more service oriented economy, which would assist transition   where it is needed. And second, policy intervention, particularly the furlough scheme, will help to preserve   viable employment going forwards, and skills specific to particular jobs or companies, which is a good thing.   Ahead of its May Monetary Policy Report, the MPC will assess the impact of the extension of the furlough   and related schemes, announced in last week�s Budget. My expectation would be that this is likely to reduce   the peak level of unemployment over the coming months. However some rise in unemployment as the   scheme tapers will be hard to avoid.     Just as workers are often specialised, capital such as plant and machinery can be specialised for specific   tasks. The more specialised capital is, the harder it is to redeploy. Bank staff have estimated capital   �redeployability� scores for different types of assets using a similar approach to Kim and Kung (2017).   Information and communications technology, machinery and buildings tend to be highly redeployable, with   uses across many industries. In contrast, there are few alternative uses for aircraft.     Capital may also be in the wrong location even if the pattern of output is similar, if Covid results in such a   change of location, for instance related to the rise of home working. It is also reasonable to think that there   is, and will be, considerable uncertainty over which changes in demand will prove temporary and which will   persist (Vlieghe, 2020). We do know that as of now many people expect working from home to remain more   common after the Covid pandemic is over. Half of new remote workers say they would like to continue to   work from home all or most of the time even when lifting restrictions permits a return to normal working   patterns (Felstead and Reuschke, 2020).     Employers in some sectors also expect the proportion of staff that regularly work from home to more than   double (Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, 2020 and DMP, 2021)1, and many contacts of   the Bank�s Agents expect a hybrid model of two to three days a week spent in the workplace to become the   �new normal� for office workers.     What is the evidence so far for the impact of Covid on productivity and investment? Here we can turn to the   information that comes from the regular surveys of the Bank�s Decision Maker Panel (DMP) (Bloom et al.,   2020). Labour productivity in the UK tends to be pro-cyclical. This does not appear to be the case in the   Covid shock. So far during the pandemic labour productivity per hour appears to have risen, but with a   tendency to reduce over time (Chart 2). There is, however, a lot more going on under the surface. There    1     The February 2021 Decision Maker Panel survey asked businesses for the first time about what proportion of their employees� time   was spent working remotely, both pre- and during Covid, as well as their long-term expectations. Whilst remote working only accounted   for around 8% of total hours worked in 2019, this increased sharply during the pandemic, reaching 43% in 2021 Q1. Moreover, firms   expected remote working to persist into 2022 and beyond, with around 20% of hours expected to be worked from home.                                                                                                                                     5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                                           5   has been a negative impact on productivity resulting from measures taken to contain Covid. Firms in the   DMP estimated that Covid has increased average unit costs by around 7% in the second and third quarters   of last year. They expected this impact to reduce to 5% by the second quarter of this year, with a more   persistent negative impact of 2%. All of this reflects new costs � for PPE, screens etc., and the impact on   costs from social distancing reducing capacity.     However, this negative effect from higher unit costs was offset for DMP members by what is often called a   batting average effect � namely that the impact of Covid has shifted the composition of activity towards   higher productivity firms. But this means that Covid has seen lower total output and higher average labour   productivity. This is consistent with the greater than normal supply side impact of the Covid shock. But this   is not creative destruction in a Schumpeterian sense; in other words that raises output through competition   and innovation. Rather, this is a form of destruction that lowers total output and welfare.     I should also note that evidence on the impact on productivity resulting from greater working from home is   not clear (Barrero et al., 2020 and Haldane, 2020). Reduced travel time is a positive, but there may be lower   innovation and creativity which would otherwise come from people being together more.     I want to finish this section on the economic implications of Covid by highlighting two longer-term and   important developments, both of which pre-date Covid, and neither of which is helpful. First, the UK has   experienced a fall in the average rate of growth, reflecting slower growth in potential supply capacity.   Chart 3 illustrates the four-quarter GDP growth rate since 2000. It is apparent that the average growth rate   has fallen from around 2.5% in the years before the global financial crisis, to around 1.5% in the period   immediately prior to the Covid pandemic. Chart 4 shows the same timeline for aggregate labour productivity   per hour over the last twenty years. Again, the story is not encouraging. Another way of representing this, is   to note that the level of activity in the UK following the global financial crisis is significantly below its level at   the equivalent stage following the 1930s Depression (Haldane, 2021).     Issues arising in the recovery from Covid     I want to return now to the four important points I set out at the start.     First, Covid has been a shock to both demand and supply in the economy. Using an output gap measure on   its own fails to capture the importance of this story. The best we can say is that how the output gap develops   in the recovery from Covid will depend on the net effect of the two, both of which will need to move by more   than in normal recoveries.     There is another element to this part of the story which is hard to assess at present, namely to what extent   the more structural changes we have seen during the Covid crisis will persist, and what effect they will have   on the recovery? There is a lot of uncertainty around these elements, but my best guess is that we will see                                                                                                                        6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                            6   some persistence, not full persistence but not a full reversion to pre-Covid either. We will work more from   home than we used to and shop more on-line because new habits will persist to some degree, and to the   extent they unwind it will be over a period of time.     The second point is that I see reasons to believe that the longer-term negative economic effects of the Covid   shock will be smaller than we have seen in the past, particularly in the 1980s and early 1990s. As I   described earlier, it seems likely that task and job reallocation and capital redeployment has increased since   then, for instance because workers will need less significant retraining to move between sectors. In our   assessment, the supply capacity of the economy is expected to be around 1�% lower than it otherwise   would have been in the absence of Covid by the end of our forecast period. But, of course, there are risks   on both sides of this assessment.     The third point is that, although those sectors which are growing may require new capital, elevated   uncertainty is expected to continue to reduce investment other things equal, weighing on the capital stock   and productivity growth. I have just used the phrase �other things equal� to describe the likely path of   investment. However other things ought not to be equal going forward in my view.     I mentioned earlier that we have had a decade or more of slower growth and weaker productivity growth.   And, as Chart 5 shows, although business investment did recover from a low base following the global   financial crisis, it too was weak in the period prior to the Covid pandemic. This was only partially offset by   growth in government investment, which has also generally been weak over the same period (Chart 6). The   effect of this weakness in investment can also be seen by looking at capital services � a measure of the   value of the flow of services which are derived from the capital stock, including machinery, equipment,   software, structures, and land improvements. This may better capture the drivers of supply growth than   looking at growth in investment alone. It shows a sharp decline following the collapse in investment during   the global financial crisis, and a subsequent recovery, which flattened off as a result of the weak investment   in the period prior to Covid (Chart 7).     The Covid shock has been profound, and has required an increase in public and business debt to smooth   the impact. This is a necessary and sensible response. It means that the economic impact of Covid will be   spread over time � how long we don�t know because it is too early to predict. But that cost has to be   managed, and it will be easier to do that with a higher trend rate of growth, boosted by stronger investment.   Let me add that this investment is also needed to support the transition required by climate change and the   necessity of enabling a more digital economy. These are challenges and opportunities. The message is   simple: stronger growth in potential supply supported by stronger investment and productivity growth will   make the Covid recovery easier.     Monetary policy has a role to play here, in ensuring there is sufficient growth in demand to match any   increase in potential supply growth. The MPC�s actions during the pandemic may also have helped reduce                                                                                                                    7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                        7   the extent of scarring. The Bank�s Financial Policy Committee is also taking steps to ensure there is   appropriate supply of finance for productive investment. As part of this work, the Bank, alongside the   Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority, has convened an industry working group, to help overcome   some of the barriers to investment in productive finance. And finally, growth in potential supply is also being   supported by fiscal policy. Last week�s Budget, and the Build Back Better policy paper released by the   Government alongside it, outlined a range of measures the Government is taking to support economic   growth through significant investment in infrastructure, skills and innovation.     Let me end on the fourth point, what does this all mean for monetary policy? There is a growing sense of   economic optimism, in markets and in consumer and business confidence measures. The rate of new Covid   infections is declining, and the vaccine programme is a huge achievement. There is light at the end of the   tunnel. A note of realism though: our latest forecast in essence painted a picture of an economy that starts   at a lower level of activity as a result of the current restrictions and people�s natural caution associated with   the renewed onset of Covid, which then gets back to where it was pre-Covid by the early part of next year.   The level of activity in a year�s time is broadly similar in the February forecast as it was in our November   forecast, although the recovery is faster because the starting point is lower.     There is good news in that projection, with a rapid recovery later this year, and inflation returning to around   our 2% target. That recovery is assisted by the continued support the MPC is providing through low interest   rates and quantitative easing, and in my view it amply justifies our current stance on monetary policy. But let   me dwell for a moment on three important elements of the MPC�s decisions. First, we will continue to   execute the announced programme of asset purchases, which we expect to be completed by around the end   of 2021. Second, we have in place an important piece of forward guidance, which states that:     �If the outlook for inflation weakens the Committee stands ready to take whatever additional action is   necessary to achieve its remit. The Committee does not intend to tighten monetary policy at least until there   is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2%   inflation target sustainably�.     This guidance is a recognition of the scale of the shock, the high level of uncertainty and the risks around the   Covid recovery, which are still on balance distributed on the downside, though less so as time goes by. It is   deliberately state contingent, in other words it sets out that there is a burden of proof we will need on the   sustainability of the recovery. But it does not deviate from the usual medium-term nominal anchor, the 2%   inflation target. And in this context it is encouraging that measures of inflation expectations have remained   relatively stable in the UK, despite the seismic shocks and unprecedented policy response we�ve   experienced over the past year.     This recognition of the uncertainty and risks around the recovery has been backed up by separate decisions   the MPC took in February on the toolbox measures we can employ. We have been quite clear these toolkit                                                                                                                   8     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                       8   decisions should not be interpreted as a signal about the future path of monetary policy. We decided to ask   the banks to make preparations within the next six months, in case we need to use negative interest rates to   provide further support. This implies nothing about our intentions in that direction, and nor does it imply that   negative rates are our chosen marginal policy tool, something that in my view is state contingent at all times.   We also signalled that the Bank will do work on the approach it would take to tightening policy, should that   be needed, again recognising that it has more than one tool to do so.     These decisions are detached from our current or likely future policy decisions, but do recognise the   increasingly two-sided nature of the risks we face, as we hope and expect to see the economy get over   Covid.

2021-03-26	"Banknote character - speech by Andrew Bailey     Given at the unveil of the Alan Turing �50 polymer Banknote i                                                   Banknote character ? speech by Andrew Bailey | Bank of England   Page 1 Published on 25 March 2021         Andrew Bailey reveals the design of our new polymer �50 banknote. He talks about why      Alan Turing was chosen to feature on it.        Turing was a mathematician and a pioneer of early computers. His critical work on      codebreaking saved the lives of many people in World War Two.       He was also gay at a time when it was considered a crime. In 2017 a new law named      after Turing pardoned all men, like him, who were convicted based on their sexuality.        Our new note celebrates Turing as someone who embodies the spirit of our country and      left a legacy for LGBTQ+ rights.        The note will enter circulation on Wednesday 23 June, which is Alan Turing�s birthday.    Speech It�s my great pleasure to unveil the new �50 note, which will feature one of Britain�s most important scientists, Alan Turing. Turing is perhaps best known for his codebreaking work during World War II, which played a decisive role in bringing that conflict to an end. But he is also recognised as being a pioneer in computing and artificial intelligence, and someone whose work has had an enormous impact on how we all live today.  The process of selecting Turing started when we asked the UK public to �Think Science� and put forward nominations for scientists they would like to see appear on a banknote. We had an overwhelming response, with nearly 250,000 members of the public making a nomination. I�m glad that so many of you wanted to be a part of this process. There's something of the character of a nation in its money, and we are right to consider and celebrate the people on our banknotes.  We were aided in the selection process by our Banknote Character Advisory Committee, made up of seven external members and two members of Bank staff. The Committee had the unenviable task of narrowing down the nearly 1,000 unique nominations to a shortlist of just 12. Each of those on the shortlist were hugely significant in their own right, and collectively the shortlist celebrates the important contributions scientists have made to our nation's history, and indeed, our leading position in scientific research. However, it was Alan Turing who was ultimately selected. I�d like to reflect on why that was.  I think, at the root, it�s because Alan represents something of which we�re all very proud. Even if we can�t precisely articulate the reason.  I believe that part of the answer lies in him being someone who, not content with abstract ideas, applied himself to the physical embodiment of those ideas. And from his sheer force of will, came enormous leaps of progress. Perhaps it is because we now find ourselves confronted by a pandemic and climate change, and relying greatly on original thought, and scientific innovation, that Turing's values and achievements resonate so strongly with us today.                                                                 Banknote character ? speech by Andrew Bailey | Bank of England   Page 2 Banknote features And we�ve tried to reflect those many achievements on this new note, which I�m very pleased to now unveil.  Turing is perhaps best known for his code breaking work at Bletchley Park during World War Two.  Here, far from being the solitary genius he is sometimes caricatured as, Turing led a team of codebreakers who designed a machine which could be used to decipher German military codes, something once thought impossible. This machine was known as The Bombe, and the technical drawings for it are featured here on the note. Until Turing and his colleagues invented this machine, British Intelligence had employed codebreakers to crack these German cyphers manually. But the sheer complexity of the codes meant they had little success. The early computers which Turing helped design would decipher some of these codes in as little as 15 minutes, giving the allied forces an invaluable military advantage.  Historians have credited this work that Turing led at Bletchley Park, with shortening the war by as much as 2 years, saving many millions of lives in the process.  But Alan Turing�s contributions to the field of computing start even before his wartime efforts. In 1936, he wrote his seminal work �on computable numbers�, and this research formed the basis for modern day computer algorithms. We can see some of the calculations from his paper in this table on the new bank note. In his research, he demonstrated how, what he called universal machines, could perform any solvable computation they were presented with. Of course, these universal machines are what we now call computers.  Quite simply, his mathematical research in 1936 laid the foundations for modern computer science.  After the war Turing returned to computing, but this time helping turn it into reality. Moving to Manchester to work at the National Physical Laboratory, he dedicated the next few years to designing the UK�s first electronic stored program computer. And here is an image of that invention, along with the diagrams Turing drew when designing it. The ACE Pilot machine, although much larger than anything we would use today, was one of the world�s first computers.  Recognising the potential for computers to revolutionise the world around us, Turing delivered his now famous quote, when describing the ACE Machine. �This is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is to be�. He has turned out to be prophetic.  And this is reflected in one of the key security features of the note � a two colour foil featuring a microchip image over the main see-through window. Within this are two gold foil squares, which change between a pound symbol and the number �50� when tilted.  Above and below the micro-chip image are green metallic sunflower shapes, and on the back of the note, a red foil patch containing the letters �AT� is based on the image of a sunflower head. These sunflower images reflect Turing�s ground breaking morphogenetic work. This new branch of developmental biology which Turing pioneered, was the study of algorithms underpinning the formation of patterns in nature. The way a leopard�s spots develop into patterns, or the way the seed heads on a sunflower spiral. Turing found a way to predict these using maths. Here, also, we see him laying the foundations for a new scientific field.  His contributions to Britain�s war effort and its scientific status, make the circumstances of his own death all the more poignant. Though guarded about his private life, Turing�s sexual orientation wasn�t a complete secret at the time. He was arrested under indecency laws in 1952, after the police learned of his relationship with another man. The tragic events surrounding this arrest would eventually lead to Turing taking his own life, at the age of just 41.  In 2017 the Turing Law was passed in memory of Alan, pardoning all men who, like him, were convicted based on their sexuality. Another legacy for which Alan Turing can be remembered.  The Turing �50 completes our family of polymer banknotes, which already include the �5, �10, and �20 pound notes. These polymer notes are more secure than their paper predecessor, and I'm very pleased that we have made this important transition.

These are the figureheads who grace our other banknotes, and through their leadership and cultural contribution, they helped shape the vibrant society that is modern Britain.  The person chosen to feature on a currency, can embody the spirit of a nation. In his remarkable achievements, Turing did just that. And in doing so, showed us the way to the future.  As the artist Anthony Gormley remarked, Alan Turing ""unlocked the door between the industrial and the information age�. And although Turing was under appreciated in his lifetime, we can now see how accurate this description is.  Alan Turing was a gay man, whose transformational work in the fields of computer science, codebreaking, and developmental biology, was still not enough to spare him the appalling treatment to which he was subjected. By placing him on this new �50 banknote, we celebrate him for his achievements, and the values he symbolises, for which we can all be very proud.

2021-04-18	"Andrew Bailey: Meeting varied people Speech by Mr Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, at Diversity in Market Intelligence: Launching our Meeting Varied People Initiative, 21 April 2021.                                                  * * * Thank you Andrea for that introduction, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. People often talk about diversity in terms of the makeup of their own workforces � and for a public institution like the Bank, it is vital we reflect the whole society we serve. This includes both identity and cognitive diversity, which are equally important. 1 I often say I don�t want to work in a place that is full of people like me.2 I want the Bank to have an inclusive and open culture where people speak up, ensuring we make better decisions by mitigating the risks of groupthink and myopia. Over recent years, a number of my colleagues at the Bank have also emphasised the importance of diversity and inclusion, both for us as an employer, and as a wider public good for the financial sector. 3 We have made significant progress internally: for example, launched our Out & Proud Action Plan in September 2020, and continue to sponsor the �Women in Finance� Charter. 4 But there is always more to be done, which is why for example we recently initiated a review, led by our Court of Directors, on ethnic diversity and inclusion. I know that many of you are doing similar work within your firms. As Andrea mentioned, the focus today is our approach to encouraging diversity in our financial market intelligence contacts, and the networks we engage with. Our priority is to speak to a diverse group of people from a broad range of financial institutions. Our discussions with market participants help us understand market developments, and the implications for our Policy Committees. So all of the arguments about why diversity is important internally here at the Bank of England hold just as firmly when we engage with you externally. We are embedding that approach into our core market intelligence framework, to underscore our commitment. So why is this a priority for us? First and foremost, it�s the right thing to do. As a public institution, we need to represent the diversity of the country in what we look like, who we talk to and the impact of our decisions. But, just as importantly, it helps us achieve our objectives. Our mission is to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability. And diversity in its many forms is a critical part of delivering that mission. Improved cognitive diversity helps make for better decision making. The lack of such diversity has been highlighted as one important factor in the bank and regulatory failures of 2008.5 Having a diverse range of institutions and business models brings positive benefits for financial system resiliency6 � something that you will not be surprised to hear matters a great deal to the Bank of England! Diversity in who we speak to in financial markets has even more direct benefits. It improves our understanding of what is driving markets, what people expect from future policy and the potential impacts of different decisions. And that is critical � because financial markets are global, complex and interconnected. A failure to understand those diverse components heightens the chances of making analytical, and hence policy, mistakes. Speaking to only one subset of banks, for example, could mean policy calibrations have unintended consequences for different market participants. Only looking at established financial assets risks ignoring the impact of innovation. And speaking only to contacts of similar backgrounds could mean missing different perspectives                                                     1/3                            BIS central bankers' speeches on potential risks to consensus views. Having that breadth of diverse perspectives allows us to act more quickly and decisively in a crisis too. In March last year, financial market stress caused by COVID-19 across the world led to investors looking for safe haven assets and cash. The conversations we had with market participants like you during this period were essential to building a picture of what was happening across a wide range of different markets, and assessing the steps we, and other public authorities, needed to take to maintain economic and financial stability. To take one example, the intelligence we gathered from you about the stress in the commercial paper market helped the Bank and HM Treasury to plan, design and launch the COVID Corporate Funding Facility in record time, and ensured it was priced appropriately. Similarly, our market intelligence helped ensure that the other elements of the policy response last year were also rapid, decisive and well calibrated to the underlying risks. Of course, diversity has affected our other outreach activity too. When I first started working at the Bank of England in the mid-1980s, the Bank�s only public statements came mainly from the Governor for instance at the annual Mansion House speech. We have moved a long way since then, and we see outreach as core to how we operate. In an important sense this change naturally accompanied the decisive shift to the Bank having clear and independent responsibility for monetary policy and the stability of the financial system. With those responsibilities went a duty to reach out and communicate much more broadly. Our network of regional Agents help us with ensuring we speak to companies and organisations from across the country. We created Citizens Panels � held regularly all over the country in person and, for the time being, virtually � to understand how the public view the economy. 7 Our Community Forum programme enables us to meet with those who run third-sector organisations, as well as the people they support, across the UK. Our work in diversity and inclusion extends to our role in creating an inclusive financial sector and I am pleased that with the input of many in the Islamic finance community, we are launching the Alternative Liquidity Facility (ALF) during the course of 2021.8 So diversity matters to us. The update of our Market Intelligence Charter and the UK Money Markets Code, published today, will embed diverse outreach into our working practices and help make diversity within financial markets a core standard of best practice. The Charter sets out our aims and ambitions of talking to a diverse range of contacts and affirms our commitment to open engagement, with an emphasis on challenge and diversity of thought.9 The updated Code, which the FCA have recently again recognised as an industry standard, puts the expectation to promote and develop a diverse team upfront, alongside other core principles of best practice, highlighting the benefits of accessing a wider range of skills and thinking. 10 This approach is also being in embedded in our outward-facing markets committees. We currently have two main committees: the Money Markets Committee and the FX Joint Standing Committee. We have been working with members from both committees to diversify their membership for some time now: including working to ensure women in senior roles are represented; and that the committees see a wider range of presenters at different stages of the career. This is yielding results: specifically, female representation � which is one aspect of diversity that has been historically lacking on many senior-level committees � is now approaching half on the UK Money Markets Committee, and has climbed to around a third for the FX Joint Standing Committee in the past 18 months. These changes were driven by the Bank but importantly with the full support of the external members. We want to continue to work together with all of you here on this agenda. We look forward to hearing your ideas, suggestions and questions through the panel discussion coming up shortly, and in our networking session with our market intelligence teams later on today.

There is a very important further issue in all of this, which is sadly highly topical, namely to ask what is the antidote to the problem of lobbying? The answer is not to speak to no-one. That is not likely to lead to good decision making. The answer is to be rigorous about speaking to a diverse range of people to get their views. We look forward to engaging with you in the future, working together to understand financial market developments from a diverse and varied range of perspectives to inform our policy committee decisions.

He says using robust      overnight risk-free rates will help to create a more resilient and transparent financial      system.    Speech Many thanks to Tom [Wipf] and the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) for the invitation to join today�s SOFR symposium and to John [Williams] for his remarks.   Introduction I have spoken on the transition from Libor each year since 2017 when we set out that despite the significant improvements in its governance and oversight, there were increasing challenges in anchoring the submissions on which those rates were based, to the greatest extent possible, in actual transactions.  The underlying market that Libor seeks to measure � the market for unsecured wholesale term lending between banks � is no longer sufficiently active to support such a widely used reference rate. This has not changed in the last four years.  At that time we highlighted the market disruption that could stem from an unplanned disappearance of Libor. Working together with the panel banks and the wider market, it was in the interest of all involved that we stabilised those rates until such times as transition arrangements were sufficiently well advanced.  Well the summit, or summits that are the cessation dates for Libor are now clearly on the horizon with the FCA announcing earlier in the year that Friday 31 December 2021 will be the final publication date for panel bank sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and euro Libor rates along with a number of lesser used US dollar tenors. The remaining US dollar tenors will cease in mid-2023.  These summits have been on the horizon for over a decade and have been well signposted but they are now clearly visible, but as any climber will tell you the hardest part of mountaineering is often the descent. It can often be more treacherous than the climb. So with the market having definitive dates for the end of Libor � I am going to focus my comments today on descending safely � remembering the important role benchmarks play in the financial system and why financial firms and borrowers would be well served in choosing the most robust alternative reference rates that meet their use case.  Transition from Libor was always going to be challenging given its widespread use, but to those looking for an easy descent by substituting Libor for credit sensitive rates that do not address all of its fundamental weaknesses, they risk much of the good progress that has been made. While these rates may offer convenience as a short-term substitution, they present a range of complex longer term risks. And while they may remove the reliance on expert judgement, they veneer over the fundamental challenges of thin and incomplete markets through the extrapolation of data. The ability of such rates to maintain representativeness through periods of stress remains a challenge to which we have not seen adequate answers.   Developments in sterling markets So what is the position in sterling markets? Back in 2017, a reformed SONIA rate was recommended by the Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates (RFRWG) as the alternative risk-free reference rate to sterling                                                   Descending safely: Life after Libor ? speech by Andrew Bailey | Bank of England   Page 2 Libor. This was in my view a good choice reflecting the liquid and active markets upon which it is based. This makes it inherently more robust. Since then, the RFRWG and UK authorities have co-operated on recommending a series of industry milestones to build liquidity in SONIA. These milestones have been positioned ahead of the cessation of sterling Libor at the end of this year. We don�t apologise for this � it is focussing attention, and providing a clear roadmap to support the development of deep and liquid markets in robust alternatives to Libor and facilitating a smooth transition.  In line with the RFRWG milestones, alternatives to GBP Libor should have been offered to borrowers since the start of October last year. And from the end of March this year, the majority of new GBP Libor business should have ceased, further shifting demand to those increasingly deep and liquid risk-free rate markets.  New sterling floating rate note issuance has almost exclusively referenced SONIA for some time. In the sterling swap market, the share of SONIA-referencing swaps has regularly dominated the Libor equivalent for 10 months now[1], with continued progress since the �SONIA-first� interdealer quoting convention switch last year.[2] Indeed, the dealer to dealer market has completed a transformation in risk traded with SONIA in excess of 70% vs. Libor, with progress across all tenors. If we remove the direct market element and focus on pure inter dealer market, we estimate this is now in excess of 90% SONIA.[3]  These positive developments in linear derivatives (e.g. interest rate swaps) have filtered through into more complex derivative markets, with SONIA swaptions, caps and floors widely available and infrastructure being put in place to support these products. Today is a further landmark, with another �SONIA first� initiative as the interdealer market looks to shift liquidity in these more complex non-linear products from Libor to SONIA ahead of the upcoming end-Q2 milestone to cease new Libor linked issuance.[4] This is not to say there is an outright ban on trading Libor in non- linear sterling markets after this milestone. In line with our consistent message of supporting a smooth transition there is a �risk management� exemption to help firms support their clients as liquidity in Libor decreases and end users actively transition to more robust alternatives.[5]  I will, however, offer a warning to those firms regulated by the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) who may be guilty of what I�ll call �lazy� behaviors in unnecessarily sustaining Libor linked contracts. UK supervisors have been consistent and clear that they support the industry-agreed milestones of the RFRWG and have set their expectations in line with these. Across regulated firms the necessary reporting is in place and your supervisors will be speaking to you. The transition away from Libor is a risk management issue and relevant senior managers in firms will be responsible for ensuring suitable policies and oversight are in place. Firms regulated by the PRA in the UK that fail to prudently manage transition will be treated in the same way as firms demonstrating any other risk management / governance failings.  As in other jurisdictions, lending markets have presented their own challenges. Market conventions and relevant infrastructure to support the use of overnight rates have been slower to settle and implement. But the industry and authorities have worked through these challenges together, and we see overnight SONIA compounded in arrears is now being actively used across billions of pounds of GBP facilities.[6] This includes bilateral, syndicated and multicurrency deals across a wide range of domestic and international users spanning a large range of commercial sectors. Similar to the experience in the GBP bond markets, compounded in arrears rates have quickly established themselves as a robust and useable market standard. They offer borrowers a transparent rate based on substantial volumes of real transactions and lenders a durable rate that will function through a range of scenarios.  It is promising to see the progress made in SONIA and as liquidity continues to shift, the benefits of transitioning new business from Libor becomes even clearer. But it is also imperative we have a clear path for existing or �legacy� Libor contracts to transition in a robust manner. Legislative processes in the US, EU and UK continue to progress in establishing safety nets for those contracts that can�t actively transition ahead of cessation. Strong adherence to the ISDA IBOR fallbacks protocol, in the US and UK in particular, has been encouraging. Clearing houses are also following suit with their own conversion processes on similar terms. We estimate over 97% of sterling interest rate derivatives have a robust safety net in place.[7] But more can and should be done � the protocol remains open for entities that have not yet adhered and it is critical that equally robust fallback arrangements are adopted in cash products too.                                                   Descending safely: Life after Libor ? speech by Andrew Bailey | Bank of England   Page 3 While it is always the right choice to install the safety net to break your fall in the form of fallbacks, this shouldn�t be seen as a substitute for pre-emptive action, ensuring a sure footing on the descent. Active transition ahead of LIBOR cessation remains an important part of easing the gradient of that descent � it ensures contractual certainty and allows borrowers, lenders, issuers and investors to retain economic control over their contracts. GBP bond markets are again leading the way, as we have seen over 50 bonds with a value of around �40 billion actively transitioned from GBP Libor to SONIA.[8]  Where tough legacy contracts are able to take advantage of that safety net, for example in the form of the proposed synthetic Libor we should be clear that this a temporary solution.[9] Supervisory engagement will continue after the end of this year to ensure regulated firms continue to manage that rump and move those exposures onto robust alternatives where that is possible. As those facilities re-new, in most case they should move to the most robust rate available, where we expect the most liquidity to be � in sterling that will be SONIA compounded in arrears.   The use of forward looking term risk-free rates Let me now turn to the critical element of any journey � the destination. The reference rates the market transitions to are important choices. A broad-based transition to more robust overnight risk-free rates can provide the safe descent from Libor we set out to achieve, to a more resilient and transparent financial system.[10]  Active and liquid underlying markets underpinning overnight rates have demonstrated resilience and we expect liquidity to move to these markets.[11] But there are also specific and limited use cases where forward-looking term rates may help facilitate this journey. We have seen constructive engagement in the UK. In 2018 the RFRWG surveyed the sterling market � and to be honest, we received a mixed response on the role of term rates, but with a small majority supporting a limited role for them.[12] The UK authorities have been supportive of the development of forward-looking term SONIA rates for limited use in cash markets. These rates have now been available for use in sterling contracts since January.[13] But while a narrow majority of the market made the decision to support the development of those rates, a broader consensus has firmly endorsed the limited use case for such rates. It has done this through the RFRWG but also through the FICC Markets Standards Board (FMSB) that has published a proposed market standard that considers limited use cases where there is a robust rationale for use of forward term SONIA, to meet specific needs, such as in trade finance and Islamic finance products.[14]  Let me be clear � forward-looking term rates can support transition. But let me be equally clear in setting out that a broad-based transition to the most robust overnight rates � for sterling that is compounded in arrears SONIA, underpinned by deep underlying markets, will support a stronger more transparent financial system and ultimately benefit all market participants.   Moving to the most robust reference rate Despite being the London Inter Bank Offer Rate � transition is of course as much an international, as it is a domestic effort. Indeed John and I have co-chaired the FSB group co-ordinating work on the transition to more robust benchmarks for a number of years now, ensuring co-ordination between authorities from the five Libor currency jurisdictions but also more broadly across the wide range of jurisdictions that are exposed to the Libor benchmarks.  One of the challenges of transition is how embedded Libor has become in our economies and indeed how widely it is used across a broad range of retail and wholesale financial products � far broader than originally envisaged. Clearly alternatives to Libor need to work for domestic markets but given Libor�s role in many of the products and services that interconnect our financial systems, it is important a robust transition is delivered across all the Libor currencies. And the signs here are positive, industry groups in each jurisdiction were established to recommend alternatives to Libor. It is no accident that each industry group has, in my view, taken the sensible decision to recommend risk-free rates.  As we approach the points at which the Libor panels will cease, it is worth pausing to reflect on what the underlying challenges with Libor benchmarks are and making sure that in finding suitable replacements we move to solutions that don�t replicate those weaknesses. Any failure to address these weakness will pose risks in the domestic                                                     Descending safely: Life after Libor ? speech by Andrew Bailey | Bank of England   Page 4 markets that use them but will potentially export those risks into other jurisdictions through international markets, for example through offshore markets, multi-currency lending and cross currency derivatives trades.  We need to learn the lessons of Libor, and ensure we complete this transition in a way that minimises the risk of us having to undertake a similar exercise in the future. And across markets we have seen progress in building liquidity in those selected risk-free rates and demonstrating a wide use case. The tools are there to support use of these rates through the production of indexes and calculators that we are seeing emerge. The transition from Libor should be done once and it must be done right.  As I have already mentioned, there has continued to be low levels of actual transactions in the markets Libor seeks to measure and the rate has had to remain heavily reliant on �expert judgement�. However, the inherent weaknesses in Libor making it a less reliable and more volatile rate are more accurately captured by three linked factors:     The lack of underlying transactions on which to base the rate?    The use of expert judgement to supplement the rates where actual transactions are not available? and,    The impact of the underlying liquidity dynamics of the markets being referenced.   To address these weaknesses, alternatives to Libor need to address all of these factors and not just reducing the likelihood of the application of judgement.  With banks moving to greater use of retail deposits and secured funding, rather than short-term wholesale interbank markets, Libor increased its reliance on transactions grounded in the commercial paper (CP) and certificates of deposit (CD) markets. This increased Libor�s vulnerability to short-term illiquidity effects apparent in these markets and the amplification of price moves. We have seen how liquidity in these markets can fall away rapidly leading to sharp moves in rates that reference them during periods of stress � most recently during the market reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic last year. For example three-month USD Libor rose by over 50 basis points in the second half of March 2020, at a time when observable transactions were diminishing and official US rates were reduced by 100 basis points.  Outflows from money market funds (MMFs) were a key driver of the frictions underpinning Libor during March 2020. Credit quality was not the primary concern given the regulatory reforms to money market funds post the 2008 crisis. Instead we saw a �dash for cash� and pronounced redemption dynamics. In prime institutional MMFs there were 20 consecutive days of outflows between 6 and 26 March 2020.[15] Redemptions in such funds have been a regular feature of market dislocations and it is these funds that underpin the CP and CD markets that provide many of the reference transactions for Libor.  Many of these new credit sensitive rates continue to reference these markets and when liquidity drops away they seek to expand their �daily� data sets through the use of rolling windows, giving the appearance of larger underlying volumes. Additionally executable quotes are also sometimes added (albeit at a lower weighting). The use of regression approaches introduces significant model risk and fitting of data to try to demonstrate stability � what is a lot less clear is how stable these rates will be in the future as these underlying market continue to evolve, especially against the backdrop of the potential for further money market reform.  It is therefore not clear to what extent alternative credit sensitive benchmarks have truly addressed the weaknesses of Libor. These rates, which are being promoted by some as alternatives to the selected risk-free rates have only a fraction of the underlying data points and are still exposed to the liquidity premia inherent in Libor. Building new benchmarks from small, and shrinking markets can create large and sudden movements in those rates that immediately get passed on to borrowers with contracts linked to those rates.  It is easy to understand why lenders may find credit sensitive alternatives attractive in the short-term, but what is less clear is why non-financial borrowers who look to their financial service providers to help them manage their risks would want to see their cost of borrowing being driven by thin liquidity in CP and CD markets. And it is clear they don�t, in a survey of borrowers by the Alternative Reference Committee�s Nonfinancial Corporates Working Group in March this year, over 80% of respondents would prefer alternatives based on SOFR than on credit sensitive alternatives.[16] In fact if lenders looked past the short term benefits of substitutability they too would see that when                                                   Descending safely: Life after Libor ? speech by Andrew Bailey | Bank of England   Page 5 the limited durability of these credit sensitive rates is combined with the need, and in some jurisdictions the requirement, to ensure there is access to robust fallbacks the sensible option is to make your primary rate selection the most robust you can.  In the UK there is a clear consensus that credit sensitive rates are not required or wanted as part of sterling LIBOR transition and in my view this is sensible. Widespread use of RFRs will ensure we are using benchmarks that will remain transparent to users and embed rates that have long-term durability for the future.   Conclusion The use of SOFR in US dollar markets is growing. We know liquidity attracts liquidity, it is clear there is demand from borrowers and we welcome initiatives to continue to increase SOFR usage. There is also broad international consensus to support the US authorities and limit new use of US dollar Libor from the end of this year. So with the summit in sight let�s reflect on how far we have come in what was always a challenging climb, but let�s also make sure we complete the job properly and safely descend the mountain that is Libor.

2021-05-13	"Andrew Bailey: Taking our second chance to make MMFs more resilient Speech by Mr Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) 35th Annual General Meeting, 12 May 2021.                                                 * * * Introduction Thank you for inviting me to speak today. I want to start by thanking ISDA for the important work you do, and in recent times particularly Scott O�Malia and his colleagues for working with central banks and regulators to manage the transition away from Libor. Your support on this complex transition has been hugely important. You may be relieved to hear that I am not going to talk about Libor today. I did speak on the subject yesterday, it�s on the Bank of England�s website if you are interested (Bailey, 2021). Instead, I am going to speak about another important part of our current work and a priority for the global Financial Stability Board (FSB), namely Money Market Funds (MMFs). The FSB analysed last March�s so-called �dash for cash� in their Holistic Review published at the end of last year, highlighting a number of vulnerabilities in non-bank finance and setting out some considerations for reforms required to tackle the issues we saw in that episode (FSB, 2020). MMFs were one of the issues at the top of that list. MMFs also played a role in amplifying the stress we saw during the Global Financial Crisis, so this is the second time they have proven not to be sufficiently resilient. I plan, therefore, to set out my views today on the reforms required to solve these issues. We are committed to working with others internationally, through the FSB, to avoid history repeating itself yet again. Background to the issues posed by MMFs In talking about money market funds, it is important to put them into a wider context. Several aspects of that context are important, including: their historical origins, the role they played in amplifying stresses in the global financial crisis, the direction of reforms following that episode, and the position of the funds relative to both banks and the broader investment fund landscape. To start, briefly, with some history. In the US, money market funds emerged in the 1970s when regulation capped the interest that banks were allowed to pay on deposits at a level below money market yields. Money market funds were set up to mimic bank deposits by maintaining a stable value of USD 1 per share while offering money market yields to investors. Thus, money market funds gained a reputation as a profitable alternative, which proved attractive to many different types of investors. Higher returns, however, rarely come without greater risk. During the global financial crises, some of the underlying fragilities of these structures came to the fore. In particular, the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008 contributed to one of the most prominent MMFs � the Reserve Primary Fund � �breaking the buck�, as its share price fell below USD 1. As investors realised there was a risk they may not receive their original investment in full, or that their holdings in MMFs may be suspended, a run on other funds followed, contributing to the extreme volatility in money markets and broader financial markets observed at the time. Following the financial crisis, considerable work was undertaken to build the resilience of MMFs. In 2012 the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) published policy recommendations for the regulation and management of MMFs. Many of the reforms that were subsequently implemented have helped improve the resilience of MMFs, however it is clear they                                                   1/6                            BIS central bankers' speeches did not go far enough in solving the underlying problems. And in some cases they may have had unintended consequences, such as the introduction of a link between the level of illiquid assets held by a fund and the potential use of tools (such as fees or gates) to manage redemptions during periods of stress. While introduced to manage potentially disruptive outflows, these changes have made funds more sensitive to so-called cliff edge effects � thus increasing an incentive to exit before the gate closes. One of the important, broader changes in the financial system post financial crisis has been the shift in the importance of bank and non-bank finance, with the latter growing relative to the former. This is not accidental: the post crisis reforms meant that there were asset classes which were no longer suitable to hold in large scale on the balance sheet of banks. It is worth spending a moment on this point because it has an important parallel in the issues concerning money market funds. Banks are primarily funded by deposits, where the contract is understood to be to return the full value of the deposit plus whatever the interest rate is � usually �on demand� and without delay. Banks are held to high standards by regulators � including through liquidity and capital requirements, and regular stress tests � to ensure that they are well placed to be able to honour depositors� demands. Central bank liquidity operations, resolution arrangements and deposit insurance further reinforce confidence in this promise to return the deposit. Thanks to the post financial crisis reforms, bank deposits are therefore cash or money- like in most states of the world. At the other end of this spectrum are investment funds of many sorts. Most are not meant to be cash-like, in the sense that the promise is to return the fruits of the investment strategy, which may be more or less than the amount invested. Cash-like certainty of value is not part of the contract. If only it was that simple. There are at least two problems which are evident in how this system operates � or possibly two variants of the same problem. First, there are instruments which at least in some of their existing forms are neither one thing nor the other � neither properly cash- like nor properly investment-like. Second, there are instruments which are meant to be investment-like but which become regarded as cash-like. There are structural vulnerabilities in the financial system caused by both of these problems in the non-bank world. And the dash for cash episode was the sort of stress event that nearly caused the problems to crystallise in a big way, and arguably would have done so but for the rapid intervention on a substantial scale by the authorities. Lessons from the March 2020 �dash for cash� episode Let me put this into the context of the role of money market funds and what happened during the dash for cash. I will describe the events using evidence from sterling money markets, and then draw on some broader evidence (the UK story is very well described and assessed in Hauser (2020)). The dash for cash was, of course, a broader financial system � and indeed economy wide � phenomenon, driven by the underlying health shock and its economic implications. Nonetheless, money market funds are an important part of the dash for cash story because they seek to bridge between the desire of investors for immediate liquidity (in other words a cash or deposit- like desire) and the desire of the banks, in which they invest a sizeable part of the funds, for term funding in the form of commercial paper or certificates of deposit. They are therefore carrying out a form of maturity transformation which in times of stress can become prone to runs. In total, sterling money market funds saw outflows of around �25bn; or 10% of their total assets, in the eight days between 12th and 20th March last year. At first, the outflows were met by running down their holdings of cash, but as the outflows increased, they sought to liquidate some                                                  2/6                           BIS central bankers' speeches of their bank assets � CDs and CP. But they found that the market for those assets � which typically comes primarily from dealers buying back their own paper � was closed. The dash for cash meant that the tide was flowing fast against them. As the regulatory system currently works, if MMFs� liquid asset ratios fall towards prescribed thresholds, and they are unable to top up their liquid assets (cash) through sales, they are able to �gate� or impose fees on investors, in other words decline to provide immediate liquidity. As with banks, the broader danger of this situation � which is a threat to financial stability � is that such a problem in one fund could trigger contagion to other funds, through fear that they might have the same problem, and thus lead to a highly destabilising run on money market funds. These thresholds can, therefore, also affect the behaviour of fund managers, making liquidity buffers not usable in times of stress, for fear this would fuel investors� desire to run. It is also important to note that another consequence of the rising demand for cash, and the failure to meet that demand by selling assets, was a sharp rise in money market rates. The rise was sharpest at longer money market-tenors, but there was also a pickup in overnight repo rates. This was a particularly serious sign of market dysfunction in what are core markets, and a serious challenge to our ability to implement monetary policy by keeping these rates broadly aligned to the official Bank Rate. It resulted in an increase in the cost and reduction in the availability of credit � to the financial system, other companies and households � precisely at the time they needed it most. There was therefore a serious threat to both monetary policy and financial stability, in other words both of the core purposes of a central bank. It was an existential moment. We took two actions which eased the pressure, and did so quickly. First, on 19th March the MPC decided to buy gilts in large size and at high speed. At its peak the pace of gilt purchases reached �13.5bn per week, more than twice as fast as in early 2009. The use of this broad monetary policy tool was warranted given the widespread nature of the dash for cash, and the implications of the pandemic for the economic outlook. Other central banks took similar decisions around the same time. This helped to stabilise markets and reversed the dash for cash and thus the flows out of money market funds. Second, the Bank activated its Contingent Term Repo Facility on 24th March, committing to lend unlimited amounts of reserves at close to Bank Rate against a broad range of collateral. Taken together, these operations brought money market rates back to more normal levels. The Federal Reserve in the US also launched a specific liquidity facility aimed at easing the stresses in dollar denominated MMFs. Turning the fire hoses on at full blast worked and cured the immediate problem. It is always worth remembering that all of this happened at a time of a global pandemic and a historically unprecedented collapse in economic activity. So, it is hardly surprising that large and rapid actions were necessary. It helped that the situation in respect of both monetary and financial stability called for such actions, so there was no conflict between the two. Moreover, this was an international shock, in at least two important respects. First, by its nature the global pandemic was affecting a very large number of economies and financial markets. Second, money market funds, and particularly dollar denominated funds, provide funding to a wide range of banks internationally and are used for cash management by investors and corporates across the world. For instance it is common for US funds to buy dollar paper issued by European banks, and vice versa. So the transmission of the dash for cash was not constrained by borders or national markets. US Prime MMFs saw large outflows, with net redemptions of 30% from prime MMFs offered to institutional investors over a two week period (President�s Working Group, 2020). This contributed to the effective closure of the market for short-term dollar funding (FSB, 2020). US government MMFs, on the other hand, saw huge inflows over the same period. A similar pattern was also seen in dollar denominated MMFs in Europe.                                                   3/6                            BIS central bankers' speeches The important conclusion I draw from this review of the experience of the dash for cash is that while we can reasonably conclude that the actions taken meant that the immediate problem was tackled, in doing so some serious issues which represent a threat to the stability of the financial system were revealed. Hence, it is right that a very large amount of effort is going towards tackling these issues. Much of the rest of my remarks will set out and assess where we have got to. Reforms to make MMFs more resilient It is clear from experience that money market funds as currently structured may often be perceived as cash-like, but cannot make good on this expectation in a sufficiently wide range of market conditions, and so can contribute to stress in short-term funding markets. The objective must be to improve the resilience and functioning of MMFs to protect the stability of the financial system. In doing so, it is also important to recognise that the reforms after the financial crisis did not tackle this issue conclusively. I should note that the remaining vulnerabilities in non-bank finance are perhaps the exception, as on the whole the post-crisis reforms have left a financial system that has stood up well to the acute stress of the Covid period. In order to create a framework for reforms, it is important to set out clearly the principles that should shape the changes. The following principles � while not intended as prescriptive rules � are I think helpful in this respect:  1. As a general principle for all funds � investment and money market � redemption terms     should be aligned with the underlying liquidity of assets.  2. Where investors regard funds as cash-like, they should be made resilient so they can     operate as such at all times, which means running minimal maturity mismatch risk.  3. Money market funds should not hold less liquid assets on a scale that would make them     more suitable to be traditional investment funds.  4. Money market funds should not be designed with regulatory thresholds or cliff-edges which     create adverse incentives and amplify first-mover advantage behaviour.  5. Reforms should improve the ability of funds to support short-term funding markets, including     by making them more resilient. These principles may sound obvious; indeed, I hope they do. But I would emphasise that they are not obvious in the sense that the current landscape is some way from meeting these principles. I think there are three big picture changes which follow from these principles, and should form the basis of the necessary reforms. I will set out each of them, and then discuss the issues that arise from them. First, we should remove the adverse incentives introduced by the liquidity thresholds related to the use of suspensions, gates and redemption fees. Second, we should simplify the landscape to make clearer the critical distinction between cash-like funds and investment funds. We should remove the ambiguity of intermediate descriptions such as low volatility funds. Third, and to support removing the ambiguity, it will be important to define in an accounting and substantive sense more explicitly what constitutes cash-like. Current guidance leaves a lot of judgement to managers and auditors to make these decisions on a fund by fund basis1. Money-market funds are a cash management instrument, so it may seem odd that the meaning of cash-like as a term has not been well defined. The resultant ambiguity may have seemed convenient as a means to stretch the boundary of the definition to allow less liquid instruments in, but when a stress event like the dash for cash happens, the flaw is badly exposed and financial stability is in jeopardy. The authorities then have to intervene in scale to restore well-functioning markets, but that should not be the accepted way to run the system.                                                    4/6                           BIS central bankers' speeches That said, the definition of cash-like therefore needs to be clear and appropriate rather than over- prescriptive. For many purposes it does need to provide near instant access to cash � i.e. quick redemption of a holding in a money market fund should be assured. But there are situations where, say, holding a three month tenor instrument is appropriate because it satisfies treasury management objectives. The critical need is to avoid ambiguity of definition and mismatches between an instrument�s liquidity and its use. Funds that do not meet this requirement should be clearly labelled and treated as part of the investment fund world, serving a different purpose (where there are also issues, but these are not my focus today). You may well say �he really is labouring this point�. Yes I am, because the post financial crisis reforms did not tackle it conclusively. So, what reforms are required to establish money market funds as cash-like without ambiguity? The first thing to say is that no single reform will solve things on its own. We must identify a coherent package of reforms that address the current vulnerabilities in the money market fund sector. It is easiest to describe three broad approaches to illustrate the potential options available that could deliver this objective. These are intentionally somewhat stylistic, to draw out the trade- offs we face in addressing these issues. First, at one extreme, asset holdings could be limited to government instruments. Given the low risk and liquid nature of these instruments, run risk would be materially reduced. The existing size of the sterling T-bill and gilt repo markets may, however, limit the extent to which this solution would be achievable in sufficient scale to meet the needs of sterling investors, at least in the near term. And this would of course also have significant implications for the funding of banks. Second, at the other extreme, the liquidity mismatch could be removed by making funds non- daily dealing � i.e. not cash on demand. This would require a term notice period. Such a fund would be somewhat like a term deposit with no break clause. This would fundamentally change the potential uses for which MMFs could be held, and so would also have repercussions for the demand for other instruments, such as bank deposits, the implications of which would require further consideration. Third, there may be a middle option whereby a combination of measures are used to reduce the risks to a sufficiently low level. We have a menu of options to choose from. For instance, a limit could be introduced on the percentage of assets a money market fund could hold in non- government instruments, to reduce the holding of less liquid assets. This could be combined with making sure funds are structured as variable net asset value, albeit with this asset mix the variability of the value in the fund should be lessened. And we would need to ensure the absence of regulatory cliff-edges, so that funds could be more confident to release their cash buffers in times of stress to meet withdrawals. Run risk would be reduced but not eliminated, and it would be more likely that in a stress funds could sell a so-called vertical (representative) slice of their assets. This is important for an agency-form collective investment structure. There may though still be some first mover advantage to exit in this structure, so great care would be needed to design it in a way which doesn�t fall foul of the familiar issues missed by the post financial crisis reforms. Each of the three options I have just outlined may not be mutually exclusive. Properly differentiated, there may be a role for funds of each of these types, to suit the needs of the diverse set of existing MMF investors. We may end up with some MMFs becoming more cash- like and some less cash-like, but we need to avoid the muddy middle. Conclusion In conclusion, we are very much in the world of having a second chance to deal with the issue of how to structure money market funds consistent with their role.                                                   5/6                           BIS central bankers' speeches The FSB will shortly be consulting on what reforms would be most appropriate. The Bank of England remains very supportive of the work being taken forward by the FSB and under the Italian G20 presidency. Given the cross-border nature of MMFs, it is important we work together internationally to ensure that we are aligned in our objectives, and adhering to common principles, even if the precise implementation varies a little to reflect the specific nature of each jurisdiction�s markets. The dash for cash provided an unwelcome reminder that the post financial crisis did not finish the job and left a dangerous gap in our exposure to the risk of financial instability. We must finish the task this time. Thank you.

2021-06-03	"Andrew Bailey: Tackling climate for real � the role of central banks Speech by Mr Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, at Reuters Events Responsible Business, 1 June 2021.                                                * * * The Bank of England�s mission is to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability. Our understanding of how we can best deliver that stability, and what factors are relevant to it, evolves with time. This is unsurprising as our economy and financial system are not static, so neither should be how we go about fulfilling our mission. The UK economy and financial system have undergone significant transformations in recent decades � as examples of this, services have risen and manufacturing has declined as a share of output1, debit card transactions have overtaken cash transactions2, and the share of activity in the financial system accounted for by non-banks has risen3. These types of structural shifts have had broad effects, including in our world on the transmission of monetary policy and the resilience of the financial system. We have taken action in response; for example after the financial crisis we increased capital requirements for banks so the financial system could act as a shock absorber rather than amplifier � the benefits of which we have most recently seen in the response to Covid-19. Just as we have had to adapt to these changes, to fulfil our mission going forwards we need to look ahead to the structural shifts we face over the coming years and decades. That will mean hearing central bankers like me speak about things that we have not in the past � terms like central bank digital currencies, cyber risk, and climate change are now firmly part of our lexicon. This is not about us adding new things to our mission, nor is it about doing that which is rightly for others. It is about taking these new things into account alongside the old as we go about fulfilling our mission, delivering monetary and financial stability through time. Climate change Climate change is an obvious, and indeed urgent, example of this. The physical effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels and more frequent severe weather events, as well as the transition to a net-zero economy, through changes in government climate policy, technology and consumer preferences, create financial risks and economic consequences. The question is not if but where, to what extent, and how should we respond. Answering all three of those questions has been at the heart of our work on climate change over the past 6 years. Ignoring them is not an answer. Indeed the longer we wait, the greater the costs of adjustment. The UK was one of the first countries to embed in legislation a commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.4 Meeting that goal will require an unprecedented structural shift in the economy, particularly on the supply side. Everything from the way we produce and consume goods and services will need to change for this economy-wide transition to take place. The primary levers for driving that transition rest not with central banks, but with governments through setting climate policy, with industry through innovation and investment, with private finance through allocating investment, and with consumers through the choices they make. These important and difficult decisions bring both social and economic consequences.5 Role of central banks                                                   1/5                           BIS central bankers' speeches So what then is the role of central banks? Let me start by emphasising what it is not. We are not here to �solve� climate change or drive the transition. Those with the mandate and the tools to lead this fight sit elsewhere. But central banks do have a role to play, and an important one at that. Our economy and financial system are not immune to planetary-level changes or society�s response to them, indeed it would be absurd to suggest otherwise. Elon Musk aside � we cannot diversify away from our exposure to the planet. In that sense climate change is the ultimate systemic risk. Physical risks can damage property and other infrastructure6, disrupt business supply chains and food systems, influence productivity and health, and, more broadly, can lead to potentially wide displacement and even conflict. This can reduce asset values, result in lower profitability for companies, damage public finances, and increase the cost of settling underwriting losses for insurers. Transition risks, arising through changes in climate policy, technology and shifting consumer preferences could prompt a reassessment of the value of a large range of carbon-intensive assets � leaving some �stranded�. In turn, this will give rise to credit risk for lenders and market risk for insurers and investors. Yet these physical and transition risks are not reflected in the market prices of most financial assets.7 Structural barriers such as the lack of climate disclosure, the lack of clear sector-level climate policies, firms not internalising the cost of emissions, and the short time horizon of some investors, all contribute to what Nick Stern has described as the greatest market failure the world has ever seen.8 A sharp shift towards a new equilibrium as a result of recognising the full extent of this market failure could create significant financial losses in a �climate Minsky moment�. Maintaining monetary and financial stability in light of these risks therefore demands a timely, coherent and coordinated policy response from the authorities. The importance of the Bank�s role in this has been recognised through the Chancellor�s recent remit and recommendation letters to the Bank�s policy committees, which set out that the transition to a net-zero economy is now a part of the government�s economic strategy that the committees must have regard to.9 So what does this mean a central bank should do in practice? Financial system First, and foremost, it means building resiliency at a micro and macro level. We do this by ensuring the financial system proactively manages and pre-emptively mitigates the financial risks from climate change. That task falls squarely within the mandate of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Policy Committee (FPC). The PRA has set supervisory expectations for banks and insurers to ensure they adopt a strategic approach to climate change and develop capabilities to effectively identify, measure, manage, and where outside appetite, mitigate the financial risks from climate change. This is a necessary component of protecting the safety and soundness of PRA-regulated firms. The FPC, alongside the PRC, will launch next week a Climate change Biennial Exploratory Scenario exercise � the CBES � to assess the resiliency of individual banks, insurers and the wider financial system to different climate scenarios. This type of scenario modelling and analysis is critical to enabling real decisions on climate-related risks by financial firms and policymakers. Assessing resiliency against a range of scenarios enables us to prepare for what might happen in the absence of certainty about what will happen.                                                   2/5                           BIS central bankers' speeches Some have called on us to go further and incentivise change through imposing lower capital requirements for �green� exposures and higher capital requirements for �non-green� or carbon- intensive exposures. As the prudential regulator, any incorporation of climate change into regulatory capital requirements would need to be grounded in robust data and be designed to support safety and soundness while avoiding unintended consequences or compromising our other objectives. In my view, the case for this has yet to be clearly established and possibly may never be. But our work to improve climate disclosures, scenario analysis, and risk management, could help unlock such assessments. Macroeconomy Beyond the financial system, achieving economy-wide net-zero emissions will require greening the way we heat our buildings, manufacture industrial goods like steel and cement, generate electricity and produce food. This could prove to be an opportunity for the economy to regenerate ageing capital and raise productivity. Analysis done by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and National Institute for Economic and Social Research by 2050 suggests that such an orderly transition could lead to some increase in global GDP, and lower unemployment relative to prior trends. These positive effects should be larger in countries like the UK that are net importers of energy. However, as I mentioned earlier, much of that rests on how the transition proceeds. The lesson from previous episodes of structural change is that they never involve a frictionless re-allocation of capital. And a disorderly transition, where more severe policies are introduced later in the horizon to compensate, could result in both lower growth and higher inflation from rising energy and materials costs in the economy. In either case, the economic impacts from such transition scenarios over the medium term will likely be much lower than the growing challenges from physical risks. Under current climate policies, which are insufficient to reach net-zero emissions, analysis from the NGFS scenarios suggest that up to 13% of global GDP would be at risk by 2050, even before accounting for the potential consequences of severe weather events. Monetary policy These risks to the economic outlook make climate change and the transition to a net-zero economy also relevant factors for the conduct of monetary policy. The typical policy horizon for monetary policy is two to three years, and so many of the effects of climate change (particularly tipping points) will manifest beyond that timeframe. But the effects of climate change matter for monetary policy because structural shifts in the supply side of the economy can affect not only future point-in-time macroeconomic variables, but also the expected natural rate of interest (r*) and the natural rate of unemployment (u*). The physical and transition risks from climate change are relevant to these issues, although the economic modelling and research to estimate the relative size of these effects has only started to emerge in recent years. To take one example of the complexities involved in making such an assessment, the natural rate of interest might face both downward pressure from expectations of severe weather events10 and upwards pressure from demand for investment to replace carbon-intensive capital stock (such as replacing petrol cars with electric ones). This dynamic is not unique to climate change. We see it in other structural shifts such as the post financial crisis trend of weak productivity, and the growth in intangible capital.11 To improve our understanding and better inform future monetary policy, we need more research on this topic. I am pleased to say that the Bank plans to do more in this space, both in its own capacity and through working with other central banks and international bodies.                                                 3/5                           BIS central bankers' speeches As well as being relevant to the setting of monetary policy, climate change and the transition to net-zero are also relevant for the implementation of it. The Bank recently became the first central bank to set out a comprehensive framework for greening a monetary policy asset portfolio � the �20bn stock of sterling corporate bonds acquired via our Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme (CBPS).12 This will remain a monetary policy tool, with its overall target stock of assets set by the MPC in order to achieve its primary inflation objective. However, from Q4 this year we will make adjustments to our approach to the composition of this portfolio in order to incentivise companies to take actions contributing to an orderly transition to a net�zero economy. Given the relatively small scale of these holdings � in the context of sterling and global capital markets � we hope this change will by example influence how larger investors take account of climate risks in their own asset allocation decisions. Some may worry this change moves us away from central banks� core responsibilities, into territory best left for governments. However, the case for taking this action is clear, it is in line with the change in the MPC�s remit I described earlier, and far from impeding the effective execution of our policy objectives, it may well contribute to a future outcome that delivers a more stable monetary and financial system. Conclusion I have spoken about the relevance of climate change and the transition to a net-zero economy to central banks. It is about faithfully executing our mission for monetary and financial stability, taking into account those structural shifts on the horizon. That brings with it several analytical challenges and demands new ways of thinking � we welcome this. But it is clear that the biggest component of the journey to net-zero rests not with central banks, but with government, through the delivery of sector-level climate policy pathways � without these the real economy cannot adjust effectively. That is one element of uncertainty in climate change within the gift of governments to solve, and many are working hard to do so. I will be speaking later this week at the Green Swan Conference where I will set out in more detail the work the Bank has done on climate change and where we go from here. As we look ahead to a decade that climate science tells us must deliver real climate action, I can promise you this, the Bank of England will continue to play its part.

Over recent decades, our global economic system has faced multiple shocks or swan events, ranging from   the Covid-19 pandemic to the global financial crisis of 2007/08. But if we turn our eye to the future, we can   see another swan lurking in the reeds, and it�s green. That green swan is why we are here today, the threat   posed to our economies and our financial system by climate change.     Central banks, regulators and policymakers came together in the aftermath of the financial crisis to reform   the system so that it could better weather future shocks. Like before, we must come together again to   address the threat of climate change. But unlike before, we cannot wait until the aftermath to do so.     On Tuesday I spoke about the role central banks have to play on climate change and that, far from   representing an entirely new objective, the Bank of England�s work in this space sits firmly within the bounds   of our mission to maintain monetary and financial stability.1 We have an important role to play, but it is   governments, businesses, investors, and individuals that have the most difficult and impactful decisions to   make in driving the transition to a net-zero economy.     Today I want to build on those remarks to reflect on central banks� climate-related work to date and to   consider how it will need to evolve if we are going to continue to meet our remit. I will address this by talking   about three main areas of our work: firstly, improving the understanding of climate-related financial risks   across the financial system and macroeconomy; secondly, developing and embedding climate risk   management in the financial firms that we regulate; and finally, seeking to achieve best practice through our   operations as a central bank.     I will begin with our work to understand climate risks across the broader financial system and the   macroeconomy.     The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) has continued its pioneering work in this space,   through the publication of climate scenarios that provide a common starting point for analysing risks to the   system2, and the latest version of these scenarios is due to be published soon. The scenarios bring together   the financial and economic impacts of different temperature and climate policy pathways � a critical input for   firms and policymakers to understand the future impact of the decisions they are making today. Scenario   analysis makes questions like how resilient is this business, this financial system, or this set of policies, to   each climate scenario possible to address.     Accordingly, the Bank continues to be a strong advocate of the NGFS� work and in 2019 announced our   intention to assess the resilience of individual banks, insurers, and the wider UK financial system to different    1       See �Tackling climate for real: the role of central banks� speech by Andrew Bailey, June 2021   2       NGFS climate scenarios                                                                                                                      2     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                          2   climate scenarios through a Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario exercise (CBES). I am pleased to say that   exercise, which draws on the NGFS scenarios, will launch next week on 8 June.     The CBES will involve the UK�s largest banks and insurers and explore three different climate scenarios,   testing different combinations of physical and transition risks over a 30-year period. It is an important tool to   size the financial exposures, to understand how different bank and insurance business models will be   affected and how they might respond, and finally as a way of improving firms� risk management practices   through the process of carrying out the exercise.     Firms should use the design of the CBES and the underlying NGFS scenarios to inform their own scenario   analysis, build their understanding of the climate risks they face, and enhance their climate risk management   capabilities. I hope it will act as a catalyst, increasing firms� knowledge of the risks they face, and   incentivising them to take steps to address these risks. In turn, this will require firms� clients in the real   economy to improve their understanding of how climate change and the transition to a net-zero economy   could impact their businesses and operations.     Lessons learned from the CBES will also be shared with the NGFS as part of the collaborative approach   taken by central banks, and on that note, I want to commend the ACPR�s recent publication of its own   ambitious scenario exercise for the French financial system. 3     Through both its scenario work in the NGFS, and its internal analysis, the Bank has developed a clearer   understanding of where climate knowledge gaps persist and what these might mean for our objectives. For   example, there is particular value in the deepening of our understanding of the macroeconomic implications   of climate change and the pathways to net-zero. It is for governments to set out a pathway to net-zero and   the policy levers that will be used to deliver it. But as central banks, we will need to understand any   implications of the transition for the economic outlook and our potential policy responses.     The NGFS have started to explore this, but more work will be needed as the impacts of climate change and   the transition to net-zero start to come into sharper relief. At the Bank, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)   recently had its first informal discussion on the macroeconomics of climate change, and climate is an   increasingly important part of G7 discussions between central banks and finance ministries.     But more work and discussion is needed. Specifically, there is particular value in: (1) further integrating   climate and macro modelling; (2) understanding and sizing related transmission channels; (3) going beyond   the aggregate impacts to understand sectoral implications; and (4) assessing how the transition might affect   the demand and supply sides of the economy. What is increasingly clear is that the effects of climate      3    See A first assessment of financial risks stemming from climate change: The main results of the 2020 climate pilot exercise,   ACPR, May 2021                                                                                                                                   3     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                                       3   change and the transition to a net-zero economy will manifest over time - so analysis needs to span the   short, medium and long-term to capture fully these effects.     Let me now turn to how we are embedding climate risk management in the financial firms that we   regulate.     We have worked to deepen our understanding of risks to the financial system and build resilience to climate   change both at the macro and micro prudential level.     At the micro-prudential level, the good progress regulators have made through climate-focused fora such as   the NGFS and Sustainable Insurance Forum (SIF) has catalysed work across international standard setting   bodies and other authorities including the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the   Financial Stability Board (FSB). On that note, I welcome the FSB taking a more strategic and central role on   climate-related financial risks across the wider financial system.     In the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) set out supervisory expectations for banks and insurers   on the management of the financial risks from climate change in April 2019.4 We have provided further   guidance for firms on these expectations and have set a deadline for firms ambitiously to embed them by the   end of this year.5     Of all the building blocks required to manage effectively climate-related risks, climate disclosure is among the   most essential - not only for transparency and for risk management purposes, but to facilitate the flow of   capital towards investments that are consistent with an orderly economy-wide transition to net-zero.   Consequently, it is also integral to the UK�s legislative commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.     For these reasons, the Bank has long supported the FSB�s Task Force on Climate-related Financial   Disclosures (TCFD) 6 and has worked with the UK Government and regulators to progress further and   implement mandatory disclosures requirements across the UK economy by 2025.7     Yet climate change is a global issue, which no nation can solve alone. Elon Musk aside - we cannot diversify   away from our exposure to the planet. Therefore, information disclosed by firms across jurisdictions needs to   be consistent and comparable to be useful in driving decisions. That points to the need for further   international collaboration on consistent approaches to disclosures requirements, for example the work of the   IFRS�s proposed International Sustainability Standards Board can serve as a useful minimum baseline.      4     See Enhancing banks� and insurers� approaches to managing the financial risks from climate change, April 2019   5     See Letter from Sam Woods �Managing climate-related financial risk � thematic feedback from the PRA�s review of firms� SS3/19 plans   and clarifications of expectations�, July 2020   6     Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures   7     See UK joint regulator and government TCFD Taskforce: Interim Report and Roadmap, November 2020                                                                                                                                    4     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                                           4   Looking ahead, we need to ensure these initiatives are not only delivered but built on. To illustrate this, I   believe there are some key areas of work we will all need to address over the coming period. For example,   the quantitative mapping of the carbon intensity of firms or activities to financial risks and losses remains   relatively unexplored. This is understandable � it is a complex area as data remain scarce, scenario analysis   is still in its infancy, and worldwide, government climate policies do not yet fully internalise the cost of   emissions.     As I noted earlier this week, the biggest component of the journey to net-zero is the delivery of clear   sector-level climate policy pathways by governments. Central banks cannot and should not try to fill any gaps   in that space through their micro and macro-prudential actions - for example, we are not here to deliver   carbon pricing. However, we should use these tools to fulfil our role over important areas such as those I am   raising today.     The final area I want to explore is the importance of central banks practicing what we preach by   seeking to achieve best practice through our own operations.     We hold ourselves to the same high standards that we expect of the firms we regulate. Consequently, we   need to ensure that, wherever possible, our own financial operations, such as financial asset portfolios we   hold, and our own physical operations, such as emissions from our buildings and printing banknotes,   conform to best practice in the measurement, management and mitigation of climate risks. In line with this, I   can confirm today that the Bank is committing to reduce emissions from our physical operations so   they will be consistent with net-zero by 2050 at the latest.     In the spirit of transparency, last year we published a TCFD aligned climate-related financial disclosure.8 The   most challenging aspect of this report was the inclusion of analysis of the emissions associated with a   monetary policy portfolio, a first for a central bank. In our forthcoming report for 2021, which will be published   in the next few weeks, we have sought to build on last year�s content to provide additional context and   analysis.     In March last year, I outlined our intention to assess ways that our holdings of corporate bonds could be   adjusted to take the climate impact of issuers into account whilst still meeting our monetary policy   objectives.9 Last month we set out in a Discussion Paper our proposals for �greening� our   Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme (CBPS).10 There is no template for a comprehensive framework for   greening an asset portfolio held for monetary policy purposes. We know that outreach and engagement is      8     See The Bank of England�s climate-related financial disclosure 2020, Bank of England, June 2020   9     See Appointment of Andrew Bailey as Governor of the Bank of England, March 2020   10      See �It�s not easy being green � but that shouldn�t stop us: how central banks can use their monetary policy portfolios to support   orderly transition to net zero� speech by Andrew Hauser and Options for greening the Bank of England�s Corporate Bond Purchase   Scheme, Bank of England, May 2021                                                                                                                                           5     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                                               5   critical in getting this right, and so are currently seeking feedback on our proposed framework. We are keen   to hear from a range of experts and stakeholders over the coming weeks to inform our next steps.     The need for us to act in this space was clear and unambiguous. First, there is increasingly persuasive   evidence that emissions, and so climate risks, are systematically underpriced in financial markets. This   means that continuing to replicate the structure of the sterling corporate bond market, without taking explicit   account of the climate impact of bond issuers, is no longer in fact a truly �market neutral� approach. And   second, the remit of the MPC was updated in March this year to clarify that, subject to achieving price   stability, the Committee should support the transition to net-zero as part of the government�s economic   strategy.11     The CBPS will remain a monetary policy tool, with its overall target stock of assets set by the MPC in order to   achieve its primary inflation objective. However, from Q4 this year we intend to modify our approach to the   composition of assets we buy, in order to take account of climate considerations.     Our approach will be guided by three principles. First, we will look to incentivise companies to take decisive   actions which contribute to an orderly transition of the overall UK economy to net-zero. Second, given the   relatively small scale of the CBPS in the context of capital markets, we will seek to influence the thinking of   other, larger investors, as well as learning from them. Thirdly, our requirements of firms will become more   demanding over time, including as improvements in data and metrics allows us more precisely to monitor   climate behaviour, and further to sharpen the incentives we set. The Discussion Paper sets out how we   intend to operationalise these principles and incentivise firms to put in place, and abide by, credible plans to   reduce emissions over time.     Conclusion     As I have outlined, we have come far, but have further to go. When it comes to climate change, we cannot   stand still. We need to continue to be bold and learn from our work so far to deepen our understanding and   inform future actions. Greater ambition and cooperation is still needed, including wider adoption of best   practices. For this reason, as well as evolving our domestic work, we also need to evolve our collective   approaches.     This year presents central banks, regulators and policymakers with a unique opportunity to do this, and I   have been encouraged by the progress we have made in the G7 and G20 in the build up to COP26. Under   the UK�s Presidency, the G7 has started meaningful discussions on the role of finance ministries and central   banks in the transition to net-zero. Under Italy�s Presidency, the G20, through the Sustainable Finance   Working Group and the FSB, is developing climate-focused roadmaps to coordinate and galvanise     11        See MPC Remit statement and letter and FPC Remit letter, March 2021                                                                                                                 6     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                      6   international work. These fora allow us to share experiences and develop common best practice. Listening   and learning how others are thinking about the potential macroeconomic, macroprudential and   microprudential implications will be important to that.     In addition, this year COP26 has an ambitious agenda that spans all of the areas that I have spoken about   today � in particular establishing a better understanding of best practice, and fostering greater technical   cooperation. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ)12 initiative will do this by bringing   together over 160 firms (responsible for assets in excess of $70 trillion) for the first time. Such technical   collaboration and cooperation is no less important among central banks and supervisors. The NGFS with the   scope of its membership is key to that exchange of knowledge. The Bank has widely shared what we have   learnt and we will continue to do so.13 The creation of the Central Banks� and Supervisors� Climate Training   Alliance (CTA) will also further support technical cooperation and assistance on climate risks.     Let me conclude. In spite of the Covid-19 pandemic, central banks have continued to make progress in   responding to climate change, but we know there is still work to be done. The next stage of our journey will   require us to deepen our analysis, evolve our approaches and further our collaboration. The coming year will   be critical for all of us on this journey � in allowing us to better convert climate change risks into something   that we can tackle for real.       12        See New Financial Alliance for Net Zero Emissions Launches, UNFCCC, April 2021   13        See Centre for Central Banking Studies, Bank of England                                                                                                                      7     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches and @BoE_PressOffice                          7"
2021-06-15	Andrew Bailey: Innovation to serve the public interest Speech by Mr Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, at the City UK Annual Conference, 15 June 2021.                                                 * * * It�s a pleasure to be participating in the City UK Annual Conference. Amongst the themes you have chosen, I will focus on innovation, and how we think about and assist innovation as public policy makers. In doing so, I will draw on our work on payments and digital currency, including an important paper on the latter that we published last week. To cut to the end briefly, I believe that as public policy makers we have to be clear on the rules of the road that innovation needs to follow to serve the public interest, and in doing so be clear that innovation can rightly challenge those rules and cause them to adapt. But, what we cannot have is a world where innovation gets a free pass to ignore the public interest. The odds of such an approach not ending well are too high. It follows that as public policy makers we need to provide a lead in setting out these rules of the road and be prepared to think openly about how they can be fitted to changing circumstances. This requires early engagement, something we are seeking to do on digital currency. Playing catch up with public policy is not a recipe for success. There will inevitably be elements of tough love in such a process, and some disappointed ambitions, but I am confident that out of it will come a robust form of innovation. I hope also that laying out the principles of public interest and how they should be put into practice in the context of new innovation will help to deal with another difficult and perennial challenge of financial regulation. It is in the nature of innovation � and a good thing � that while some ideas succeed, many fall by the wayside. How many people remember Visi On, TopView and GEM? I have to admit I did not until I did some research for today. In the mid-1980s, they were rivals to Windows for the personal computer software market. More precisely, they were briefly rivals, but the rest as they say is history, as were these three rivals. In our world of finance, things can be more complicated, because dealing with failures itself raises public policy issues. There are quite often suggestions that central banks and financial regulators are anti-innovation and lukewarm on competition, because the results will at times be messy as the winners emerge and the losers fall by the wayside. We are not anti-innovation or anti-competition, but we are trying to manage our sphere of influence in order to achieve our public policy objectives, as required by Parliament and serve the public interest continuously. With that in mind, let me apply the framework to the world of payments and digital currency. It is no exaggeration to say that this is the beating heart of central banking, it�s where it all comes together. The Bank of England�s mission is to promote the good of the people of this country by maintaining monetary and financial stability, and a key way in which we fulfil this is to ensure people have confidence in the money they use, whether to store wealth or to make payments, and that it is an effective unit of account. At the heart of this is confidence in the value of money, meaning confidence in its monetary value not being eroded by inflation, in other words monetary stability, and confidence in the system and institutions in which it is held and transmitted in transactions, in other words financial stability. A useful practical definition of this meaning of stability comes from a saying by Alan Greenspan, namely that monetary stability is when people�s decisions on spending and investment are not influenced by their concerns and expectations about the value of the money they are using. It is possible to extend that saying to cover aspects of financial stability too, for instance in terms of being concerned about the safety and soundness of individual banks. There are two forms of money in use in the UK � and there is nothing unusual about the UK in this respect. Central bank money is a liability of the Bank of England. It is available to the public in                                                   1/4                            BIS central bankers' speeches the form of cash, and to commercial banks in the form of reserve accounts held at the Bank. Private money takes the form of deposits in commercial banks, held by the public � our bank accounts. Central bank money anchors the system � it establishes and maintains sterling as the monetary unit of account in this country. It does that by having the full force backing of the state. But it is a small part of the overall monetary system, and increasingly so when viewed through the lens of payments. The use of cash in payments has been declining for some time, and the pace of decline has picked up during the period of Covid. Somewhat paradoxically, the amount of cash in issue has not declined, and there are sections of the population who continue to rely on cash. To be clear, we have no plans to end banknotes. Commercial bank money is widely used as a means of payment, a store of value, and for making loans in the real economy. But use of commercial bank money has come to rely on its relative efficiency, the regulation of the banking system to ensure its safety and soundness, depositor protection, and public confidence that commercial bank money can be exchanged for central bank money in the form of cash at all times. Bank deposits � commercial bank money � therefore provide a single location for both the store of value and means of exchange functions of money. Payments can be and are still made in central bank money, but increasingly less so. Bank accounts are connected to a range of payment systems which provide the infrastructure to carry out the exchange of commercial bank money. These payment systems are also subject to public interest regulation focused on robustness, safety, and fair competition between them. Viewed like this, an observer might say that this set of arrangements looks efficient. I would say that this has become increasingly the case in recent years as the options for making domestic payments have increased, particularly with the innovation of Faster Payments, in which the UK has been a leader. But that does not mean we should rest on the laurels and proclaim the end of innovation. New forms of digital money represent an important source of innovation, so we must evaluate whether and how they can meet our public interest objectives. A key point here is that rather than use commercial bank money as the basis for transactions, providers of digital money would create and use their own money or �coin�. And, they could be issued by companies, including large technology platforms, with the capacity to scale up and grow rapidly. These are often known as stablecoins. They are distinct from cryptoassets such as Bitcoin, which have no backing and thus no anchor to provide stability of value. A cryptoasset is not money (hence the term cryptocurrency is misleading) and has no intrinsic value because it has no backing. It can have extrinsic value, in the sense that people like to collect and own them, just as they like to collect and own all sorts of things, but that extrinsic value is highly unstable and could be nothing. I have met crypto enthusiasts who take the libertarian view that something backed by nothing has more confidence in value than something backed by the state. Suffice to say, that is not a view I agree with. With stablecoins, there will be backing assets, and therefore they could have intrinsic value. An immediate public interest question therefore is what will it take for them to be trusted as money, bearing in mind that while they will primarily serve the purpose of a means of exchange, any holding of them will also be a store of value, even if this is an incidental objective? Stablecoins have the potential to be systemic in terms of their importance for the financial system and its stability. As our paper describes, the precise definitions and mean of �systemic� in this context needs further work, but it will be linked to their ability to scale up and grow rapidly, and to become widely used as a trusted form of sterling-denominated payments by households and non-financial businesses.                                                     2/4                            BIS central bankers' speeches Any new form of digital money in order to succeed will need to be trusted as a store of value and as an accepted means of payment. Stablecoins must therefore promise, credibly and consistently, to be fully interchangeable with existing forms of money. In other words, they must be anchored in and thus maintain confidence in the monetary system. It is with this objective firmly in mind that the Bank of England�s Financial Policy Committee has set out its expectations to inform the design and regulation of stablecoins, and thus lay a clear foundation for sustainable innovation by setting out the public interest. The FPC�s first stablecoin expectation relates to the principles and expectations that payment regulation should aim to achieve. In this regard, UK authorities are already considering the regulatory approach for payments, including in response to both systemic and non-systemic stablecoins. The FPC�s second expectation relates to the use of stablecoins as money. This recognises that the Bank�s existing payments regulatory regime alone would not be sufficient to ensure the safety of a new form of digital money. Certain key features of the banking regime would also need to be reflected in any regulatory model meeting the FPC�s second stablecoin expectation. The Bank�s view is that these include: legal claim, capital requirements, liquidity requirements and eligibility for support from a central bank during a stress, and a separate backstop to compensate depositors in the event of failure. The regulatory model for stablecoins could include different applications of these features � as long as it offers equivalent protections to those for commercial bank money. As part of this, a key requirement will be to ensure that, unless the stablecoin is operating as a bank, the backing assets for stablecoins cover the outstanding coin issuance at all times. An alternative to a private stablecoin, but not a mutually exclusive one would be central bank digital money in the form of a central bank digital coin (CBDC). Central bank money has a unique role in anchoring value and promoting confidence in monetary systems. A CBDC could therefore play an important role in sustaining, and potentially expanding retail access to central bank money. I have discussed the public interest in the safety and security of money. But there is another very important public interest in this area which goes to the heart of the monetary and financial system. I mentioned earlier that commercial bank money combines in one place � bank accounts � the store of value and means of payment functions of money and in doing so enables lending to the real economy. What if new forms of digital money � Stablecoins or CBDC � result in a large scale displacement of commercial bank money which means that a higher fraction of money in the economy must be backed by high-quality liquid assets rather than by loans to the real economy, with this being necessary to preserve the stability of a now more fragmented financial system. In that event, real economy loans could be financed instead by more expensive sources of funding, reducing the efficiency with which commercial banks extend credit. This could lead to greater reliance on non-banks for credit provision as some borrowers find it cheaper to seek credit opportunities outside the banking system. I should emphasise that our work � and the scenario we use to illustrate these effects in the paper � does not at this stage suggest that the impact on lending rates and credit provision is more than modest. So this does not look headline making. But, there is a lot of uncertainty around how this could work out. We don�t know much about the likely demand for digital money, or about how it will be remunerated, all of which is important for determining these effects. The authorities may also wish to limit the speed and scale of any transition to digital money in the interests of greater assurance that there will be no threat to financial stability. Continuing with the provision of credit, greater reliance on longer-term stable funding by banks could reduce the likelihood of a sharp deterioration in bank credit conditions. However, banks will                                                  3/4                           BIS central bankers' speeches also be vulnerable to a deterioration in sentiment in wholesale funding markets. As a result, lending rates could be more volatile overall for those borrowers unable to access other sources of financing. And while there are potential gains from a shift to market-based financing, whether or not they are realised will depend on how the financial system adapts. As part of its responsibility for identifying, monitoring and taking action to remove or reduce systemic risks, the FPC will monitor any implications of a shift to market-based finance for UK financial stability. There could also be implications for money markets. The smooth functioning of these markets is important for the Bank to meet its objectives. Any large-scale reallocation of cash around the financial system has the potential to impact how money markets function. Hence, there is a risk of some disruption to money markets in the short-term, as new forms of digital money emerge. But in the long run, these markets should adapt to the introduction of new forms of digital money. I have talked so far about the impact of innovation in digital money in normal conditions. But, during a system wide stress, the availability of new forms of digital money could increase the proportion of banks� deposits that are withdrawn. Private liquidity insurance is calibrated to help mitigate liquidity risks. And, in aggregate, given existing liquidity resources, the banking system should be able to withstand sudden deposit outflows. But there is significant uncertainty around how smoothly such a deposit outflow would unfold, emphasising the importance of banks ensuring they have access to the Bank�s liquidity facilities. I hope from this you can get the sense of how important this potential innovation in digital money is, and why we must � both domestically and working with international partners � ensure that we understand and respond to the public interest issues that arise here, so that we can do our job of protecting stability, but also so that innovation can happen in a world where the public interest is well defined and protected. I am going to end � since time is up � by merely listing the other elements of public interest that I could, and probably should have covered, with respect to the innovation of digital currency, but which will have to wait for another day. I could have talked about monetary policy and controlling interest rates in a world of digital money. I could have talked about the public interest in competition in the financial system, about financial inclusion, and about data protection and privacy. I could have talked about the potential for digital money to speed up and reduce the transactions cost of international payments and transfers. And, finally, we cannot ignore the risks that digital money is attractive for money launderers and cyber criminals. All I can say today, I hope this gives the sense of the scale of this area of innovation and how important the subject is.

2021-07-02	Andrew Bailey: It�s a recovery, but not as we know it Speech by Mr Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, Mansion House, London, 1 July 2021.                                                * * * Introduction Lord Mayor, there has been nothing usual about the last sixteen months. Even long-standing neighbours like the Bank and the Mansion House have had to resort to video conferences rather than popping round for a word. And one of the trickiest issues for all of us is dress code and etiquette � is this a ties on or off video, who knows? I can admit that I don�t seem to be a very good predictor of dress code. But you did throw me not long ago Lord Mayor, when we had a video call about an hour before we were both speaking at an event, and I can reveal that you were dressed in a Mansion House bomber jacket. So, white tie to black tie to bomber jacket. I should say that by the time of the event, the Lord Mayor had changed into something more conventional. The story so far Conventional is not a word I have used about the performance of the economy in the last sixteen months. Last calendar year, UK GDP declined by an annual growth rate of 9�%, and based on our last forecast in early May we expect it to grow by 7�% this year. It�s more meaningful to express the level of activity relative to the end of 2019 (pre-Covid). At the end of last year, the gap was 7�%, on the latest numbers to end April it�s around 5%, and we expect the gap to be closed by the end of this year. Although that would still represent two years of lost growth, relative to the expected path of activity prior to the pandemic. The good news is that the economy is only around 5% smaller than it was eighteen months ago � and in view of what we have experienced, that is good news � and the gap is closing quite rapidly. But let�s pause for a moment on the good news that the economy is only 5% smaller. In any conventional time, even in the depths of a recession, that would scarcely qualify as good news. Let me add a second leg to this unconventional point. In a typical recession � to the extent there is such a thing � there is a hit to demand relative to the supply capacity of the economy which leads to an output gap, higher unemployment and weaker inflation. For crises such as wars or natural disasters, there can be a large decline in both demand and supply. But the effects on supply capacity are typically more persistent, for instance as a result of the destruction of physical capital. During the Covid crisis, we have seen a simultaneous and substantial fall in both demand and supply. But, all the indications are that for both demand and supply the decline will be temporary. There are I think three reasons for this. First, it is in the nature of the shock � Covid itself does not destroy economic capacity over the longer term in the same way as a war, although of course the number of lives lost has been tragic. Second, the evidence here and in other countries indicates that the economic impact of Covid has attenuated with each successive wave � we are all by nature adaptive in our behaviour. For that reason, both in the UK and in a number of other countries, GDP releases during more recent periods of restrictions have typically surprised to the upside, relative to our expectations based on the effect of previous lockdowns. Third, the economic policy response has been designed to ensure that the longer term damage � often termed scarring � has been as small as can be. This has involved both monetary and fiscal policy pursuing their own independent objectives in a consistent and complementary manner. And just to be very clear on this point, when we use the tools of policy                                                   1/5                           BIS central bankers' speeches consistently, and the objectives of policy are consistent, there is no compromise of independence whatsoever. So, we find ourselves now in a situation where there is an output gap, or slack as it is also called, but it is nowhere near as large as would be implied by the fall in demand if this was a normal recession. This is of course good news, but it is rather like one of those TV series which begins with a narrator saying, �Previously on��. This is a reminder of what has happened so far. What does the next episode contain? Well, the answer is that it hasn�t been anything near fully recorded yet, but we are of course very much in the action. The nature of the recovery I want to frame my assessment of that action in terms of two big questions that we face. First, as we experience a very rapid bounce-back, what conclusions can we draw on the temporary nature of the causes of higher inflation, and what should we look out for to judge if those causes might be more sustained? Second, when the bounce-back from Covid is done, and the temporary features have come to an end, what sort of economy are we likely to be in, and what does that suggest for inflation and growth? It�s clear that we are seeing stronger momentum in economic activity in many parts of the world, including here in the UK, in response to the progressive easing of restrictions and growing confidence of people to be out and about (as revealed in mobility data). The process of normalisation is very dependent on how the two big moving parts of supply and demand respond, whether they recover in synch or not. Where the recovery in demand outstrips supply, it is entirely possible that we will witness temporary periods of excess demand, or what more commonly we might describe as �bottlenecks�. This is especially likely within particular sectors, given the uneven nature of the recovery. In a �normal� recovery, signs that cost pressures were increasing and firms were experiencing capacity constraints, would be a clear warning sign that demand was returning close to potential supply. However, this is not necessarily the case now, because we expect both demand and supply to continue to recover towards their pre-pandemic levels. Consistent with this, we are seeing rebounds and normalisation of some commodity prices, though oil prices are now if anything rising above their averages of the last 5 or so years, while, for instance, in the US, lumber prices having risen sharply, are now retracting a sizeable part of that rise. There are plenty of stories of supply chain constraints on commodities and transport bottlenecks, much of which ought to be temporary. There are shortages of some products, notably semi-conductors, some agricultural commodities, and some end user products such as fitness equipment and home and garden furniture � the stuff we take solace in during a time of lockdown. Many of the factors behind these constraints are global in nature, reflecting shortages of products and transport capacity, set against the strength of the recovery to date and expectations of strong future growth. CPI inflation rose to 2.1% in May, just above the MPC�s target and above where we thought it would be in the MPC�s May forecast. Goods prices were strong, while consumer food prices ticked down slightly, and the pattern for services prices was very mixed. For instance, hairdressing and personal grooming inflation was strong in particular, at an annual rate of 8%, and saw a 29 year high. Pent-up demand, essential need, or recreating the early 1990s David Beckham look, I leave that to others to judge. Further up the supply chain, food input prices were up, and producer input inflation was around a 10-year high. However these price rises are certainly not universal, and for balance I should note that we also learned last week that Victoria Beckham is reducing the average selling price of her dresses by almost 40%.footnote[1]                                                  2/5                           BIS central bankers' speeches There are at least three reasons why the increase in inflation should be temporary. First, there are annual inflation base effects caused by very weak activity and prices last year which will not last beyond a year as a matter of arithmetic. But while they are present, they mechanically push up inflation. An illustration helps here. Let�s suppose that here in the UK, from May onwards, the consumer price level rises each month by an amount consistent with an annual rate of exactly 2% (i.e. at the inflation target). If that was so, the additional base effects from last year would mean that reported consumer price inflation would still reach towards 3%, before falling back to 2% next May. That�s the base effects at work. Second, and beyond that, additional price pressures can arise from the various shortages caused by imbalances in the recovery of supply and demand, as the latter recovers more rapidly than the former. But these imbalances should not last. Let me take an example from the US to illustrate. The continuous lumber contract � highly relevant for house building there � rose from around $400 pre-Covid to around $1700 in early May, as the price rose in the face of inelastic short term supply. However it is now down to below $800 as more lumber supply comes onto the market, and there is a shift to satisfy the higher demand at a lower price. Third, we expect to see a switch from demand for goods towards services as restrictions are lifted, which should rebalance the composition of demand. Over time, this should lead to an easing of inflation as spending is redirected towards sectors with more spare capacity. But, initially, that rebalancing may be uneven. Here in the UK, over recent weeks we saw an initial very strong pick-up in retail sales and restaurant table bookings, the growth of which has already eased off. Where supply returns more slowly than the initial surge in demand, we may see a temporary rise in prices. Let me turn now to the labour market, which is of course also highly important for this story. Here, too, the story has been far from normal. During the Covid period, employment has fallen much more than the rise in unemployment, albeit by significantly less than would ordinarily be implied by the decline in activity. Two things help to explain this. First, the furlough scheme has worked well to preserve jobs in firms or sectors temporarily hit by the effects of the pandemic and associated restrictions. Second, there has been a rise in inactivity, in other words those who do not have a job and are not currently searching for one. Turning to earnings, measures have been affected by compositional effects related to the changes in the labour market caused by the pandemic. On the one hand, lower pay for those who have been furloughed has dragged on average wages. On the other hand, the fact that job losses have been skewed towards lower-paid and part-time roles has boosted the measure of average wages for those still in employment. Initially the first of those effects dominated, and the level of private sector average weekly earnings fell during the middle of last year, such that for a while the growth rate was, unusually, negative. As the Covid period has gone on, however, the second effect has come to dominate. To illustrate the magnitude, a second little piece of arithmetic. Just suppose for a moment that, for the rest of this year, the level of average earnings is flat � what would be the peak rate of growth of the series? The answer would be 7% due to the sizeable base effect, and then it would fall back quickly, other things equal. Needless to say, 7% is a chunky growth rate for earnings, but on its own it would tell us nothing of real substance about the future. That is not where we should place most of our focus on the labour market. Our focus should be on whether, and how rapidly, people return to the labour force, and in what degree, a point I will come to in a moment. The risks to the outlook for inflation Let me now turn to what could cause things to turn out differently, and thus what we must watch very carefully. First, so far, we have seen a pick-up in import prices which has extended beyond energy prices, and we have observed these increases pass through into producer output prices,                                                 3/5                           BIS central bankers' speeches and now into consumer prices, to some extent. In some cases these increases reflect prices returning to pre-Covid levels, and in part they also reflect bottlenecks in supply chains as we experience a rapid but uneven recovery. There are good reasons to interpret this as a temporary feature, but we must be on the lookout for the risk that these features are more sustained. Second, we could see demand pressures on either side of the most likely outcome. Demand could be weaker if Covid continues to be a material health concern and prompts more caution in activity and spending habits. But there is also an upside risk that the substantial build-up of excess savings in the last year or so raises consumer spending to a larger degree than currently projected. Third, we could also see wage pressures arising if the number of people in work or seeking work does not return to pre-Covid levels, and inactivity remains at a higher level. A return of labour supply is therefore important. Fourth, a further challenge would arise if these temporary price pressures have a more persistent impact on medium-term inflation expectations, which shift to a higher level inconsistent with the target. As set out in the Minutes of the MPC�s June meeting, taking together the evidence from financial market measures and surveys of households, businesses and professional forecasters, the Committee judges that UK inflation expectations currently remain well anchored. It will be important to continue to monitor closely movements in measures of medium-term inflation expectations, however, and to adjust policy accordingly. The post-pandemic economy I want to look further forwards, to the second big question that will shape the performance of the economy. I have described the bounce-back of the economy from the Covid shock. But that does not tell us whether the experience of the last year or so points to a change in the underlying economic fundamentals that existed before Covid. This is a key question in judging the path of growth after this year and whether higher inflation will be transitory. Our current view, as set out in the May Monetary Policy Report, is that the economy will revert to the lower average underlying growth rates that we have seen since the financial crisis, other things equal. This will be accompanied by the continuation of low equilibrium interest rates around the world, which tend to be influenced by structural factors such as ageing populations and persistently low productivity growth. Reverting to the pre-Covid pattern of lower trend growth will bring its own challenges, and there is a strong argument for not accepting this state of affairs as either inevitable or acceptable. Stronger growth in potential supply supported by stronger investment and productivity growth will make the Covid recovery easier. The Covid shock has required an increase in public and business debt to smooth the impact. This is a necessary and sensible response. But that cost has to be managed, and it will be easier to do that with a higher trend rate of growth, boosted by stronger investment. Although business investment recovered from a low base following the financial crisis, it was weak in the period prior to Covid. Improvements in automation appear to have led to only modest gains in productivity and output. Might this be a reflection of the rather larger share of high labour input service industries in the UK and a lower share of manufacturing? Not really, because the pattern appears to hold at a sectoral level as well. This evidence points to the importance of raising productivity growth, supported by investment, in order to make it easier to handle the debt legacy of Covid and offer some protection against the risk that the decline in the labour supply during the pandemic proves more persistent. There is an interesting issue of whether such a change is already under way as part of the immediate response to Covid. Online retailing is an example of a sector where the impact has                                                   4/5                           BIS central bankers' speeches included higher productivity and investment to support the more digital service. Over the pandemic period, investment in intellectual property products (which includes things like investment in software and research and development) has held up better than other types of investment, particularly compared with investment in commercial buildings and transport equipment. This supports the idea that a move to digital is underway. It is too soon to tell to what extent changes seen over the last year or so will persist and further expand. But I think it is fair to say that more investment to support growth will be needed and that is why the Bank, Treasury and FCA have emphasised working with the financial sector to ensure the supply of productive finance to support investment is available. Let me conclude with a reflection on monetary policy. The economy is bouncing back rapidly, which is good news. With that has come a rise in inflation, and we expect that rise to continue in the near term as we go through the rest of this year, such that CPI inflation is expected to pick up further above the target, owing primarily to developments in energy and other commodity prices. I have set out the reasons why we expect this rise in inflation to be a temporary feature of the bounce-back. The reasons for taking this view are well-founded, it is not a vain hope or a matter of whistling in the wind. It is important not to over-react to temporarily strong growth and inflation, to ensure that the recovery is not undermined by a premature tightening in monetary conditions. But it is also important that we watch the outlook for inflation very carefully, which of course we do at all times, particularly for signs of more persistent pressure and for a move of medium term inflation expectations to a higher level. And if we see those signs, we are prepared to respond with the tools of monetary policy. Over the last sixteen months we have used monetary policy decisively to respond to an unprecedented crisis which was disinflationary. We were able to act in this way because the framework of monetary policy and the record of its use are robust. This credibility gave us the scope to act in a crisis. History has many examples of ineffective policy actions by weak institutions, and they don�t end well. Our credibility and institutional resilience were hard won. Next year marks the 25th anniversary of the MPC and the adoption of the objective of price stability. Memories of the instability of the previous approaches may be fading with the passage of time. I can assure you Lord Mayor that our focus will remain firmly on taking the actions that are required to maintain price stability over time. Thank you.

2021-09-28	The hard yards - speech by Andrew Bailey     Given at the Society of Professional Economists Annual Dinner i                                                     The hard yards ? speech by Andrew Bailey | Bank of England   Page 1 Published on 27 September 2021         Andrew Bailey looks at the varying forces currently acting on the economy and what they      mean for monetary policy.       One is the supply bottlenecks that are affecting the availability of goods and services.      While they will push up on the cost of living, that will likely only be temporary.       The labour market presents more of a puzzle. Job vacancies have been at record levels,      but as the furlough scheme ends, it is uncertain what will happen to hiring and wages.       The Monetary Policy Committee focuses on medium-term inflation rather than transient      factors. But if these factors are likely to be more persistent, the committee will step in and      adjust monetary policy as needed.    Speech I am going to speak this evening about the state of the economy and about monetary policy as the recovery from Covid unfolds. The title of this speech, The Hard Yards, is I think a saying that originated in sailing, though I associate it more with forward play in rugby. I remember saying, around a year ago when the recovery looked rapid, that the hard yards were yet to come, and while I don�t want to claim any great prescience, it appears to be turning out that way. Nor do I have any claim to originality � Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz wrote in their monetary history of the US that the most notable feature of the revival of the US economy after 1933 was not its rapidity but its incompleteness[1].  I, and other MPC members, have also used the analogy of a bridge to describe the role of economic policy in the age of Covid, the bridge to the other side of Covid. We are still on that bridge.  The rate of recovery has slowed over recent months, and that slowing is continuing. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, on the latest data to July, the level of GDP was 3.5% lower. That�s around one percentage point below the level consistent with the August Monetary Policy Report. There is a crucial distinction here between growth rates and levels of activity. It is inevitable in a bounce-back that the growth rate will slow as the recovery nears its end-point. It is not though inevitable � or desirable � that the previous level is not regained.  Recovery in some consumer-facing services appears to have been delayed. We had seen a recovery in activities such as eating in restaurants, but activity is levelling off, notwithstanding our contribution this evening. Consistent with the impact of supply bottlenecks and disruption, construction output fell in July, and manufacturing output stalled. Surveys and the reports of the Bank�s Agents, suggest the impact of these supply-chain issues is broadening out.  Pulling this together, the recovery has slowed and the economy has been buffeted by additional shocks. The switch of demand from goods to services, as Covid has faded in terms of its economic impact, has not taken place to date on the scale expected. Meanwhile, supply bottlenecks and labour shortages have weighed on output, and are continuing. Indeed the number of high profile supply bottlenecks appears to be increasing. I must say that when I heard that we were suffering a shortage of wind to generate power, I was tempted to ask, �and when are the locusts due to arrive�.                                                                      The hard yards ? speech by Andrew Bailey | Bank of England    Page 2 A number of these supply bottlenecks are not obviously a product of Covid, though others are. It is also possible that the economic fragility created by Covid has amplified the impact of other shocks � either that or the gods really are against us. I think it is more likely Covid amplifying at work.  I want now to turn to the labour market, because here we appear to have a big puzzle. Let�s start with the very good news. So far we have not seen a major upturn in unemployment or substantial corporate distress, despite one of the largest economic downturns in history. That is a notable success for economic policy all round. Put simply, if the authorities have the tools and the credibility, they can do a lot to help. And, it follows, that in such a situation they should do just that, they should not hold back.  But we are left with a puzzle in the labour market. Data from HMRC suggest that there were around 1.7mn jobs covered by the furlough scheme in July, and as a reminder it comes to an end later this week. The number of advertised job vacancies was at a record level in August of over 1mn. The number of people unemployed in the three months to July was 186,000 higher than immediately pre-Covid, and the number of inactive people was 634,000 higher. Now, of course, it is possible to reconcile these numbers, but to do so involves a lot of movement of people from furlough, unemployment and inactivity, in ways not so far seen.  There are a number of possible outcomes to this puzzle, which have different implications for the labour market. The first is that the furloughed workers will largely be re-absorbed into their old jobs, and so even with a further reduction in unemployment and inactivity, we are left with an excess of job vacancies. If these excess vacancies are associated with shortages of workers in particular sectors, this may push up on wages. This could also happen if furloughed workers do not return to their old jobs, but are not suitable for those jobs and sectors where there are a high number of vacancies. In other words, there is a mismatch in the labour market. Such an outcome is likely to raise the rate of unemployment consistent with stable wage growth i.e. the NAIRU.  The second outcome is different. Vacancies may be temporarily higher, and above their steady state level in the short-run, if firms are anticipating that it will be harder to find workers in the future when unemployment falls. In that scenario, demand picks up, the impact of matching frictions in the labour market dissipate over time, and both vacancies and unemployment fall. The NAIRU would be less affected in this scenario.  Another possible explanation is that the level of advertised vacancies is elevated due to employers overestimating the growth of demand to come just as the speed of the recovery falls off. In this case, some of the vacancies turn out not to be jobs as employers change their mind, or at least hiring is put back.  The implications of these labour market outcomes are quite different for growth, inflation, and thus monetary policy, which illustrates the uncertainty we face.  Before turning to inflation, I want to say something on earnings. On the face of it, headline earnings are elevated. Pay growth of around 8% for July (the latest available number) is very high. But there are a couple of Covid-related distortions that have been pushing up on this growth: there is a large base effect from the fall in average earnings last year, and a compositional effect from the pattern of impact of Covid on activity across the economy and how that relates to typical pay rises by type of job[2]. All of that said, we think the rate of growth of earnings in an underlying sense is probably around the 4% level � higher than we saw before Covid, and somewhat higher than we would expect to see in these economic conditions. But, there is another interesting development. The dispersion of pay growth has risen quite markedly � so for the high numbers we read about, there are also low ones. I am going to come back to this point.  The final piece of the economic picture I want to cover is inflation. Having been well below target last year and into this year, it has risen above rapidly, to 3.2% in August. Much of the latest rise reflects base effects from last year, but we have also seen unusually strong rises in some items, including some foodstuffs, used cars and accommodation. Our forecast in August had inflation rising to 4% by the end of this year, and developments since then mean that inflation is likely to rise to slightly above 4%. The major contributors to the further increase are not base effects but rather the strength we are now seeing in goods and energy prices.  Our view is that the price pressures will be transient � demand will shift back from goods to services, global supply                                                                      The hard yards ? speech by Andrew Bailey | Bank of England   Page 3 chains are likely to repair themselves, and many commodity prices have demonstrated mean reverting tendencies over time. But, the pressures are very much still with us, and there is still we believe pass-through to retail prices to come, and manufacturers� output prices are still rising rapidly. Added to that is the uncertainty around how the labour market puzzle resolves itself, and how that will affect employment and earnings. Meanwhile, just to remind, the recovery is weakening. A lot therefore turns on how effectively supply capacity is rebuilt and over what time, and how the labour market evolves. These are truly hard yards.  For most of the rest of my time, I am going to turn to the setting of monetary policy. Monetary and fiscal policy have operated independently but consistently � unsurprisingly I would emphasise � to provide the bridge through Covid, supported I should add by the stability of the financial system and macroprudential policy.  We have had to rely on asset purchases to do a lot of the work because of the proximity of interest rates to the lower bound. There is plenty of debate around QE, some parts of that debate are better founded than others. I am not going to cover that in any detail tonight you will be relieved to hear, save to make a few points relevant to the current context. First, we do think that the impact of QE is most pronounced in conditions of market instability, as we saw in March last year. Second, we think that a larger part of the impact of QE comes from the initial announcement of the stock of assets to be purchased, rather than the subsequent flow of purchases. As a reminder, the current round was announced last November when things looked bleak on the Covid front.  This begs a pertinent question: what impact do you get from continuing purchases in market financial conditions, and particularly at a time when inflation is rising as it is? The reason in my view is that QE does have an effect in stable conditions, and it is an important one, though I should emphasise on the second part of the question that because we regard the current upturn in inflation as transient, our view on the continuing role of QE is conditioned by our forecast in August that had inflation returning to target within an acceptable period of time.  One channel through which QE operates is to keep rates further along the curve down relative to where they would be otherwise. In that sense, the transmission mechanism is somewhat different to a change in Bank Rate, though the outcomes will likewise be seen in activity and inflation. For all the noise about QE, the key thing for me is that it has thereby contributed to keeping stable the cost of finance for companies during the Covid period, and that has been very important both for monetary and financial stability.  QE has also provided insurance against the sort of market volatility and dysfunction that we saw at the outset of Covid. It has therefore helped to prevent any liquidity-driven rise in yields, should such an event have occurred and in particular ensuring that the corporate sector was supported through this crisis. That said, the current programme of asset purchases is currently scheduled to end in December.  It follows that the monetary policy response, if we need to make one, to the inflation pressure should involve Bank Rate not QE. There is no reason to beat about the bush on this point.  Let me turn to that response. The MPC�s task is to set monetary policy to meet the inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The remit makes clear that it is appropriate to focus on inflation in the medium term, which is appropriate given the lags between changes in monetary policy and the impact on inflation. In our view, there are good reasons why the current above target inflation will be temporary, as I described earlier.  In considering how to use monetary policy, it is also important to understand the nature of the shocks that are causing higher inflation. The shocks that we are seeing are restricting supply in the economy relative to the recovery of demand. This is important because monetary policy will not increase the supply of semi-conductor chips, it will not increase the amount of wind (no, really), and nor will it produce more HGV drivers. Moreover, tightening monetary policy could make things worse in this situation by putting more downward pressure on a weakening recovery of the economy.  But what is crucial here is whether and how expectations of future inflation respond to these supply shocks, and thereby embed rising inflation. The most commonly talked about mechanism goes from higher inflation expectations, to companies feeling able to raise prices and employees asking for higher wages, to wage pressure and more persistent inflation. In this way, what start out as relative changes in price levels for some goods and services can                                                                     The hard yards ? speech by Andrew Bailey | Bank of England   Page 4 become generalised and turn into persistent inflation. I take this risk very seriously, it has form so to speak. That�s a world where people expect further price rises and thus seek to hold lower money balances relative to income than they otherwise would. But, in a world where people expect the price rises to be temporary and reversed, they will delay spending, and hold higher money balances relative to income than they otherwise would, and the growth of demand will be weaker. As a pertinent example, will second hand car prices stay elevated? Now, of course, it all depends on how badly you need that car, and in reality some price levels may stay elevated and some may not.  Monetary policy should not respond to supply shocks which do not become generalised through their impact on inflation expectations. In more modern times, and certainly in the life of the MPC, supply shocks have tended to be temporary in terms of their impact on inflation. But if that is not likely to be the case in our assessment, we will step in and adjust policy as needed. Nothing has changed in our approach.  To illustrate this approach, let me briefly summarise the announcement we made at the end of our meeting last week, drawing out the differences of view, which are very reasonable differences. The MPC emphasised that the inflation target applies at all times, with a clear focus on medium-term prospects for inflation rather than transient factors. The judgements required by this medium-term focus are particularly important and challenging at a time like this of very large shocks to the economy.  For most members of the MPC, the outlook for the labour market � as I described earlier � is highly uncertain and to some degree likely to be resolved in fairly short order, and this justified a wait and see approach on policy in view of the continuing belief that higher inflation will be temporary. Within this view, some members put more emphasis on the continuing shortfall in the level of GDP relative to pre-Covid, while others emphasised the continuing direction of travel towards closing that gap and the evidence of cost pressures accompanying the closing. But all of this group were of the view that the stimulus to monetary policy enacted in response to Covid would need to start to unwind at some point, that unwind should be enacted by an increase in Bank Rate, and if appropriate would not need to wait for the end of the current asset purchase programme.  The other view places more weight on current evidence of cost and price increases and accompanying signs of labour market and capacity pressures, leading to more persistent excess demand and higher inflation. Moreover, a policy change now would contribute to ensuring medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.  From this, I would draw out a number of important points. The great strength of the MPC process is that nine reasonable and I would say well informed people can differ on these interpretations, and we do so transparently. But, all of us believe that there will need to be some modest tightening of policy to be consistent with meeting the inflation target sustainably over the medium-term. Recent evidence appears to have strengthened that case, but there remain substantial uncertainties and we are monitoring the situation closely.  Let me finish with a thought which builds on the whole area of supply shocks. As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing currently a much greater dispersion of wage settlements. What if this is the beginning of a more far-reaching structural change in the economy which alters relative pay across occupations? To be clear, I am making no prediction here, but rather asking the question in the context of monetary policy. The first thing to say is that such changes do happen. Since the 1980s, we have seen a structural increase in the pay gap between higher and lower earners. We have also seen more structural changes in retirement ages over a longer time. So, structural changes can happen. It is not the job of monetary policy to prevent such changes, but rather to ensure that they do not have negative consequences for monetary stability, such as dislodging inflation expectations. On this point, it is worth remembering that an important reason why we have a positive rather than zero inflation target is to enable such changes in relative earnings to happen in a world of downward nominal wage rigidities.  I started by quoting Friedman and Schwartz, and so I will end by doing the same. They emphasised the need to distinguish a change in price (or wage) levels from a persistent increase in the rate of change[3]. In my view, drawing this distinction is a crucial issue that we will be dealing with for some time. And of course, since it involves predictions of the future, for policymakers the task will not be easy.  In conclusion, the yards will be hard I�m afraid, and we must stick to the task.

2021-11-04	Laying the Foundations for a Net Zero Financial System - speech by Andrew Bailey  It is a great pleasure to be at COP. What struck me was the range of the agenda over the COP fortnight and how diverse this essential agenda now is � from finance to gender and innovation to youth empowerment.  This is of course not surprising, as we know that climate change is an issue that will touch each and every one of us, the way that societies operate and the way that we live our lives, particularly as we emerge from COVID.  And a microcosm of this can be seen in central banks. When we started talking about climate at the Bank of England in 2015, our work was wholly focussed on the risks to the banks and insurers that we regulate. Six years later, the agenda has touched all areas of our organisation � from the way we heat our buildings, to the way that we manage our holdings of corporate bonds for monetary policy purposes. It is included in all of our remits and embedded in all of our decision-making processes. The Bank�s staff are actively involved as part of their day job or in the contribution they make to the way of life at the Bank, next week is our internal �green week�.  This is a mark of progress. The more we consider climate across our BAU activities and take informed actions on the back of those considerations � the better equipped we will be to facilitate a smooth transition.  That said, I have no doubt that this ever accelerating agenda can be hard to follow. So, today, let me try and piece together the different threads of the Bank�s work, drawing out some key areas where I believe we have reached a series of pivot points as to the scale of our ambitions in the future. And let me then set out where I think the next frontier of work will be and where we will usefully invest our efforts over the coming period.  The first pivot point is microprudential. Since we started our work on climate in 2015, we and the financial sector have come a long way. In particular, since the PRA set its climate-related supervisory expectationsfootnote[1] in 2019, we have seen a step change among senior executives and boards at firms. Some firms are exhibiting genuine ambition in how they embed climate-related financial risks, demonstrating what can be achieved and highlighting where other firms could, and should, do more. And we have been enabling firms on their journey, through the Climate Financial Risk Forum, a group of industry representatives chaired jointly by us and the FCA which has just published its second set of practical guides,footnote[2] and with a particular emphasis on aiding smaller firms which may not have easy access to the expertise needed for this new agenda. And of course we have shared all our learnings with international colleagues, whether on disclosure in the G7 or on supervisory expectations in the Basel Committee (BCBS) and the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS).footnote[3] But there is much further to go.  That is why, as we enter 2022, we will be shifting gears in our supervisory approach domestically to ensure firms are identifying and addressing climate related financial risks. Rather than focusing solely on enabling, we will through active supervision be focusing also on ensuring our supervisory expectations on climate are met.footnote[4] Where progress is insufficient and assurance or remediation is needed, the PRA will request clear plans and, where appropriate, consider exercise of its powers and use of its wider supervisory toolkit.  A key part of this toolkit is regulatory capital requirements, which help to ensure that firms have sufficient resources to absorb future financial losses. This supports their safety and soundness and contributes to the stability of the financial system as a whole. We already expect firms to hold capital against material climate-related financial risks and our existing toolkit enables us to take action. But we recognise capital may have a bigger role to play. Last week we published a reportfootnote[5] that sets out our thinking on capital and what further work is needed over 2022 to determine if further changes to the regulatory capital framework are necessary. Let me be clear. Regulatory capital can and should provide resilience against the consequences of climate change, namely financial risks. But it is not the right tool to address its causes. Addressing the causes � driving the transition - is for climate policy and is rightly the responsibility of governments.  The second pivot point is scenario analysis. We have spent several years developing climate scenarios as part of our work within the NGFS.footnote[6] Scenario analysis is a key tool for understanding how firms and our economies are exposed to the risks from climate change under a range of potential future pathways. The Bank of England,footnote[7] alongside more than twenty other NGFS members,footnote[8] is using these NGFS scenarios to run exercises, and as results come in over 2022 we will be able to assess the risks to the financial system. These scenarios are not just for use by regulators and governments, the NGFS deliberately made them openly available for use by firms whether in finance or in the real economy and other organisations in their own scenario analysis. The NGFS has also been open in how the scenarios have been constructed so that experts can challenge and suggest improvements.  We are now also starting to utilise the scenarios for a range of other topics, such as the impacts on the macroeconomy, both from the physical impacts of climate change as well as the different transition pathways to meet net zero commitments. The MPC has had its first discussion on climate change. Under the UK�s G7 Presidency this year, we have been able to catalyse action to prioritise furthering our understanding of the macroeconomic impacts of climate under different transition paths, with the G7 committing in June to embed climate change considerations into economic and financial decision-making, including addressing the macroeconomic impacts.footnote[9] And we will continue to work with other central banks, finance ministries, and international organisations to make progress on this important topic, including through the NGFS and the Finance Tracks of the G7footnote[10] and G20.footnote[11]  This brings me to the third pivot point. For the past two years, we have issued broad TCFD-based climate disclosures. These disclosures set out our climate change strategy and demonstrate how companies can and should share information about the measurement and management of climate-related risks. Over the coming days, we will be launching a new approach to investments by the Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme (CBPS), drawing on feedback on a discussion paper we published in May. Our approach will use our role as an investor for monetary policy purposes to incentivise firms to take meaningful actions in support of climate transition. It will therefore take an important step for central banks in focussing on the impact of the financial system on climate change, as well as vice versa. We are also implementing changes to achieve our 2030 milestone towards meeting our net zero emissions target for 2050 across all our operations.  That brings me nicely to international cooperation. For many topics we say global issues need global solutions. That may be even more true here than for other topics. No country, company or person can tackle climate change alone. We must continue to work together, after all that is why the 26th Conference of Parties is happening and why we are here. We play a very active role within the NGFS, where today the 90+ members, including the Bank, pledged their action. We chair the Sustainable Insurance Forum, contribute our thinking in the international standard setters and we will hear from some of these organisation in a few minutes. We will continue to play our role, a leading role.  In six years we have learnt a lot, achieved a lot, but as with everything on climate change, there is an awful lot more to do. We will look forward, challenge ourselves to go further, and deliver tangible action. Let me conclude by highlighting three points here. First, in terms of its economic effects, we are already beginning to see the impact of climate change. An example of this is energy prices � we must be able to manage the resilience and thus economic effects of the transition as we reduce the use of hydrocarbons but still rely on them. Second, we must ensure that the supply chains which will support the renewable economies of the future are robust, otherwise we will compromise the change we must achieve. Third, we must use the power of disclosure for companies to incentivise change over an acceptable timeframe. I know that last message is not always popular � it doesn�t have the message of stopping investment, but rather incentivising it to change in its impact - but it is realistic and will lead us to the goal that we must achieve. Thank you.  I am grateful to Theresa L�ber and David Gayle for their help in preparing these remarks.
